00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.809
 we are here today to treat 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 not one but two subjects 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:19.130
 will start with with this controversy that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 who started Monday at the end of the day 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.279
 and after to talk about the match of this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 weekend to lens you will excuse me 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.730
 usually I answer you without notes 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.980
 but to avoid a whole 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.570
 interpretation from May to 2 but I have 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.320
 preferred to take some notes 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.320
 and leaned on me 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 so if so by my lack of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 clarity 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.910
 imperfect semantic emma I could do 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.129
 that people felt shocked 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.629
 humiliated or hurt I'm sorry 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 interprets the interpretation that these 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.870
 people could do does not reflect in 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 nothing the thought that were mine and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 especially my humanist convictions 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 the debate was only a debate 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.490
 sportsman by no means political or 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:20.360
 societal when I talked about 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.530
 the cheapest african ready to fight 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.350
 I just wanted to talk about the young 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.930
 african player arriving in europe 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.520
 with all his will to succeed and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.820
 often to escape a situation 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 precarious 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 then since we were in 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 a debate about football intelligence 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.409
 that I evoked was obviously 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 tactical intelligence 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.649
 training young players in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.880
 Africa 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.229
 certainly for lack of means 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.540
 financial institutions or structures or 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.460
 infrastructure is not always 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.630
 as complete as that provided in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.969
 europe these young players there by force of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.149
 complete work very often very 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.330
 often lacks in their formation 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.180
 when they arrive on our continent 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.650
 I did not want to talk about 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.540
 intelligence in the true sense of the term 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.200
 individuals regarding certain 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.870
 accusations of which I could be the object 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.900
 accusations of racism 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.700
 I am 37 years old I have 30 to spend in 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 football locker rooms 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.130
 I never had a problem with who 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.130
 whether unfortunately and as 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.700
 this is often the case 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.340
 this sports- only debate devoid of 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 any color considerations 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.560
 of origin or religion has been moved 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.660
 by some people on the stage 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.570
 politics I regret that these same 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.970
 people do not read things until 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.970
 last or thursday 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.170
 in the same interview open the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.810
 quotation marks an eco goal is only a 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.910
 football team is like life is 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.970
 like France it's a mix or 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.300
 close the quotation marks and I am 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300
 proud to be french
