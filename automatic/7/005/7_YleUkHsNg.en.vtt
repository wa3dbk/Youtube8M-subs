00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 good friends of youtube in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.600
 this video I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.880
 paper heart is a very very model 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.440
 simple to make and that also beats or 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.049
 it does what it comes to be 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.369
 that pumps the blood or something like that is a 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.619
 very easy to do model that we will do to 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.970
 Starting from a square sheet does not matter 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.369
 what is also the leaf only matters 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.410
 that is square we will go from this point 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.450
 until this other bending down the diagonal 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 thus 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.670
 we will open and go from this point 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.670
 until this other bending easy 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.190
 and we will reopen now we will go from 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 here up here joining the two sides of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 this form 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.520
 and we will reopen 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.520
 and now we will do the same with this side 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.430
 A) Yes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.710
 this time we will not open 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.680
 we will take the paper in this way leaving 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.350
 the part that opens towards us like this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 and bending over these folds we've 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.040
 Done before 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.310
 we will go from this side to this first 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.020
 that we have here in the center like this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 we have to be given a kind of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.830
 triangle 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.750
 something like this 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 triangle with the two sides of the in the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.980
 center we will turn around and go 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.420
 from this side 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.170
 until the fold that we have in the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 center but not bending 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.020
 all together yes no 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.330
 joining this fold here with that of 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.330
 center one thing like this 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.180
 or a fold that separates you this 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.730
 angle in half 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.390
 we will stay something like this and with this 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.390
 side we repeat 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240
 well in this way 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.140
 from behind we have to have 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 something like this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.990
 well now we will go from this side of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.110
 here until this part of here doubling 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.110
 A) Yes 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.480
 and with this same side 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.550
 we will have left something similar to this 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 we will open and lift this tab 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.630
 here 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.540
 and by the folds that we have left 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.470
 for these folds we have done before 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.300
 we will push in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.340
 we want a kind of triangle in the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.340
 top part of this form 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.790
 we will have a triangle here 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.760
 this triangle 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.790
 ok now these tips we will raise them 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.859
 we will go from this tip of here to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 this point that remains here 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.269
 the triangle here there is a point then 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.269
 up to that point achieving in this way 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.650
 and with the other tip equal 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.540
 we have left something like this 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.930
 now we will go from this point here 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.720
 up here to where they cross this 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.200
 fold from here and this side this world 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 concrete 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.060
 we will fold in this way 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.140
 and with the other end we will do the same 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.510
 and we have to have something left 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.130
 like this 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.790
 unfold we have everything 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.150
 A) Yes 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.189
 and for this fold that remains here 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.960
 this fold here we will double the 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.640
 tips like that 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.640
 we will be something like this 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.950
 and here behind 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.750
 behind this part of here we will put 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.220
 these inside by the folds we have 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.860
 fact we have to be natural not 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.600
 you have to force it or bend anything you have 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.680
 to leave alone 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.680
 we produce this behind 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.510
 you have to see like this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.800
 now these tips here 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.740
 we will donate more or less at this height 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.930
 it is not an exact measure is how we 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.800
 It seems as we give it to be better 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.319
 worse is to likes if we have something left 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.569
 like this we will turn around and already 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.090
 we will have the heart and now to do 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:02.470
 that palpitate we place these two fingers 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.920
 these two on the bottom and this the 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.630
 thumb on the top 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.600
 and what you have to do is basically 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.530
 do so already two fingers up 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.670
 and this down do this movement 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:21.740
 make strength and throb so that so 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.290
 what is more or less the hunch of the 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.720
 heart and good then we can do it 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.200
 to give or for what we want is 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.240
 a very simple quick figure that remains 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.500
 pretty also moves and 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.900
 and very easy to do and nothing that has been 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.910
 everything if you liked it like 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.949
 tell me below what you think 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.550
 how could you improve or what you would like 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.009
 what I did and I do not know how to share with you 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.289
 friends if you think it's a video for 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.240
 share or what you want to do and 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.220
 nothing that has been everything we see ourselves in 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.460
 next videos thanks for watching me up 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.460
 other
