00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello people israelis yes yes I do 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.280
 video today on the different 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.050
 horse breeds and their first I have 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.929
 yes a total of five horses and a pony 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.460
 all are level 15 select my pony it 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 I'll live forever because I'm 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 just like that and we have each other 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.539
 Once a team Canada can be a frieze 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.039
 then each other lucia a trojan round 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.250
 a year away shot warm blood or too 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 known as horse at the beginning and yes me 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.760
 would like to talk to you about it now 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 what kind of horses are these ? 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.190
 then later hair with level 15 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.899
 and what i can recommend to you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 opinion for for example champion 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.020
 We started with the tanker 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.390
 the tinker has a strength with level 15 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.649
 of 21 a discipline of 19 of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.600
 speed of 17 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:58.489
 the exchange of 17 and agility of 18 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 The tinker is noticeable 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.640
 basically he is totally normal 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.670
 area like any other drives along too 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 level 15 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 except that he is at the strength 1 point 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.070
 has more races than any other 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.659
 which I have now, for example, is there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.890
 Of course, even more horse races can 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.100
 I will not tell you that now but from 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 My five ferries he has with level 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 5 have had the strongest strength for it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020
 but also a point in agility 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.420
 less than all other horses come 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.360
 we are to the peace of the frieze with the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.250
 andalucia so have the same 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 both worth the same because of this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 I read that only once before 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 nasty and the other have a strength 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 from 20 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 a discipline of 19 speed 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 of 17 the exchange of seats and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.540
 quality of 19 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 the rock and anna lucia is just like that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 middle thing between left and everything 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.450
 other so Vito viano or so or how 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.549
 an appaloosa and are just in the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.290
 more a bit weaker one 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.670
 point as the tinker had for it was a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 point in the agility higher and have 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 also the maximum speed and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 endurance what it can achieve a horse 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 so the speed and endurance 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.550
 is all the same leave 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.890
 it is not to say yes actually not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.490
 much on it I make you after my 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.910
 conclusion for the banks comes big brother 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.160
 big brother a to be a no and he has 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.500
 a strength of 19 discipline of 19 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 speed of 17 expression of 17 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.430
 Agility of 19 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.290
 so point had less in the stronger 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.000
 is with the discipline of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680
 speed and stamina alike 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 like the tanker of the frieze or the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.950
 but andalucia has committed again 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.870
 agility point more 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.050
 just as analysis again andalucia and the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.390
 friese stop and yes then we still have 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
 the year warmuth grows that's it 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.950
 Weakest value of all these are just 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.330
 the horses at first 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.650
 I do not know if she is from esso 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.170
 maybe just improve 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.870
 So their stats but have stop 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 a thickness of 17 of the 17 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.320
 speed of sitting out of it 17 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.570
 goes from 17 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.280
 So much weaker than everyone else 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.030
 horses apart from the speed 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.790
 and the endurance ago 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.130
 and yes my conclusion is now if you 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.959
 already prepared you should stop 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.080
 think about what's important to you 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.520
 when he says about me stumbling often times 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.840
 in between an obstacle and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.250
 my horse should not do that much 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.870
 if it is over then 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 Obstacle stumbles but then quickly 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 then it can be passed on, of course 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.530
 a horse with much more or more 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.690
 strength very well 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.580
 that means, for example, would be for 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.110
 you the tinker could be very good again 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.480
 pretty quickly getting back into gear 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.640
 Of course he is not so agile then 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.160
 like the anna lucia or the frieze or 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.690
 the tobi clue or wien apa loose or 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.250
 so is still a nice drive to 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.200
 Riding is just a matter of taste 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.260
 because every breed can be already 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.850
 I also find the body yes 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.620
 somehow it is different when you are 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.530
 the physique already jumps with them 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.910
 Much of the height and so on 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.830
 that is just imagination but also 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.980
 I do not find her every horse rider 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.229
 is it everytime something different yes 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.360
 the frieze and the analysis is for me 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.979
 a I for allrounder I'd say 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.030
 he has a damn good stronger though 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.069
 he gets stuck somewhere 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.330
 still quickly on trot as well as 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.639
 all other horses are good speed 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.860
 is equal to the endurance is the same but 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.560
 they have a slightly higher agility 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.229
 So that's one point, that is if you 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.729
 says if i stripe my but is 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.349
 nevertheless provide got there 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.719
 but I also like the agility very much 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.219
 important even if it is only one point 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.599
 yes, but sometimes a point makes a lot 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.039
 exterior walls are considered with the 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.500
 rate is at, for example, and 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.969
 if your real race car makes that 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.560
 a lot off whether we are one or two 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.750
 points closer in speed and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.430
 have broad or less the same 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.990
 Of course, it is also in terms of agility 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.460
 then come better around the curves and the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.409
 obstacles or maybe it could 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.569
 to take another abbreviate but also 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.139
 only with the field which has more agility 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.340
 or so is a flow and analysis 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.509
 stop for the euro 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.099
 you have to stop with their jumps 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.219
 get along and how they run in general 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:26.430
 but I think they are actually from the 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:29.490
 stats her so mittelding and of the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.729
 city ​​yes actually the best comes to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.270
 tobias otto viano yes has less strength 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.740
 as setting katar fluent anna lucia 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.659
 is otherwise equal except with the agility 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.330
 there he is again andalusia the frieze 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.509
 Again, I would like to be with big 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.129
 Brother divination if I always hang out 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.479
 Staying at the obstacle is for me that 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.610
 Run mostly because of that 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.589
 I do not pay attention to the strength 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.810
 agility is very important to me 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.240
 and I think the horse breed very much from 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.610
 physique very nice to ride from 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.500
 spring and so on and so on 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.529
 I like to advise with great shame 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.839
 Senate for me he is actually 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:09.000
 worse as the fries and 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.669
 analysis but I find him anyway 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.009
 nice to steer and therefore use 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.719
 I like him very much 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.719
 yes and the year is warm blood 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:20.719
 Of course not recommended 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.719
 absolutely 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.180
 yes, because he has of course now if you have 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.280
 says strength I need now 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.840
 Do not discipline the horse so quickly 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.890
 It is important for me to hear that 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.500
 horse fast on one 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.540
 reacts the less discipline the 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.080
 the less speedy it is 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.910
 also on 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.110
 that has something to do with the order too 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.210
 Do natural and agility also has two 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.220
 less points 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.480
 so he is the worst driver 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.920
 Anything for a championate 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.470
 unfortunately it can be so 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.120
 end it is still a yes it so yes 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.800
 again conclusion then friezes and fast 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.450
 analysis is the allrounder will be you 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.040
 dear strength is more important and he says 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.090
 my horse should not be such a drama 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.380
 make it out of it if I do 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.630
 obstacle travel you should perhaps 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.250
 take the tinker and if he says so 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.150
 come with the tiles the andalucia 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.280
 not so clear 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.190
 i prefer so and julian or 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.710
 appaloosa or a danish or warm 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.030
 so then I recommend you such a horse 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.470
 and yes, if you liked the video 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.880
 or you could help me you can 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.350
 like to give a thumbs up 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.640
 otherwise I wish you one more 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.970
 nice day and have fun at the 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.970
 Championships
