00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.719
 ameghino hack the eyebrow has expanded 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.769
 i economic globalization increased the number of global cities now 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.179
 we have about 70 at least 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.970
 China only has a huge territory five days later 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.339
 then this generates a kind 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.500
 irony or contradiction 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.980
 because the guarantee system so dominated and economic 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.520
 for finances 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.500
 a digital product 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.560
 that can circulate 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.970
 a sector that has a lot of power 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.229
 because they need global cities 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.229
 that is, the city secured it on a border walk 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.790
 for let's say implant 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.160
 a standardized globalized culture 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.030
 but at a very complex level 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.200
 inti colombia nacional 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
 that are still marked by their own specificity 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.200
 lessons 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.350
 workers modest classes 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.540
 the classes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.850
 traditional laws internal to their origins 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 I feel an infinite 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.240
 it does very well much more being the one that had sentenced internationalism 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 after the endorsement 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 It fulfills many functions and in kind of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.370
 today they are quality not only an arrangement like that the power 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 to the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.940
 the society 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.390
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.420
 consists 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.210
 who reside or 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.330
 so 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.990
 nowadays that is a space sufficiently complex to fulfill and 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.060
 that many things that happen there 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.460
 what constitute 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.570
 a new currency because I think that also 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.500
 the Ecuadorians who come here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.220
 they have to drive in the raja 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.790
 restaurant where they may be working 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.360
 to the fact that there is and one of Bolivia that cooks the distinct thing some of 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 Africa in Swiss bird 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.910
 cosmopolitan same stretches san luis 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.249
 and those are 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.579
 processes that my way of seeing constitutes 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.579
 globalia aires 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.699
 and what I believe or it is part of a job I'm doing now but 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.349
 really starts with this book territory authority rights 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 I believe that none of the fundamental changes 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.580
 d this modernity 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.580
 global that we are living 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.559
 etis that we have gone from a logic 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.449
 where he insists 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.469
 political and economic 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.769
 I really wanted 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.349
 include the room in the system logic was 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.339
 including people 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.259
 as consumers 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.639
 and as a worker was mostly but as consumers 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.039
 a process of 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.680
 include that it has nothing to do with magnanimity generously with 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.409
 illuminated 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.639
 it was the economic function 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.069
 Mass consumption 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.199
 massa housing production 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.739
 Manufacturing production of 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.739
 we had to be those of the limasa league 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.769
 the consumer is critical and the machinery is the president or the one 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.510
 be innocent in many countries 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.279
 in the 40s 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.279
 but with you in Spain that does not wait maybe a little different 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.469
 today 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.469
 if I wonder what is the logic of the system 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.299
 and if I stand 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.189
 to the cistern limit 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.119
 of gold 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 a process of incorporation as a consumer 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.499
 the process today has expulsion 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.989
 you need - d consumption everything matters but the logic internal to the system 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:55.259
 that is mind dominated by porn only for finance 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.409
 but by the financialization of more and more sectors 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.319
 indicates that there are inter-modalities 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.819
 to generate 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.549
 an immense surplus value 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.549
 do not need people 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.769
 now that changed position 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.039
 tilton man assume 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.379
 formats 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.009
 very very different 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.509
 last year only 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.270
 10 million people have added water year the displaced is a 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330
 military system category in the national 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.960
 by half in 10 million 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.080
 one year 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.419
 now we have a total of 42 million 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.729
 for this procedure a small part 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.020
 when china against trinidad hectares in zambia 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.320
 to placate 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.930
 in palm to make it look 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.090
 the process of mass expulsion 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.090
 not only from a fable there a flora 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.620
 of small farmers 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.039
 of entire villages 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.710
 3 the system the brilliant expulsions and ponzio understand the countries of the north 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.029
 united states and united yemen that are and a vanguard in terms of this one 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.240
 the little liberalism that we are living 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.669
 these and another 7 million people 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.270
 there is a young majority 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.490
 in prisons the presence of many types of pressures but that his mother 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.200
 born 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.499
 as a cathedral 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.499
 some of them really are real killers 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.189
 who better they are company 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.300
 but most do not 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.680
 brussels have been expelled 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.569
 the prison that has now become a private company are more those who better 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.419
 It's like a hotel 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.710
 each person 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.270
 add project 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.400
 efe the system internally generates its own possibilities of excuse ar is a 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.040
 very radical analysis that you are seeing but and there are many different modalities 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.879
 Spanish is precisely why that cosmopolitan d production and 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.139
 modern pulares try ellis among the poor 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.059
 It is very important because a force is a force that 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.470
 that unites us instead of dividing between different 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.699
 that nationalism 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.629
 if they start to amalgamate a little 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.159
 the opera and the country 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.349
 and here 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.710
 the other element is that there is there city 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.210
 just a moment 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.860
 territorial 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.939
 of these circuits 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.469
 os x a moment where it becomes visible becomes concrete are 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.300
 women and men 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.229
 who want their lifestyle mark the urban space with its people and almost 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:38.600
 year 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.560
 the instrument of confrontation 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.029
 because a lot of the circuit 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:44.479
 we do not see it 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.879
 that has also become mimetic network of spaces and see in spaces 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:51.080
 d what country is simply 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.740
 luxury space 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.189
 but they are not active production spaces 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:59.189
 of new possibilities the cultures from 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.389
 for me the city of Valencia is 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.620
 is the third element that today that first time as the threshold one 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.180
 new formation nosa mexicana we forget 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.189
 another thing 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:12.569
 second moment 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.539
 the expansion of the moment rate system in the context of this new 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.129
 Fusion logic scheme that undo 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:22.279
 and also a space of active confrontation 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.279
 I believe that tunisia could not have gone without his city 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.649
 what happens in your mission 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:30.509
 what can not be otherwise is not in the revolutions 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:33.349
 the forensic doctor knows what is happening in europe 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.559
 this sentence is a space that 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:40.189
 puig inia and was mobilized historically it is not the first time but with india 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:42.409
 are different mobilizations be
