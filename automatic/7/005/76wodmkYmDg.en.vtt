for a few of these because I test the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.720 
for a few of these because I test the
radiators<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> office<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:17.130> sure<00:00:17.520> if

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
radiators in the office and I'm sure if

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.010 
radiators in the office and I'm sure if
you<00:00:17.970> guys<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.300> excited<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> few<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> these

you guys are excited for a few of these

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
you guys are excited for a few of these
because<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.680> seem<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.220> quite<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
because we do seem to see quite a bit of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.000 
because we do seem to see quite a bit of
hype<00:00:20.910> around<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.750> quiet<00:00:22.020> coolers<00:00:22.439> first

thing<00:00:23.189> you're<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> notice<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
thing you're going to notice is that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.210 
thing you're going to notice is that
there's<00:00:24.570> no<00:00:24.630> flat<00:00:25.050> top<00:00:25.380> classically<00:00:26.070> these

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there's no flat top classically these

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.980 
there's no flat top classically these
have<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> flat<00:00:26.849> top<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.359> know<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> guys

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
have a flat top I know some of you guys

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
have a flat top I know some of you guys
are<00:00:28.170> looking<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.890> guys

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
are looking for that some of you guys

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.290 
are looking for that some of you guys
aren't<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> didn't<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> before

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
aren't so if you didn't like that before

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.870 
aren't so if you didn't like that before
they<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.080> come<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.410> even<00:00:31.769> more<00:00:32.009> angles<00:00:32.669> just

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
they now come with even more angles just

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.250 
they now come with even more angles just
in<00:00:33.030> case<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.300> exactly<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> wanted

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
in case that's exactly what you wanted

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
in case that's exactly what you wanted
and<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.640> their<00:00:35.790> older

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and if not you can still get their older

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.119 
and if not you can still get their older
products<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.510> sure<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> problem<00:00:37.170> one

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
products I'm sure not a problem one

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
products I'm sure not a problem one
thing<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> fan<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> six<00:00:39.600> pole

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
thing with the fan is that is a six pole

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 
thing with the fan is that is a six pole
pwm<00:00:40.440> fan<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.860> pwm<00:00:41.399> fans<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.910> i'm<00:00:42.059> sure<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.270> lot

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
pwm fan with pwm fans as i'm sure a lot

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
pwm fan with pwm fans as i'm sure a lot
of<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.260> tend<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> tick<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.219> six

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
of you know they tend to tick with six

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
of you know they tend to tick with six
poles<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.300> shouldn't<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.750> as

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
poles in them they shouldn't take as

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.000 
poles in them they shouldn't take as
much<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.260> sure<00:00:46.469> we'll<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.649> able<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> check

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
much I'm sure we'll be able to check

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
much I'm sure we'll be able to check
that<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> office<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> later<00:00:48.420> date

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that out in the office at a later date

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
that out in the office at a later date
something<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> might<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.649> noticed<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
something you might not have noticed is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
something you might not have noticed is
that<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.059> actually<00:00:51.090> about<00:00:51.660> three

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that these are actually about three

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
that these are actually about three
millimeters<00:00:52.170> shorter<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:52.980> used<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> be

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
millimeters shorter than they used to be

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
millimeters shorter than they used to be
case<00:00:53.730> compatibility<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> always<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> problem

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
case compatibility is always a problem

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.139 
case compatibility is always a problem
with<00:00:55.440> every<00:00:55.710> type<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> cooler<00:00:56.219> air<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.789> water

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
with every type of cooler air or water

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
with every type of cooler air or water
but<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.109> air<00:00:58.800> coolers<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
but with air coolers you got to get that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
but with air coolers you got to get that
height<00:01:00.090> down<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.629> should<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.140> lot

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
height down so these should be a lot

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
height down so these should be a lot
more<00:01:01.379> compatible<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.399> cases<00:01:03.049> we

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
more compatible with a lot more cases we

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
more compatible with a lot more cases we
have<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> variance<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.799> sizes<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> other

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
have a variance of sizes but the other

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.250 
have a variance of sizes but the other
most<00:01:05.939> notable<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:06.990> sure<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> lot

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
most notable one because I'm sure a lot

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
most notable one because I'm sure a lot
of<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> familiar<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.100> their<00:01:08.400> dark<00:01:09.360> rock
