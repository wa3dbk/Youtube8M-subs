00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.370
 after more than a week of thresholds 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.320
 GANIC MAURITIUS is surprised by the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
 cabin visibility on his 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.160
 environment and through maneuverability 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.210
 trunk the gear in the most spaces 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.210
 of its exploitation 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.840
 overall it's an ax and they 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.500
 will be easy enough but who gets caught 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.390
 easily in hand 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.650
 so at first a little bit surprised because 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.250
 that it will change us front loaders 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.290
 on a tractor like china as one 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 says so well articulate them so she gets 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.460
 breaks so it's a certain habit to 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.770
 take the start but we take it 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.630
 pretty fast in hand so too we are 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.830
 initially surprised at the islands the arrow goes 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.350
 we embarrass her she's right in the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.460
 field of view 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.680
 it's a phenomenon that hinders us 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.050
 little bit initially and we realize 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 that ben the city it does not bother at all the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.720
 visibility and very good visibility 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.979
 whether on the hill and in front 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.850
 because we realize we have a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.009
 hood diving if behind who who we 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.750
 gives a very correct visibility 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.790
 otherwise we have the roof the roof 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.619
 panoramic so the same if we do the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.330
 stacking or something else we are not embarrassed 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.650
 we really sit down we do not have 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.440
 need to swing to look at 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 right to left above we have a 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:44.289
 common working comfort that is very 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.610
 well and ben and 3 especially a building I 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.350
 see the bulls building and enough 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.270
 confined one has a scraping lane that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.479
 does that three meters 20 wide and on 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.979
 40 meters long so we have the whole 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.710
 length of the building to do so that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.509
 must be a fairly meticulous and in addition 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.450
 when we go out to go stack in the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.310
 bucket or in the manure so that's 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.619
 pretty crazy is mythical hull and when 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.209
 even so much less intention he 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.860
 step back one step forward and at the 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.709
 bn LacharriÃ¨re one starts in the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.490
 really surprised building it turns into 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 a handkerchief 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.440
 if the front passes the back pass and 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.209
 precisely we have a not very wide reach 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.340
 since it is only 3 m 50 m and 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.080
 frankly with the bucket it was going 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.370
 very good very good visibility it takes 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.709
 be careful because too limited 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.200
 by the height but really not embarrassed that 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.890
 went very well 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.390
 automatically I will save time 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.520
 since already at the level of the force of 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.200
 lifting there we can lift 3 mower 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.850
 while with a fork on a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.620
 traditional tractor one is rather 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.060
 around tons so automatically I 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.520
 will save time loading manure 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.770
 to do my cleaning do the cleaning also 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.910
 automatically since I have for 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.620
 turn in the buildings a little bit 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.330
 cramped is an approach that is a lot 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.800
 easier 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.070
 yes, I'll have time for sure 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.420
 now estimated time I do not know 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.420
 I did not step back 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.940
 this is a machine equipped with the group 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.720
 without singh so she does at the level of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.320
 hydraulics we do not need 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.990
 accelerate 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.490
 we have a tearing force or a 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.470
 lifting force that is there without having 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.060
 need to have a constant engine speed 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.160
 in slow motion it works very well 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.450
 so if you do a cleaning and your 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.490
 good and right next you have not 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.220
 need accelerator to accelerate so 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.780
 I think that ronnie your consumptions 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.490
 I did not make the consumptions by 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.470
 compared to the hours I did but I 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 think that at the level of consumption it must 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.820
 to be not bad because I worked 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.260
 precisely with a very low regime at 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:44.880
 slowed down to say I was a friend of a 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:47.790
 thousand turns 1000 1200 rounds by all his 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.980
 pores feeling of insecurity since on 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.270
 the gear we have a law of articulation 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.270
 still who works as well 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.760
 vertically that 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.530
 reversal is really at the level 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.379
 stability we can have the sells really 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.599
 which is a stadium that is sure to climb 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.280
 on a tackle with one before the hands 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.139
 balanced but not at all stabilize 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.939
 but the back in return if the 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.510
 on a flat place will remain flat so the 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.410
 father stability 0 to 10 months I would say 8 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.940
 because I have not used since 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.090
 long time discreet will not use 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.930
 to pack a silo for example so I 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.930
 do not know, I can not do anything 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.820
 otherwise what I blame it a little 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.669
 which is not a mirror in the back 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.930
 telescopic since if I want 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.940
 to attack a cart or something else I 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
 can not I have nothing to guide that would be 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.169
 not bad that there is a mirror and that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.370
 would not be bad too that the gear I 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.889
 is unfortunate that it is not approved 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.150
 with a trailer on the road since 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.789
 is years still make transport 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.930
 of not they go that tomorrow if I have more 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.130
 that on the exploitation me I am 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.470
 annoyed I have to take a 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.940
 second tractor what to take a 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.570
 tractor slab with the gear in the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.550
 empty field 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.960
 so all that is monopolizing another 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.060
 driver is in the other 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.500
 today it does not suit us 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.370
 must by one will be absolutely blogging for 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.370
 shoot warrant 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.670
 ganic maurice also appreciated having 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.560
 automatic stall of tools 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.290
 but finds it unfortunate that there is no 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.010
 automatic weighing system 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.220
 indispensable for food 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.220
 animal
