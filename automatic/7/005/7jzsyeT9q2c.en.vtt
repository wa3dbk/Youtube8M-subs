00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everybody we are here with one more 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.170
 video tutorial will teach you how to do 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 a motorcycle or battery charger. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 using a notebook or notebook power supply. 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.390
 portable computer 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 here I have this source that gives positive 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:36.719
 will give focus very positive input of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:39.350
 100 packages without volts at 240 volts 227 50 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.350
 to 60 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 I left 18.5 volts continuous 35 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:59.100
 this source here here the entrance people 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:03.809
 puts the socket and here is the output and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 Here, this floor is like this. 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.450
 This chrome-plated exterior is the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 negative 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 right then the inner part will be the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 positive is the positive is actually so 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.700
 how are we going to do will 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 need two distinct strands here I 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.509
 I'm wearing red your positive and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.950
 a blue to be the negative 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:44.990
 there we will also need the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.990
 cut to be able to cut the wires 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:02:04.200
 here you are going to cut a little bit 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:06.090
 small macapÃ¡ the wire used in the positive and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.119
 A negative we'll cut a little 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.119
 bigger to it a little bigger 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 and here we will have to make the sea 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:34.080
 collar to be able to hug the negative part 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.310
 will open a thread like this in two branches 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:48.180
 take the negative part and let's put 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 here join the two parts and 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:12.860
 firm wire confirm it is already connected 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:12.860
 a negative b positive you will put 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.020
 there it points blue it's the negative it's the tip 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.980
 red is the positive here you go 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:35.370
 put the battery positive on the battery 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.459
 will leave there for about 30 minutes in the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.459
 maximum 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.010
 motorcycles any bike battery more 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.709
 30 minutes will end up boiling the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.709
 liquid that has within its 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.300
 property and ends up killing the battery 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.790
 then more than 30 minutes 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:09.530
 I do not recommend it until 30 minutes is 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:13.100
 tolerant of the maximum load and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.100
 the battery 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.770
 to get better you have this connector here 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.670
 O 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:27.570
 You use instead of doing this. 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.880
 positive child's gambiarra or 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.240
 negative 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:40.320
 here you will get the positive and negative 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.130
 in the same way that you will fit a 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.130
 another here 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.080
 on the other end you put this connector 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.640
 does the same on the bike 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.910
 I called together a lamp also have 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.720
 sure that there is energy and now 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.720
 take a test here 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.550
 right 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:55.879
 so there's a battery charger 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:00.770
 to bike here with the source 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:04.520
 notebook a laptop 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:08.330
 both the score with the bike has its motorcycle 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:15.439
 It's not too long, and I'm going to leave. 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:19.520
 I did not use it, you 'll be able to 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:23.270
 go easy with 30 minutes 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.750
 It's alright, I hope you like it. 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.210
 video is the last one for me 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.340
 much used in use until today in my 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.719
 moto 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.719
 It was worth another video when
