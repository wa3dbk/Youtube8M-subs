00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
that's Doug Smith the trial started and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.190 
that's Doug Smith the trial started and
your<00:00:02.460> team<00:00:02.669> has<00:00:02.820> fought<00:00:03.030> back<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> lot<00:00:03.540> all<00:00:03.870> year

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
your team has fought back a lot all year

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.019 
your team has fought back a lot all year
but<00:00:04.350> it's<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.740> holes<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.250> put<00:00:05.460> yourselves<00:00:05.819> in

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
but it's the holes you put yourselves in

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.299 
but it's the holes you put yourselves in
that<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> more<00:00:07.109> problematic<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.069> all<00:00:08.189> right

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
that is more problematic as it all right

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.459 
that is more problematic as it all right
no<00:00:08.460> question<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.750> thought<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> second

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
no question I just thought the second

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.990 
no question I just thought the second
quarters<00:00:10.860> when<00:00:11.070> they<00:00:11.400> ramped<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
quarters when they ramped up the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.230 
quarters when they ramped up the
pressure<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:13.500> had<00:00:14.070> six<00:00:14.370> turnovers<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
pressure I had six turnovers which is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660 
pressure I had six turnovers which is
huge<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.800> difference<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.340> game<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
huge and the difference in this game is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.370 
huge and the difference in this game is
the<00:00:17.760> turnovers<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.840> got<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> meet<00:00:19.199> their

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the turnovers we got to meet their

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.500 
the turnovers we got to meet their
physicality<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> understand<00:00:20.850> how<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
physicality we got to understand how the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
physicality we got to understand how the
fishes<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.230> calling<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> game<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.130> play

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
fishes are calling the game and play

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.689 
fishes are calling the game and play
accordingly<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.990> thought<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.170> uh<00:00:25.699> 19

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
accordingly I just thought that uh 19

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
accordingly I just thought that uh 19
turnovers<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.510> lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.199> those<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.619> getting

knocked off our mark and we just got to
be<00:00:31.710> strong<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> ball<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:33.050> accordingly

be strong with the ball or accordingly

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.300 
but what did you think of your group I
thought<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.359> was<00:03:55.450> solid<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:56.019> accept<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:56.950> second

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
thought it was solid I accept the second

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.130 
thought it was solid I accept the second
quarter<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.730> thought<00:03:58.329> they<00:03:58.540> impose<00:03:58.870> our<00:03:59.109> will

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
quarter I thought they impose our will

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.080 
quarter I thought they impose our will
there<00:03:59.680> will<00:03:59.890> of<00:03:59.920> us<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.549> second<00:04:00.910> quarter

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
and did a good job of bringing

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.670 
and did a good job of bringing
physicality<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.450> thought<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:05.260> turned<00:04:05.500> it

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
physicality I thought we turned it

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.979 
physicality I thought we turned it
around<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.489> fourth<00:04:06.760> quarter<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.329> matter

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
around in the fourth quarter and matter

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.860 
around in the fourth quarter and matter
mmm<00:04:08.470> but<00:04:08.829> like<00:04:09.010> doug<00:04:09.250> said<00:04:09.519> we<00:04:09.730> can't<00:04:10.000> wait<00:04:10.239> to

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
mmm but like doug said we can't wait to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.420 
mmm but like doug said we can't wait to
the<00:04:10.989> fourth<00:04:11.230> quarter<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:12.100> meet<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the fourth quarter to meet the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640 
the fourth quarter to meet the
physicality<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.269> adjust<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.350> way<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
physicality and adjust to the way the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.219 
physicality and adjust to the way the
fishes<00:04:15.010> are<00:04:15.100> calling<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.519> game<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
fishes are calling the game in the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.680 
fishes are calling the game in the
fourth<00:04:17.440> quarter<00:04:17.820> if<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.209> fishes<00:04:19.570> are

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
fourth quarter if the fishes are

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.090 
fourth quarter if the fishes are
allowing<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.709> physical<00:04:21.159> play<00:04:21.310> we<00:04:21.549> gotta<00:04:21.880> play

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
allowing the physical play we gotta play

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.250 
allowing the physical play we gotta play
that<00:04:22.310> way<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:23.120> that's<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.750> difference<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.230> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
that way so that's the difference in the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.100 
that way so that's the difference in the
game<00:04:24.350> we<00:04:24.680> got<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.950> do<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.870> Duane<00:04:26.870> Ryan

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
game we got to do that Duane Ryan

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.440 
game we got to do that Duane Ryan

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
into some trouble when it goes to the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.610 
into some trouble when it goes to the
ISO<00:04:32.450> ball<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.080> sort<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> happened<00:04:33.590> in

ISO ball and that sort of happened in

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.650 
ISO ball and that sort of happened in
the<00:04:33.740> third<00:04:33.980> as<00:04:34.160> well<00:04:34.370> how<00:04:34.610> much<00:04:34.730> of<00:04:34.940> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
the third as well how much of the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.630 
the third as well how much of the
offense<00:04:36.020> was<00:04:36.140> by<00:04:36.320> design<00:04:36.500> isolation<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.580> I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
offense was by design isolation and I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.190 
offense was by design isolation and I
which<00:04:37.760> was<00:04:37.940> what<00:04:38.090> they<00:04:38.180> were<00:04:38.240> giving<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.750> lot<00:04:39.050> of

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
which was what they were giving a lot of

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.450 
which was what they were giving a lot of
it<00:04:39.320> was<00:04:39.530> what<00:04:39.710> they<00:04:39.860> were<00:04:39.950> doing<00:04:40.100> Ryan

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
it was what they were doing Ryan

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.210 
it was what they were doing Ryan
switching<00:04:41.240> got<00:04:41.930> us<00:04:42.050> in<00:04:42.200> those<00:04:42.380> situations

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
switching got us in those situations

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.270 
switching got us in those situations
we've<00:04:43.790> got<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.000> make<00:04:44.180> quicker<00:04:44.480> decisions<00:04:44.570> I

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
we've got to make quicker decisions I

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.650 
we've got to make quicker decisions I
thought<00:04:46.280> we<00:04:46.700> took<00:04:46.880> advantage<00:04:47.120> of<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.630> few

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
thought we took advantage of it a few

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.740 
thought we took advantage of it a few
times<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.830> too<00:04:49.340> many<00:04:49.490> times<00:04:49.880> we<00:04:50.180> got<00:04:50.330> stagnant

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
times but too many times we got stagnant

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.660 
times but too many times we got stagnant
by<00:04:51.530> not<00:04:51.740> moving<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.220> ball<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.580> that's

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
by not moving the ball and that's

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.220 
by not moving the ball and that's
something<00:04:52.910> we<00:04:53.120> got<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.450> do<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.570> better<00:04:53.630> job<00:04:53.840> with

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
something we got to do a better job with

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.880 
something we got to do a better job with
incoming<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.100> next<00:04:55.340> uh<00:04:55.400> next<00:04:55.910> game<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:57.500> key

incoming the next uh next game the key

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.040 
incoming the next uh next game the key
thing<00:04:57.920> is<00:04:58.160> moving<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.150> ball<00:04:59.300> without<00:04:59.540> turning

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
thing is moving the ball without turning

thing is moving the ball without turning
it<00:05:00.260> over<00:05:00.410> that's<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.980> whole<00:05:01.160> key<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:02.180> know

it over that's the whole key you know
they<00:05:02.390> had<00:05:02.510> 16<00:05:02.960> points<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.440> 19<00:05:03.830> turnovers

gives that small ball gives them a
little<00:05:47.990> bit<00:05:48.320> of<00:05:48.410> an<00:05:48.530> advantage<00:05:48.710> but<00:05:49.070> with

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
little bit of an advantage but with

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.810 
little bit of an advantage but with
Patrick<00:05:50.380> one<00:05:51.380> thing<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:51.740> does<00:05:51.920> is<00:05:51.950> allow<00:05:52.370> us<00:05:52.640> to
