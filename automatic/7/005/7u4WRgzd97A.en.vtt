00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.529
 My name is Maxim and 11 years old I want 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.150
 fly on an airbus simulator 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.830
 a320 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 my name is vyacheslav genug stupid lines 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.320
 peri structures taught on airplanes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 airbus 320 series I will help in fact not that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 maxim and so maxim is ours 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 wonderful simulator 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.779
 and what are the dimensions of this apparatus of his 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
 weight 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.880
 about 5 tons is all given 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 electro hydraulic actuators for 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 to be understood as a sensation 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 so that the pilot feels 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 yes yes yes yes what was very similar to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.230
 reality in fact on the simulator 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 about 95 percent of sensations for sure 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.920
 same as on the plane one to one 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 but now let's go see what's in there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 is inside I sort of virtually 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 flying on my computer is complete 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 imitation 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 the cabin is only there not to click the mouse yet 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 do eggs representing something such she 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.989
 I did not think that on such grand 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 sizes that we smoke here is our wonderful 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.770
 simulator here is exactly the same 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.920
 as in the plane of the panels azis is the remote 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 control of the entire simulator 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.060
 Instructor's bullet controls 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 trust eyes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.610
 air brakes like this 1 1 1 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.470
 I remain very small movements among 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.430
 the provisions then fly nowhere but sense 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 Just the fact that I am telling 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.560
 the pilot and now we will take the headset 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.430
 you will get 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.890
 wear close idioms too know that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.210
 ok beef stitches from down the line then 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 let's output together the output first to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:57.440
 50 and now two times let's get up to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 15 degrees still great still still more 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.050
 I like but to lead the plane is difficult as fly 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.570
 director what you need all the time 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.290
 maintain without preparation and there they are 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:21.930
 really just learn right here 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.270
 place right price well done we are only 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.870
 that the viewer from Prague took the height of 7000 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:34.770
 crt now we will be preparing for call 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.110
 to land on the same lane 24 in Prague in 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.030
 principle this is not jessie up on blood up 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.570
 of this yes we have everything and for the sake of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.700
 facilities 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.800
 set up now we will be releasing 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.350
 mechanization until the plane will put out 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.270
 speed so at that high speed 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.020
 don't sit down yes there was a situation not 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.060
 good enough dance very 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.730
 the car counted here it is for you 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 displayed 136 for the current mass for 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 Fortunately the current circumstances there is no let 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.510
 bellowed 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.470
 both well done lights include perch here 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.030
 included yes here one or two and call 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.220
 passengers to be fastened 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.700
 check again manhunter debuff 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.700
 continue 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.900
 landy 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.470

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.470

 no more than 20 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.609
 he said the demise of linings i realized that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.950
 it keep landing but i'm used to 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.370
 speak online well, and so I understood him all 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.859
 This is an international aviation language Maxim 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.060
 finally we landed in prague not 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.319
 want to say goodbye to the passengers let's 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.340
