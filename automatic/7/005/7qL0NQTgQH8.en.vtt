00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
power envelope of the card is so much

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.719 
power envelope of the card is so much
lower<00:01:14.549> than<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.030> fully<00:01:15.240> fledged<00:01:15.570> fury<00:01:16.170> x<00:01:16.729> well

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
lower than the fully fledged fury x well

lower than the fully fledged fury x well
glad<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.180> asked<00:01:18.750> many<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.530> probably<00:01:19.890> guessing

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
glad you asked many i probably guessing

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
glad you asked many i probably guessing
you<00:01:20.670> understood<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.810> already<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.439> it's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you understood this already but it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.640 
you understood this already but it's
gonna<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.100> slower<00:01:23.549> core<00:01:24.030> clock<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
gonna have a slower core clock now we

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
gonna have a slower core clock now we
don't<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> core<00:01:26.970> clock<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
don't know what this core clock is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.899 
don't know what this core clock is
actually<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.840> gonna<00:01:28.320> end<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.680> being<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.729> can

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
actually in gonna end up being we can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.130 
actually in gonna end up being we can
probably<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> rough<00:01:31.110> guess<00:01:31.140> um<00:01:32.119> by<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> by

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
probably make a rough guess um by the by

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.700 
probably make a rough guess um by the by
the<00:01:34.170> six-year<00:01:34.950> deduction<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> fact<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the six-year deduction of the fact that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
the six-year deduction of the fact that
the<00:01:40.400> GPU<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.430> supposedly<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.570> within

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the GPU is supposedly good to be within

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.130 
the GPU is supposedly good to be within
85<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.040> 90<00:01:44.430> percent<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.060> performance<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
85 to 90 percent the performance of the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
85 to 90 percent the performance of the
fury<00:01:46.439> eggs<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> other<00:01:47.640> words<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> nano<00:01:48.240> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
fury eggs so in other words the nano is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.670 
fury eggs so in other words the nano is
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> say<00:01:49.049> eighty<00:01:49.320> five<00:01:49.619> percent

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going to be that say eighty five percent

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.780 
going to be that say eighty five percent
as<00:01:50.310> fast<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.780> fury<00:01:52.140> x<00:01:52.380> which<00:01:52.649> may<00:01:53.310> give<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
as fast as the fury x which may give you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
as fast as the fury x which may give you
a<00:01:53.820> hint<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> final<00:01:55.170> performance<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
a hint to the final performance of the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.399 
a hint to the final performance of the
card<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:58.320> once<00:01:58.860> again<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.640> only<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.329> guess<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
card but once again it's only a guess it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
card but once again it's only a guess it
could<00:02:01.950> also<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.909> another<00:02:03.210> option<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
could also be what another option and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.160 
could also be what another option and
this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.350> purely<00:02:04.799> speculation<00:02:05.579> these<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this is purely speculation these the

about<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.770> fury<00:02:59.280> now<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.680> actually<00:03:01.680> think<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
about the fury now I actually think the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.960 
about the fury now I actually think the
fury<00:03:03.080> depending<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.230> end<00:03:04.620> pricing<00:03:05.490> might

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
fury depending on the end pricing might

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
fury depending on the end pricing might
be<00:03:07.220> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.460> more<00:03:08.670> interesting<00:03:09.060> card<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
be kind of the more interesting card the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.490 
be kind of the more interesting card the
reason<00:03:10.830> i<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.390> if<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
reason i think that is that if the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.120 
reason i think that is that if the
pricing<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.720> aggressive<00:03:15.720> enough<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.440> will

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
pricing is is aggressive enough it will

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.740 
pricing is is aggressive enough it will
be<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:19.730> card<00:03:20.730> which<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.120> considerably<00:03:21.690> more

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
be a card which is considerably more

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.210 
be a card which is considerably more
powerful<00:03:22.620> than<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.489> online<00:03:23.970> 290<00:03:24.540> eggs<00:03:25.220> but

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
powerful than the online 290 eggs but

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.690 
powerful than the online 290 eggs but
because<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:27.090> i<00:03:27.959> beez<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.950> basically<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
because I i beez that basically the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.210

produce their own version of the cool

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
specs with the fury eggs the reason I

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.100 
specs with the fury eggs the reason I
think<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.489> could<00:03:47.700> be<00:03:47.760> very<00:03:48.120> useful<00:03:48.209> is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
think that could be very useful is

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.070 
think that could be very useful is
because<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.790> overclock<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.690> theory

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
because if we can overclock the theory

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.710 
because if we can overclock the theory
or<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> fury<00:03:52.739> does<00:03:53.459> indeed<00:03:54.000> feature<00:03:54.360> higher

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
or the fury does indeed feature higher

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.650 
or the fury does indeed feature higher

moment<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.830> say<00:05:19.889> that<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.490> actually<00:05:20.819> really

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
moment and say that it's actually really

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.760 
moment and say that it's actually really
good<00:05:21.330> because<00:05:23.720> while<00:05:24.720> I've<00:05:24.900> said<00:05:25.139> before<00:05:25.169> and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
good because while I've said before and

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.370 
good because while I've said before and
I'll<00:05:25.889> say<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.130> again<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.479> Maxwell<00:05:27.990> lineup

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
I'll say it again the the Maxwell lineup

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.830 
I'll say it again the the Maxwell lineup
is<00:05:28.530> not<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.889> most<00:05:29.039> interesting<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.030> GPUs<00:05:30.599> I've

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
is not the most interesting of GPUs I've

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.379 
is not the most interesting of GPUs I've
got<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.349> say<00:05:31.590> that<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.949> tight<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:33.120> tie

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
got to say that the tight the the tie

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.290 
got to say that the tight the the tie
the<00:05:33.449> 980<00:05:34.110> tie<00:05:34.409> is<00:05:34.979> really<00:05:35.340> holding<00:05:35.550> its<00:05:35.880> own<00:05:36.000> at

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
the 980 tie is really holding its own at

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.420 
the 980 tie is really holding its own at
the<00:05:36.419> moment<00:05:36.449> regarding<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.380> fury<00:05:37.710> X<00:05:37.979> and<00:05:38.340> the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
the moment regarding the fury X and the

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.680 
the moment regarding the fury X and the
fury<00:05:38.669> line<00:05:38.969> up<00:05:39.509> is<00:05:40.849> gonna<00:05:41.849> really<00:05:42.150> have<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.419> do

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
fury line up is gonna really have to do

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.860 
fury line up is gonna really have to do
a<00:05:42.990> Christ's<00:05:43.710> more<00:05:43.860> than<00:05:44.159> video<00:05:44.370> because<00:05:45.210> yes

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
a Christ's more than video because yes

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.300 
a Christ's more than video because yes
you've<00:05:46.139> got<00:05:46.320> certain<00:05:46.680> games<00:05:46.860> which<00:05:47.070> are<00:05:47.159> going

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
you've got certain games which are going

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.029 
you've got certain games which are going
to<00:05:47.370> run<00:05:47.520> better<00:05:47.759> on<00:05:47.940> NVIDIA<00:05:48.930> hardware<00:05:49.469> yes

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
to run better on NVIDIA hardware yes

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.260 
to run better on NVIDIA hardware yes
you're<00:05:50.219> going<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.430> have<00:05:50.550> certain<00:05:50.789> games<00:05:51.060> which

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
you're going to have certain games which

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.420 
you're going to have certain games which
are<00:05:51.330> going<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.539> run<00:05:51.659> better<00:05:51.930> on<00:05:52.199> AMD<00:05:52.800> hardware

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
are going to run better on AMD hardware

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.149 
are going to run better on AMD hardware
but<00:05:54.000> there's<00:05:54.210> no<00:05:54.419> clear<00:05:54.750> winner<00:05:55.050> which<00:05:55.409> means

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
but there's no clear winner which means

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.939 
but there's no clear winner which means
that<00:05:56.430> really<00:05:57.150> there's<00:05:58.020> only<00:05:58.259> a<00:05:58.349> couple<00:05:58.409> of

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
that really there's only a couple of

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.059 
that really there's only a couple of
ways<00:05:59.190> that<00:05:59.330> AMD<00:06:00.330> or<00:06:00.360> Nvidia<00:06:01.139> can<00:06:01.349> entice<00:06:01.770> you

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
ways that AMD or Nvidia can entice you

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.070 
ways that AMD or Nvidia can entice you
to<00:06:02.099> buy<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.460> card<00:06:02.819> that's<00:06:03.330> just<00:06:03.630> for<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.870> sake

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
to buy a card that's just for the sake

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.409 
to buy a card that's just for the sake
of<00:06:04.110> argument<00:06:04.620> say<00:06:04.949> you've<00:06:05.130> got<00:06:05.159> a<00:06:05.490> gtx<00:06:05.969> 680

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
of argument say you've got a gtx 680

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.920 
of argument say you've got a gtx 680
right<00:06:06.960> which<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.610> reasonable<00:06:09.120> card<00:06:09.389> but

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
right which so the reasonable card but

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.209 
right which so the reasonable card but
if<00:06:10.050> you're<00:06:10.169> running<00:06:10.349> at<00:06:10.590> those<00:06:10.740> ultra<00:06:10.949> high

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
if you're running at those ultra high

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.370 
if you're running at those ultra high
resolutions<00:06:11.940> as<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:12.270> you're<00:06:12.509> you're<00:06:13.050> saying

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
resolutions as so you're you're saying

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.770 
resolutions as so you're you're saying
hmm<00:06:13.949> maybe<00:06:14.190> i<00:06:14.280> should<00:06:14.460> go<00:06:14.490> for<00:06:14.759> 4k<00:06:15.180> finally

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
hmm maybe i should go for 4k finally

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.040 
hmm maybe i should go for 4k finally
well<00:06:16.110> okay<00:06:17.330> now<00:06:18.330> you've<00:06:18.599> actually<00:06:18.719> got<00:06:19.020> a

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
well okay now you've actually got a

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.839 
well okay now you've actually got a
choice<00:06:19.440> because<00:06:20.069> you<00:06:20.219> can't<00:06:20.460> just<00:06:20.639> say<00:06:20.819> well

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
choice because you can't just say well

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.850 
choice because you can't just say well
i'm<00:06:21.240> gonna<00:06:21.389> go<00:06:21.569> with<00:06:21.599> nvidia<00:06:22.139> or<00:06:22.199> I'm<00:06:22.469> gonna<00:06:22.620> go

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.990 
clear winner between the two you know
generations<00:06:40.259> of<00:06:40.409> cards<00:06:40.919> so<00:06:41.520> this<00:06:41.789> is<00:06:41.909> actually

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
generations of cards so this is actually

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.610 
generations of cards so this is actually
going<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:42.479> be<00:06:42.569> really<00:06:42.810> good<00:06:42.960> for<00:06:43.080> vendors<00:06:43.500> it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
going to be really good for vendors it

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.350 
going to be really good for vendors it
means<00:06:43.830> that<00:06:44.099> they<00:06:44.610> have<00:06:44.639> to<00:06:44.939> compete<00:06:45.180> on
