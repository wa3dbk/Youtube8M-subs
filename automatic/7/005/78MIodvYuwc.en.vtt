00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi how about how are you and well I already 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm around back in Madrid and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.859
 nothing in this first video I'm going to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.040
 teach some shopping that I've done in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 mercadona whenever I come I think what 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.150
 What I do is go to mercadona 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 because I have to buy food too me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 I go to the cosmetic part as not and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 well first of all I'll show you two 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 makeup things that is like what 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.830
 I bought my mother because I had to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 when it came it will not be left then I sent 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.840
 my image ham with it and well she 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.880
 I bought the rouge and waterproof 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.640
 of the collection is summer of 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.980
 of those who bring three umbrellas and in 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.990
 colors resistant to water and good 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.800
 blusher is the only one there is the puts 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.110
 01 and is this pink gum 13 in pink tone 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.880
 chewing gum as such and good pigment a 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.880
 heap with very little amount 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.750
 Look, it's caught very little but you'll see 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 that with that little 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.579
 there it is blurred 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.890
 how nice is it 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.520
 and with that little bit I think we have 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.670
 for a cheek I'm going to put more 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.320
 more without blurring let's go see 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.540
 better the tone 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 there it would be without blurring and blurring 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.620
 but you can see what faded is very 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.050
 natural although it seems I know a little more 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.640
 fluorine 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.860
 and this good blusher think 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.150
 it cost against fifty or five 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 euros something like that because it's that I do not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.660
 agreement I took it from her and the shady I 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.790
 I took the tone 03 which is this brown 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.270
 because the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 the 1 and the 2 seemed to me that they seemed very 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.650
 similar to tattoo colors and had 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.240
 its colors so good I fucked myself 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.399
 I took my mother this one 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.710
 it's like that very tiny 3 only 5 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.229
 milliliters I have applied in very little 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.759
 amount you see that the granite applied 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 but you will see that with this small amount 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.060
 playing a lot 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 Look, it's a brown that's pretty bright 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.649
 it is satin 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.180
 there it looks darker and there you see more 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.160
 beige 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.570
 I do not know how much I like it, I think 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.910
 apply it by the eyelid and then 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.690
 darken the basin so for that to 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 for daily I think it's pretty 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.480
 wearable this shade color 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.320
 and well I'm going to show you purchases that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.150
 I did yesterday I 'm going to start with some 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.380
 capsules I never talk about supplements 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.330
 food or anything but good 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.100
 lately I'm right now I'm 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.260
 caring for me many ask me is that 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.810
 well I teach you I bought these tea 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.550
 green that costs at 495 and he can well 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.290
 that you take two before each meal and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.340
 well then a supplement to the diet 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:50.370
 and then these evening primrose oil these 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.110
 are two a day the evening primrose oil serves 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.360
 well I was using this already in 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.489
 Romania and well I heard that it was very 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.440
 good for the skin for the cycle 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.870
 menstrual for the pains I especially 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.150
 the use for the skin for because they said 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.769
 that the hormonal problems of the skin 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.019
 It went very well and like me the granites that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.120
 I have hormonal ones, well, for 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.950
 try to fix it say that about 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.250
 the results the three months I have 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.819
 like a month and a half and the truth is that 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.579
 I have already noticed improvement I do not know if that is 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.190
 for the care I 'm giving you because 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.180
 but I know that noticed improvement then I 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.250
 I bought a protective facial fluid 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.530
 because it 's enough for me that the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.420
 facial protector that I have seen this 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.980
 this I think it's new they put fluid 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 facial protector 50 plus 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.530
 of light texture face neck and neckline 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.440
 with vitamin e grape and uvb filters 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.180
 vb and well I took this one because 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.030
 I tried there was one for oily skin 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.880
 and another for 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.310
 more mature skins but the pillar 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.080
 fat I was only 30 then I saw this and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.910
 as I envisioned it there I saw that the texture was 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.040
 very light it did not leave me feeling greasy 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 in my hand where I tried it so good 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.200
 I decided to buy it because it only costs 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.660
 570 birds I only mean because the ones 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.850
 that I use are worth 20 euros then I said 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.459
 look I do not want to spend 20 euros on a 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.440
 fluid passes me thrown a lot with 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.579
 sting there is a white texture but it is very 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.389
 ligerita is not a pasty 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.389
 I'll put it there 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.290
 good is left and bright but absorbed 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.290
 right away 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.700
 end is already absorbed is the 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.290
 difference that was here is no longer or 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.210
 be that for oily skin I want 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.740
 go very well mixed fat skins I do not 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.510
 I want to risk saying nothing because I do not 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.010
 I 've tried it, we expect the feeling that 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.010
 it gives me is that it is nothing sticky 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.379
 the next one is this hydrating 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.150
 luminosity I had the old format 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.370
 and I do not know if it was of these that had 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.409
 carcinogenic components but they have good 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.939
 removed is now in butter format 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:05.129
 although I did like the other one more 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:12.090
 pepa full format but hey I am going to 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:15.180
 teaching brings 200 milliliters and costs 275 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.639
 Well, the protector and biz have you here 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.150
 as well and I'm going to make you a little 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.150
 sample 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.270
 well this is close I do not know if neither 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.129
 in the cream does not seem to have 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.090
 luminosity when we see it in the boat 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.090
 but then when applying them 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.429
 It smells very good 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.990
 similar to the olive reminds me of a 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:42.990
 little to see if you can 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.020
 you see a little the luminosity 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.360
 I do not know is that to see if you can compare it 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.740
 with 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.620
 this one that leads and here that takes us 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.780
 you see there I want to see the best 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.550
 luminosity that gives good I do not know this for 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.020
 the legs with we are so more die and 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.569
 you're in summer I think it's 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.210
 great, it's also quite moisturizing, 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.039
 it's just the light effect it gives but that 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.590
 it also comes in handy to moisturize so 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.540
 and it's very cheap so I think it's going 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.320
 cool 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.500
 that more things like this had seen this spray 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.630
 solar conditioner for hair that is 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.250
 who they have now brought new and good I 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.290
 I have always used these conditioners 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.050
 biphasic of mercadona for the beach 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.850
 to help me unravel to have the 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.260
 hair softer and good because this year has 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.730
 exploited that you have taken this 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.500
 special for the sun and well what 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:44.010
 I'll use for that and this had a price of 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.860
 195 and good finally nothing typical 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.840
 of him and you are I have replaced those of 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.120
 Honey Cookies 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.830
 how good is there with the bag open 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.060
 final I expected 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.520
 what smells great alone is worth one euro 25 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.050
 each package and new mint and 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.220

 willem after is total and good as they are 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.110
 very cheap and 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.700
 and nothing to follow that is a bit 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.800

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.550
