00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.429
 hello how fast I wanted them 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.500
 share before starting this enamel 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.539
 that I bring positions of the brand or soldier 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.970
 they look how beautiful the bottles 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.519
 packaging and the colors are 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.289
 beautiful this color is called albert and 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.810
 down there they are link where they can 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.640
 buy be pending because I'm 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.439
 doing a review of all the colors 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.980
 that carries this line so they are 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.980
 slopes 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 although I will start by showing you the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 types of gels that can be used with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 tell official show this I bought it in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.960
 ebay for two dollars this is from in this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.780
 it was a gift this this is from haiti what 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.230
 can buy in any supply I think 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.110
 who sell it 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.640
 with darlings are glasses and here the nails 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.430
 are already prepared this is the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.410
 easy flow dehydrator apply it and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.140
 Now I'm going to apply a capita of first 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.500
 this prime is from lady which is very good 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.479
 I like to try different brands is les 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.960
 I advise never to stay alone with one 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.040
 brand there are enough good products 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.940
 outside so you have to try different 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.700
 and so we know what works for us 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.410
 I'm not using this brush for the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 number 4 and this gel is the show loaded 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.830
 and I wanted to try it out but 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.479
 any software I promise you that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.550
 it will give you the same result 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.789
 matter what brand it is with that it be soft 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.729
 we are going to put a capita of the gaditano 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.130
 so thin but thin what happened 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.160
 enough that it's not too 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.990
 The job is fine, even if it is 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.090
 that the balance is going to be put 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.150
 after very close nothing more assured 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.790
 they exceed not touching 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.380
 do not touch cuticle because we do not want is 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.020
 the same effect that we do not want 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.600
 lift up here I'm using clickers one 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.120
 is key in clan thembu let's the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.440
 color that of sawyer and these two are from 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.910
 organic theme in sant and in shadow 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.130
 I have this wipe are my wipes 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.830
 I already reviewed this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.380
 mark the truth that I recommend them 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.620
 100% these wipes are 100% lint free 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.230
 they do not leave any lint and they are worth it 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.780
 what you invest because it is very 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.290
 diverse 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.760
 down in the description box 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.560
 I 'll leave the link where 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.030
 can buy the balls and where 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.610
 can buy the enamels who in the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.640
 this as they see nothing more with a pusher 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.690
 cuticle I put the killer is very easy 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.090
 and fast this process and this and nothing else 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.130
 making sure there are no spaces 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.410
 English does not matter that I touch skin 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.660
 because the clergy nothing else is going to stick to 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.970
 where we put the gel so that's why 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.130
 I say be careful not to touch the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.900
 skin now I will use the color only 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.790
 and how do you see the wipes too 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.239
 they served to put back the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.610
 clicker and do not waste the truth like 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.550
 they saw there after putting it hit him at 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.310
 finger a little bit so that everything falls 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.370
 the clergy that is there of excess 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.760
 Now I'm going to do one more 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.790
 and there I pick up the same wipes 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.360
 parts and you're that I see that they do not have 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.610
 have to cover it very well and give it that 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.650
 tap to bring everyone and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.200
 there is showing you that it looks like 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.099
 that and on the skin but since it does not have gel 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.659
 It is not going to stick since it is lamp 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.879
 now this last one of what I'm going to use the 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.069
 diary declared in google is holographic 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.890
 I recommend that for this one jaume ni 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.930
 that use metallic utilities or clickers 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.450
 holographic the clippers and ree 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.030
 students are going to look very translucent 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.680
 so I do not have to put that much 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.170
 I recommend the metal ones or just 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.620
 graphics as well as you see is already ready and 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.709
 we put a lamp 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.709
 and 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.550
 since we take our hand out of the lamp 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.150
 I have this broach that came in a kit 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.140
 I bought from freehand brushes 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.590
 is perfect can use any 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.360
 brush that has dry hairs like 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.570
 come look at everything that was on the skin 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.560
 it took off perfectly now we're going to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.940
 put another layer of souza faria or as 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 come there when I'm on the cuticle 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.530
 I'm careful to seal is the same as 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.080
 when we apply the acrylic do not touch 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.670
 skin and at the end also seal to the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.370
 little bank of the 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.220
 we have to cover very well all of it 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.140
 claire the layer has to be thin what 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.140
 enough to not be too 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.570
 thick but thick enough to 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.080
 that the texture of the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.910
 balance ok yes if you put it to the lamp 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.100
 and still feel the texture of 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.160
 balance can put another capita 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.680
 Soca cold but in my case this layer was 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.100
 enough now since I do all I put 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.100
 to throw 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.820
 because we already take the hand out of the lamp 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.250
 after two minutes this since 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.190
 encapsulate mos with the gel let's say it 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.190
 well the show coffee already leaves a capita 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.110
 sticky that is removed with alcohol the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.110
 I use alcohol is 70 percent and 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.940
 here with my favorite wipes I'm going to 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.470
 remove that residue that leaves the shock already 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.380
 this we are going to clean very well and 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.320
 are ready to put the gel from 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.520
 over I'm using you'll be shine 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.130
 of the nova brand and we're going to put a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.220
 capita and as you see is the final touch and 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.070
 that give these nails that give shine and if 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.240
 more I tell them that the model that I am 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.250
 using here is my sister and they lasted 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.449
 well at three weeks I already wanted 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.729
 change but 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.460
 It had been three weeks since 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.710
 they had lifted nothing shined beautiful 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.629
 so they can use any color 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.939
