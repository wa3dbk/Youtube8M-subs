00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.400
 Ladies and Gentlemen 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.100
 Hey guys ~ ~ Hey girls 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.390
 I would like to introduce you to Jewelry! They are ready? 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
 How much do you love me? How much do you love me? 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 Do not be shy, at this moment ... 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.100
 Try to seduce me, try to make me love you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.300
 So I'm going to fall in love with you 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.000
 Even if everyone says that you are the best 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.800
 Saying that I just need to go to you, yes 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.300
 But with another drink, your obvious style 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.600
 You lost something 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 Let's go girls 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.700
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh baby) 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh oh oh) 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.900
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh baby) 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (Hey!) 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.800
 I know you want to show off, I also know how you feel 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.900
 I buy another drink, I'm going to drink it all, It falls for me 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.500
 Every time you feel lonely and need someone to celebrate oh! please 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.000
 Call me baby, I'll be there quickly 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.400
 Pretending you can not win, holding my hand 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.200
 Thus, we will cling strongly to each other 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.700
 Look in the mirror once more 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.000
 My wardrobe and makeup key (Czech!) 

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.900
 I want to keep falling for you, on my way to the rhythm 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.400
 Because I am a respawn, resilient, resilient, man! 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.910
 How much do you love me? How much do you love me? 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.510
 I know you've fallen in love right now 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.110
 Begging, asking 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.310
 it's obvious and I'm getting tired of this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010
 In fact, everyone knows 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.810
 The gossip everyone knows but they let it go 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.800
 What do you say every day if you regret losing someone? 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.400
 Tell me you love me too, Tell me baby! 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.110
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh baby) 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.010
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh oh oh) 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.310
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh baby) 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.010
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (Hey!) 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.200
 I know you want to show off, I also know how you feel You want this to be obvious, sometimes I also know what it feels like 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.600
 But I buy another drink, I'm going to drink it all 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.300
 It falls for me, for me 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.300
 If you're thinking about having me if you love me, you need to hurry a bit 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.200
 Hold it, hold it, hold it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.800
 Hold it, hold it, hold it 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.100
 I'm so tired of the obvious signs 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.300
 Now please! Please! Please! 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.300

 Here and there they want me 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.000
 Among them you too, you wait for me (oh oh oh) 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 Bring your friends, keep it well 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.300
 Steal my heart by touching what's under my nose 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.700
 If you wish, you can have it 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.500
 You have the charms to do it 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.900
 Boy, boy, boy 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.200
 Everyone says 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.410
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (oh baby) 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.310

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.310
 Hold it, reshape it, hold it (Hey!) 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.500
 I know you want to show off, I also know how you feel You want this to be obvious, sometimes I also know what it feels like 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.900
 But I buy another drink, I'm going to drink it all 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.600
 It falls for me, for me 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.700
 Should I lean on your shoulder? 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.200
 Should I whisper it to you? 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.800
 Should I flirt for you? 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.100
 If you love me, if you want me, try to fall for me
