00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 - Jane, is that you? - Yeah. 

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:03.800
 DRESSES ARE PERFECT 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.000
 - You look beautiful. - Do you really think so? 

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.800
 As if they were made for you. 

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.800
 DORT IS AMAZING 

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.500
 Great, it's amazing. 

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.700
 THE WHOLE WEDDING IS ADDRESSED 

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.000
 IT IS ONE ONE PROBLEM 9 00: 00: 16,201 -&gt; 00: 00: 17,000 It's the bride. 

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:18.800
 She's just a chopper 11 00: 00: 19,001 -&gt; 00: 00: 20,500 Okay, everybody ready? 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.800
 Now be careful. You know your name? 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.000
 - I do not. - I'm Kevin. 

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:28.000
 Hey hey hey, okay, we'll get you a cab. 

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.600
 But a really beautiful wedding. 

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:33.000
 Don't you think it's just a ritual, something like catching a guy before he does another? 

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.000
 Oh, how refreshing. Another guy who doesn't believe in a wedding. 

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.000
 Jane was great at taking care of everyone around. 

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.000
 You were a bridesmaid twenty-two times? 

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:43.000
 So besides working, you help people get married. 

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.800
 - Are you having fun? - Yeah, it's a great party. 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.800
 But she never cared for herself. 

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.000
 Jane, did you put that big sandwich on my desk? 

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:51.800
 - I thought you'd be hungry. - I love you for that. 

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.200
 I love you too. 

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.000
 Yeah, you're right, I needed it. 

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:56.400
 George appreciates me. 

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.800
 And what is it when you have nothing to do with it? 

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.000
 Go to him and tell him what you feel. Now, go. 

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.800
 George, this is my sister Tess. Tess, this is my George. 

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.200
 No, I didn't mean to say that. 

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.000
 - Would you like a drink? - Definitely. 

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.700
 Congratulations. 

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:20.700
 Now... 

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.000
 Twenty-seven dresses. 

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.600
 It will sound strange, but I really enjoyed it a few times in the dress. 

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.600
 ... a woman all her life ... 

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.800
 - In three weeks, we'll get married! - In three weeks? 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.400
 He wants me to arrange everything. 

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.000
 ... made other people happy ... 

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:34.500
 - You were in the shop and ordered flowers? - Yeah. 

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.000
 You can't plan your sister's wedding with the man you love. 

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.800
 It's crazy. I'll kick her ... 

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.000
 ... will appear ... 

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.600
 You've already arranged it for a lot of people. 

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.800
 A lot of people, but never in such a situation. Not even once. 

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.800
 ... how to do the same for yourself. 

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.800
 You better focus on getting others to have nice memories of yours. 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.400
 FROM THE SCENARIOS OF THE FILM THE DEVIL WILL PRAGUE 

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:56.200
 You can start over. Say no and do what you want. What do you want, Jane? 

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.200
 KATHERINE HEIGL from the movie Knocked Up 

00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:02.000
 I don't understand what you don't like about him. Sparkling blue eyes, a beautiful smile. 

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:03.000
 JAMES MARSDEN 

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:07.000
 You can't deny that this whole cynical thing is because you didn't find the right one. 

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.000
 - Beautiful. - You said handsome? 

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.000
 27 DRESSES 

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:15.000
 It must be hard to see your younger sister getting married to you. 

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.000
 Yes. 

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.800
 But then I remember that I still have hot sex with strangers ... 

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.000
 ... and I'm so much better. ------------------------------ 339c1e3f744c--
