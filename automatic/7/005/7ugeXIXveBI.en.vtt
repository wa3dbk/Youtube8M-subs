00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
for eggs and was a bad idea they kind of

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.630 
for eggs and was a bad idea they kind of
got<00:03:12.610> destroyed<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:15.420> my<00:03:16.420> lessons<00:03:17.550> then<00:03:18.550> what

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
got destroyed but my lessons then what

you do is you stick the sides off you
just<00:03:21.340> kind<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:25.120> work<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.450> into<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:26.010> circle

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
just kind of just work it into a circle

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.949 
just kind of just work it into a circle
and<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.220> run<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.060> down<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:28.480> happens<00:03:28.810> is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
and you run it down and what happens is

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.979 
and you run it down and what happens is
it<00:03:29.140> kind<00:03:29.319> of<00:03:30.150> meshes<00:03:31.150> together<00:03:31.300> at<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.690> bottom

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it kind of meshes together at the bottom

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.630 
it kind of meshes together at the bottom
there<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.290> can<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.680> hide<00:03:33.250> your<00:03:33.430> thread

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640
