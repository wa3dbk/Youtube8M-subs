00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
but one thing Marianne feels strongly

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.150 
but one thing Marianne feels strongly
about<00:00:19.070> is<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.490> need<00:00:19.730> for<00:00:19.789> us<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:20.420> really<00:00:20.869> take

about is the need for us to really take
responsibility<00:00:22.160> for<00:00:22.190> ourselves<00:00:22.750> yes<00:00:24.369> it's

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
responsibility for ourselves yes it's

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.450 
responsibility for ourselves yes it's
very<00:00:25.640> tempting<00:00:25.970> sometimes<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:27.279> explain<00:00:28.279> away

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
very tempting sometimes to explain away

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.730 
very tempting sometimes to explain away
every<00:00:29.300> weakness<00:00:29.749> you<00:00:29.960> know<00:00:29.990> I'm<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.560> way

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
every weakness you know I'm that way

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.370 
every weakness you know I'm that way
because<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.460> my<00:00:31.580> mother<00:00:32.390> I'm<00:00:32.810> that<00:00:33.140> way

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
because of my mother I'm that way

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.770 
because of my mother I'm that way
because<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:33.980> my<00:00:34.130> father<00:00:34.460> I'm<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:35.540> way

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
because of my father I'm this way

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.480 
because of my father I'm this way
because<00:00:36.140> of<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.290> someone<00:00:36.740> did<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:37.070> me<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.340> I

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
because of what someone did to me and I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.150 
because of what someone did to me and I
I<00:00:38.050> think<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:39.140> worth<00:00:39.320> remembering<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.010> know

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
I think it's worth remembering you know

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.220 
I think it's worth remembering you know
no<00:00:40.610> matter<00:00:40.820> where<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.149> got<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.539> issue<00:00:41.660> it's

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
no matter where you got the issue it's

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.380 
no matter where you got the issue it's
yours<00:00:42.559> now<00:00:42.770> you're<00:00:43.280> responsible<00:00:43.969> for<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.239> now

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
yours now you're responsible for it now

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.900 
yours now you're responsible for it now
maybe<00:00:45.109> when<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.440> were<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.559> child<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.670> could<00:00:46.789> be

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
maybe when you were a child it could be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.459 
maybe when you were a child it could be
argued<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.420> were<00:00:47.539> a<00:00:47.570> victim<00:00:47.750> but<00:00:48.260> not

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
argued that you were a victim but not

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.430 
argued that you were a victim but not
now<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:49.910> yours<00:00:50.329> to<00:00:50.600> either<00:00:50.809> transform

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
now now it's yours to either transform

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.759 
now now it's yours to either transform
or<00:00:51.620> not<00:00:51.769> it's<00:00:52.370> yours<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:53.000> either<00:00:53.239> heal<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:54.379> not

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
or not it's yours to either heal or not

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.740 
or not it's yours to either heal or not
so<00:00:55.609> I<00:00:55.940> think<00:00:56.030> sometimes<00:00:57.129> we<00:00:58.750> confuse

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
so I think sometimes we confuse

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.549 
so I think sometimes we confuse
compassion<00:01:00.530> with<00:01:00.769> coddling<00:01:02.289> compassion<00:01:03.289> for

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
compassion with coddling compassion for

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.680 
compassion with coddling compassion for
each<00:01:03.710> other's<00:01:04.010> pain<00:01:04.309> yes<00:01:04.820> bearing<00:01:05.210> witness<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
each other's pain yes bearing witness to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.720 
each other's pain yes bearing witness to
each<00:01:05.810> other's<00:01:06.080> agony<00:01:06.560> yes<00:01:08.140> coddling<00:01:09.140> and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
each other's agony yes coddling and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.400 
each other's agony yes coddling and
supporting<00:01:10.730> each<00:01:10.850> other<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.300> staying<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:12.050> the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
supporting each other and staying in the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.720 
supporting each other and staying in the
problem<00:01:12.800> rather<00:01:12.920> than<00:01:13.100> getting<00:01:13.340> into<00:01:13.550> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.350 
problem rather than getting into the
solution

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360
