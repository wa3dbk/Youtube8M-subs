00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the best part of the circuit I like more

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.890 
the best part of the circuit I like more
the<00:00:39.300> fast<00:00:39.809> corners<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.700> bank<00:00:41.700> corners<00:00:42.180> but

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
the fast corners in the bank corners but

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.380 
the fast corners in the bank corners but
anyway<00:00:43.290> after<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.220> go<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.820> power<00:00:45.060> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
anyway after we go through the power the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.490 
anyway after we go through the power the
park<00:00:45.740> park<00:00:46.740> situation<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> beginning<00:00:47.940> we

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
park park situation in the beginning we

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.980 
park park situation in the beginning we
we<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.980> next<00:00:50.130> sector<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.780> it's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
we go to the next sector to where it's

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.180 
we go to the next sector to where it's
definitely<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.980> lot<00:00:53.910> faster<00:00:54.710> going<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.860> ruse

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
definitely a lot faster going into ruse

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.120 
definitely a lot faster going into ruse
can<00:00:56.400> hope<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> explain<00:00:57.300> probably<00:00:57.900> better

back to fifth gear for the right corner

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.980 
back to fifth gear for the right corner
for<00:01:08.070> gear<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.579> left<00:01:08.939> corner<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.689> two

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
for gear for the left corner so it's two

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
for gear for the left corner so it's two
really<00:01:10.320> fast<00:01:10.560> color<00:01:10.829> you<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.689> down
