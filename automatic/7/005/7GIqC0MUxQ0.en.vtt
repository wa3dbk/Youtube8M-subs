00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.900
 we all have a vocation in the vocation 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.610
 your origin of your word means 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 you call means the calling 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.099
 so we all have sometime 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.129
 of our present life a called the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.949
 called to exercise something that our 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.440
 soul is identified 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.260
 many times we have a call 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.330
 to be therapists and what are the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 characteristics of the one I was born to 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.309
 be a therapist 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 first he can listen to your neighbor 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.430
 he listens attentively and in the middle of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.219
 it identifies where he is. 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 repeating errors and mistakes so 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.790
 that can contribute to that person if 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.840
 make a better person 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 he has patience he has intolerance 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.259
 then this feeling of non-judgment 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 by your neighbor that empathy that 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.750
 provoked by the person she is born together 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.509
 with us then at the moment that we 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.479
 we often feel this calling 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.789
 we are always working in the field of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 holistic therapy many times 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.520
 we are acting in any other area 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.789
 but suddenly this call comes to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 She screams and asks us to 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:44.550
 so let us assume at that moment if 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 makes it a big challenge for you to start 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.610
 search courses in lectures 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 even within the therapy itself 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.090
 elements so that you can get 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.209
 to become a professional with excellence 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 therefore being holistic therapist he 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.899
 born of a need a will 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.020
 make a difference the will to do 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.970
 difference is born from what we 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.120
 we bring along with us and that not always 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.580
 here then these features I 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.069
 Earring that comes from factory backup them 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.159
 are essential for a therapist 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.140
 follow this walk where it goes 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.480
 perfecting and conquering 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.540
 excellence 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.610
 remember 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.480
 one won from excellence 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.840
 10 thousand hours of focus on something so 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.609
 10 thousand hours of service is leaving 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.060
 from this moment in which we have become a 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.370
 therapist with excellence 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.250
 so it's no use walking you through 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.069
 this path if there is no such call 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.040
 if there were no predispositions in 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.470
 to be a good therapist. 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.819
 serve for your neighbor 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.379
 when you decide to be a therapist 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.889

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.349
 role of holistic therapist 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.269
 understand that there is a need for 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.680
 to help your neighbor 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.409
 keeps forgetting about himself therefore in the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.500
 life of a holistic therapist he is a 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.760
 great challenge is a great challenge because 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.739
 align vocation to mission without forgetting that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.250
 we are human beings we need 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.049

 it is essential that our language be 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.579

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.310
 science with spirituality with feet 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.250
 our way of expressing 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.250

 most of the time we are therapists 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.229
 informal 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.780
