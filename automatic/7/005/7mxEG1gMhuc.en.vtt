00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.859
 in the case here but in spark 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 do not want to catch have you failing 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.560
 probably should if the coil is good for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 you change only the bad key besides 4 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.809
 universal pliers or pliers 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.579

 a key 8 but can be one of those 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.050
 something just to build strength just to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 use of support will vim turn towards 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.590
 anti-clock bolt entire property
