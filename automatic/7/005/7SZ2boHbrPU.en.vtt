00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
this is an engine out of a 1997 Jeep TJ

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.370 
this is an engine out of a 1997 Jeep TJ
I'm<00:00:12.549> going<00:00:12.969> to<00:00:13.059> give<00:00:13.299> you<00:00:13.420> a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
actual video in terms of how to install

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.560 
actual video in terms of how to install
the<00:00:17.990> distributor<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.610> first<00:00:20.240> thing<00:00:20.420> that

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
the distributor so the first thing that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.850 
the distributor so the first thing that
you<00:00:20.660> need<00:00:20.780> to<00:00:20.930> do<00:00:21.050> is<00:00:21.170> you<00:00:21.290> need<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.560> get<00:00:21.710> your

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
you need to do is you need to get your

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.280 
you need to do is you need to get your
timing<00:00:22.100> mark<00:00:22.400> lined<00:00:22.640> up<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:23.000> zero<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:23.869> if<00:00:24.140> you

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
timing mark lined up to zero so if you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.350 
timing mark lined up to zero so if you
look<00:00:24.500> at<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.010> pulley<00:00:25.279> on<00:00:25.610> the<00:00:25.670> very<00:00:26.029> front<00:00:26.300> of

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
look at the pulley on the very front of

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.900 
look at the pulley on the very front of
the<00:00:26.420> engine<00:00:27.700> try<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.760> highlight<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.270> point<00:00:29.890> and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
the engine try to highlight a point and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.010 
the engine try to highlight a point and
there's<00:00:31.910> also<00:00:32.060> one<00:00:32.360> on<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.599> other<00:00:32.720> side<00:00:32.989> that

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
there's also one on the other side that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.690 
there's also one on the other side that
I<00:00:33.230> highlighted<00:00:33.950> in<00:00:34.040> white<00:00:34.070> I<00:00:34.370> just<00:00:34.550> use<00:00:34.670> a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
I highlighted in white I just use a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.850 
I highlighted in white I just use a
piece<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.090> chalk<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.989> also<00:00:36.200> tried<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.530> mark

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
piece of chalk and I also tried to mark

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.510 
piece of chalk and I also tried to mark
zero<00:00:37.579> on<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.030> actual<00:00:38.360> mark<00:00:38.630> on<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.079> actual

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
zero on the actual mark on the actual

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.460 
zero on the actual mark on the actual
engine<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.899> idea<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:42.260> want<00:00:42.290> to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
engine and so the idea is you want to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.130 
engine and so the idea is you want to
mark<00:00:42.710> up<00:00:42.860> want<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.340> line<00:00:43.489> up<00:00:43.520> these<00:00:44.300> marks<00:00:44.630> so

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
mark up want to line up these marks so

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.380 
mark up want to line up these marks so
that<00:00:45.170> everything<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.890> lined<00:00:46.220> up<00:00:46.370> at<00:00:46.489> zero<00:00:46.760> but

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
that everything is lined up at zero but

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.450 
that everything is lined up at zero but
you<00:00:47.540> need<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.840> do<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:48.200> when<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.950> engine<00:00:49.310> is

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
you need to do that when the engine is

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.240 
you need to do that when the engine is
firing<00:00:50.150> on<00:00:50.480> number<00:00:50.810> one<00:00:50.990> cylinder<00:00:51.410> there<00:00:52.130> are

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
firing on number one cylinder there are

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.530 
firing on number one cylinder there are
some<00:00:52.370> other<00:00:52.520> if<00:00:52.760> your<00:00:52.970> engines<00:00:53.390> been

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
some other if your engines been

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.900 
some other if your engines been
disturbed<00:00:53.990> after<00:00:54.230> you've<00:00:54.650> had<00:00:54.800> your

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
disturbed after you've had your

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.090 
disturbed after you've had your
distributor<00:00:55.910> removed<00:00:56.330> you<00:00:57.020> will<00:00:57.710> want<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:57.980> do

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
distributor removed you will want to do

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.220 
distributor removed you will want to do
a<00:00:58.130> search<00:00:58.430> for<00:00:59.300> some<00:00:59.450> other<00:00:59.570> google<00:00:59.960> videos

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
a search for some other google videos

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.070 
a search for some other google videos
that<00:01:00.440> explain<00:01:00.770> how<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.040> determine<00:01:01.390> when<00:01:02.390> you

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
that explain how to determine when you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.609 
that explain how to determine when you
are<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.470> top<00:01:03.680> dead<00:01:03.950> center<00:01:05.080> firing<00:01:06.080> stroke<00:01:06.350> for

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
are on top dead center firing stroke for

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.440 
are on top dead center firing stroke for
cylinder<00:01:06.979> number<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:11.030> once<00:01:11.210> everything

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
cylinder number one so once everything

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.140 
cylinder number one so once everything
is<00:01:11.570> lined<00:01:11.900> up<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.170> top<00:01:12.380> dead<00:01:12.619> center<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.159> you've

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
is lined up a top dead center and you've

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.380 
is lined up a top dead center and you've
and<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.170> know<00:01:15.320> you're<00:01:15.560> on<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.159> firing<00:01:17.000> for

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and you know you're on the firing for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.450 
and you know you're on the firing for
number<00:01:17.659> one<00:01:17.810> cylinder<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.159> where<00:01:19.340> you

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
number one cylinder this is where you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.099 
number one cylinder this is where you
start<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:20.270> your<00:01:20.420> distributor<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.049> the

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
start to have your distributor and the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.649 
start to have your distributor and the
distributor<00:01:21.710> has<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:23.090> bunch<00:01:23.299> of<00:01:23.390> little<00:01:23.509> holes

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
distributor has a bunch of little holes

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.330 
distributor has a bunch of little holes
in<00:01:24.109> it<00:01:24.229> these<00:01:25.130> holes<00:01:25.399> are<00:01:25.729> 3/16<00:01:26.539> of<00:01:26.630> an<00:01:26.719> inch<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
in it these holes are 3/16 of an inch I

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.219 
in it these holes are 3/16 of an inch I
just<00:01:28.340> used<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.850> drill<00:01:29.149> bit<00:01:29.299> wrap<00:01:29.810> some<00:01:30.079> tape

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
just used a drill bit wrap some tape

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.499 
just used a drill bit wrap some tape
around<00:01:30.499> it<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.859> 3/16<00:01:31.609> inch<00:01:31.759> drill<00:01:31.969> bit<00:01:32.030> drop

around it a 3/16 inch drill bit drop
some<00:01:32.719> tape<00:01:32.869> around<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:34.399> actually<00:01:34.549> can

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
some tape around it and you actually can

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.270 
some tape around it and you actually can
slide<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.179> in<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.389> hole<00:01:35.889> and<00:01:36.889> make<00:01:37.009> sure<00:01:37.130> you

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
slide it in the hole and make sure you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.550 
slide it in the hole and make sure you
use<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.819> right<00:01:37.969> hole<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:38.409> then<00:01:39.409> that

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
use the right hole and then that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.039 
use the right hole and then that
actually<00:01:39.710> locks<00:01:40.039> it<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.399> place<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.899> will

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
actually locks it in place so this will

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.300 
actually locks it in place so this will
assist<00:01:42.289> you<00:01:42.499> in<00:01:42.560> making<00:01:42.889> sure<00:01:42.950> everything

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
assist you in making sure everything

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.249 
assist you in making sure everything
lines<00:01:43.429> up<00:01:43.670> when<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.149> do<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> install<00:01:44.749> of<00:01:45.139> the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
lines up when you do the install of the

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.510 
lines up when you do the install of the
distributor<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.380> next<00:01:48.590> step<00:01:48.889> once<00:01:49.429> you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.029 
slot I'm try my best here to get it get
an<00:01:59.569> angle<00:01:59.869> but<00:01:59.990> if<00:02:00.139> you<00:02:00.259> look<00:02:00.499> you<00:02:00.709> can<00:02:00.829> see

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
an angle but if you look you can see

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.769 
an angle but if you look you can see
that<00:02:01.249> it's<00:02:01.399> not<00:02:01.579> quite<00:02:01.880> at<00:02:02.029> nine<00:02:02.209> degrees<00:02:02.389> and

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
that it's not quite at nine degrees and

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.050 
that it's not quite at nine degrees and
it's<00:02:02.899> not<00:02:03.049> quite<00:02:03.289> at<00:02:03.499> 10<00:02:03.770> degrees<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.700> kind

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's not quite at 10 degrees it's kind

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.749 
it's not quite at 10 degrees it's kind
of<00:02:05.179> between<00:02:05.889> it's<00:02:06.889> like<00:02:07.130> nine<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.609> half

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
of between it's like nine and a half

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.969 
of between it's like nine and a half
degrees<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.140> we're<00:02:09.380> using

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
degrees and you can see that we're using

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.270 
degrees and you can see that we're using
that<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.399> 9<00:02:10.700> degrees<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.690> top<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.500> 12<00:02:12.920> degrees

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that as 9 degrees the top as 12 degrees

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.040 
that as 9 degrees the top as 12 degrees
it's<00:02:13.880> kind<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.270> right<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.660> range<00:02:14.930> right

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
it's kind of right in this range right

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's kind of right in this range right
in<00:02:15.290> between<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.150> that's<00:02:17.360> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.780> what

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
in between here so that's kind of what

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.270 
in between here so that's kind of what
I've<00:02:18.050> done<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.440> order<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.830> line<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I've done in order to line up the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.330 
I've done in order to line up the
distributor<00:02:19.880> or<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.420> oil<00:02:20.690> pump<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.220> when

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
distributor or the oil pump so that when

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.410 
distributor or the oil pump so that when
you<00:02:22.430> slide<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.700> distributor<00:02:23.240> into

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
you slide the distributor into

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
you slide the distributor into
everything<00:02:23.690> pops<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.710> whole<00:02:24.890> idea<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
everything pops in the whole idea is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.530 
everything pops in the whole idea is
when<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.400> slide<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> distributor<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
when you slide in the distributor you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.880 
when you slide in the distributor you
want<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.470> little

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
want that little

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.830 
want that little
grew<00:02:28.040> whole<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.940> irate<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
grew whole to be irate in the very

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.500 
grew whole to be irate in the very
center<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.590> teeth<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.970> distributor

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
center of the teeth of the distributor

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.380 
center of the teeth of the distributor
and<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:34.160> would<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:37.730> here<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.330> is

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and that would be right here so this is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.300 
and that would be right here so this is
the<00:02:38.660> distributor<00:02:39.140> where<00:02:39.319> you've<00:02:39.770> put<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.100> pin

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the distributor where you've put the pin

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.070 
the distributor where you've put the pin
in<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.610> then<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.270> have<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.540> little<00:02:41.750> slot

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
in and then you have this little slot

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.970 
in and then you have this little slot
the<00:02:42.830> center<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.520> slot<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.840> where<00:02:45.800> you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the center of that slot is where you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.470 
the center of that slot is where you
want<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.820> center<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.690> hole<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:52.480> if

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
want in the center of that hole so if

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.300 
want in the center of that hole so if
for<00:02:53.660> some<00:02:53.720> reason<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.470> distributor<00:02:54.980> does<00:02:55.160> not

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
for some reason the distributor does not

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.449 
for some reason the distributor does not
line<00:02:55.580> up<00:02:55.900> or<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.020> oil<00:02:57.470> pump<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.830> slot<00:02:58.100> does<00:02:58.280> not

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
line up or the oil pump a slot does not

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.790 
line up or the oil pump a slot does not
line<00:02:58.670> up<00:02:58.819> that's<00:02:58.970> where<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.330> just<00:02:59.360> use<00:02:59.750> a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
line up that's where you just use a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.860 
line up that's where you just use a
flathead<00:03:00.800> screwdriver<00:03:01.480> put<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.570> down<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
flathead screwdriver put it down the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.080 
flathead screwdriver put it down the
hole<00:03:03.050> get<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.860> slot<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.520> just<00:03:04.670> rotate

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
hole get in the slot and you just rotate

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.270 
hole get in the slot and you just rotate
slightly<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.350> order<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.769> line<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.100> back<00:03:07.220> up

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
slightly in order to line it back up

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.790 
slightly in order to line it back up
like<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.360> said<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:09.050> don't<00:03:09.140> want<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.410> Medina

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
like I said you don't want a Medina

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.100 
like I said you don't want a Medina

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
distributor here's just another quick

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.300 
distributor here's just another quick
shot<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.239> where<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.500> slot<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.709> for<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> oil

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
shot of where the slot is for the oil

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.720 
shot of where the slot is for the oil
pump<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.620> now<00:03:27.620> I'm<00:03:27.739> going<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.130> grab<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
pump and now I'm going to grab the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.140 
pump and now I'm going to grab the
distributor<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.220> distributor<00:03:31.700> still<00:03:31.940> has

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
distributor so the distributor still has

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.640 
distributor so the distributor still has
that<00:03:33.100> locking<00:03:34.100> pin<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:35.079> hold<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.170> distributor

that little notch sitting at
approximately<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.380> one<00:03:42.560> o'clock<00:03:42.769> position

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
approximately the one o'clock position

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.110 
approximately the one o'clock position
you<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.370> put<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.610> will<00:03:49.700> mess<00:03:50.000> up

you just I put it in and it will mess up
the<00:03:50.329> gears<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.930> will<00:03:51.049> drop<00:03:51.230> down<00:03:51.670> if

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
the gears and that will drop down if

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.920 
the gears and that will drop down if
things<00:03:53.060> are<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.360> right<00:03:53.510> place<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:55.549> will

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
the distributor is all the way down so

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.900 
the distributor is all the way down so
that<00:04:06.920> tells<00:04:07.160> me<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.370> I've<00:04:07.610> got<00:04:07.790> the

that tells me that I've got the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.789 
that tells me that I've got the
distributor<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.450> right<00:04:08.600> place<00:04:08.840> another

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
distributor in the right place another

thing too is if you look at the top a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.170 
thing too is if you look at the top a
distributor<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.230> has<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> notch<00:04:12.970> towards<00:04:13.970> the

distributor it has a notch towards the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.960 
distributor it has a notch towards the
back<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.690> engine<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.680> notch<00:04:15.920> looks<00:04:16.700> is

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
back of the engine that notch looks is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.810 
back of the engine that notch looks is
lined<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.450> with<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:19.370> notch<00:04:19.579> is<00:04:19.609> lined

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820

up correctly for number one firing

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.830 
up correctly for number one firing
position<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:28.010> this<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.479> now<00:04:29.600> I'm<00:04:29.690> going

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
position so this is in so now I'm going

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.570 
position so this is in so now I'm going

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
keep the distributor centered over top

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.300 
keep the distributor centered over top
where<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.640> bolt<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.150> clamp<00:04:35.390> goes<00:04:36.310> and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
where that bolt and the clamp goes and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.870 
where that bolt and the clamp goes and
I'm<00:04:37.460> going<00:04:37.640> to

I have also verified that the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.629 
I have also verified that the
distributor<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.930> fully<00:05:02.230> down<00:05:02.590> it's<00:05:03.010> sitting

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
distributor is fully down it's sitting

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.100 
distributor is fully down it's sitting
right<00:05:03.669> on<00:05:03.820> top<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.419> engine<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:04.960> know

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
right on top of the engine so I know

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.190 
right on top of the engine so I know
that<00:05:05.200> that's<00:05:05.500> in<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:06.010> also<00:05:06.940> still<00:05:07.600> have<00:05:07.780> my<00:05:07.960> pin

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
that that's in I also still have my pin

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.080 
that that's in I also still have my pin
in<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:10.540> it's<00:05:10.900> secure<00:05:11.560> now<00:05:11.740> so<00:05:12.310> that's<00:05:12.550> sitting

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
in and it's secure now so that's sitting

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.390 
in and it's secure now so that's sitting
where<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.540> needs<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.840> be<00:05:14.010> so<00:05:15.010> now<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.220> can

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
where it needs to be so now you can

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.530 
where it needs to be so now you can
start<00:05:15.760> putting<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.120> straighter<00:05:16.389> back

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
start putting it a straighter back

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.219 
start putting it a straighter back
together<00:05:16.870> you'll<00:05:17.110> pull<00:05:17.350> out<00:05:17.470> your<00:05:17.740> pin<00:05:18.130> and

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
together you'll pull out your pin and

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.100 
together you'll pull out your pin and
then<00:05:20.229> what<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.620> do<00:05:20.800> is<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.300> take<00:05:22.300> your<00:05:22.540> cam

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
then what you do is you take your cam

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.980 
then what you do is you take your cam
position<00:05:23.320> sensor<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:25.240> really<00:05:25.479> only<00:05:25.630> goes<00:05:25.870> on

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
position sensor it really only goes on

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.570 
position sensor it really only goes on
one<00:05:26.050> way<00:05:28.260> slide<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.410> down<00:05:29.560> but<00:05:29.979> locks<00:05:30.250> in<00:05:32.580> then

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
one way slide it down but locks in then

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.010 
one way slide it down but locks in then
you<00:05:33.700> take<00:05:33.880> your<00:05:34.740> rotor<00:05:35.910> or<00:05:36.910> your<00:05:37.090> that's

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
you take your rotor or your that's

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.140 
you take your rotor or your that's
called<00:05:38.290> a<00:05:38.350> rotor<00:05:38.500> take<00:05:39.130> your<00:05:39.250> rotor<00:05:39.400> put<00:05:40.030> your

your<00:06:15.789> distributor<00:06:16.240> cap<00:06:16.270> there<00:06:17.110> will<00:06:17.199> be<00:06:17.229> a

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
your distributor cap there will be a

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.719 
your distributor cap there will be a
little<00:06:17.800> marking<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.279> tells<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:18.610> it's

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
little marking that tells you it's

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.429 
little marking that tells you it's
number<00:06:18.939> 1<00:06:19.119> and<00:06:19.330> when<00:06:19.629> we<00:06:19.749> just<00:06:19.930> install<00:06:20.289> the

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:20.439 
number 1 and when we just install the

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.779 
number 1 and when we just install the
distributor<00:06:20.860> we<00:06:20.979> knew<00:06:21.129> that<00:06:21.279> this<00:06:21.430> was<00:06:21.610> number

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
distributor we knew that this was number

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.639 
distributor we knew that this was number
1<00:06:22.029> because<00:06:22.270> that's<00:06:22.449> where<00:06:22.689> the<00:06:23.229> rotor<00:06:23.439> was

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:23.649 
1 because that's where the rotor was

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.679 
1 because that's where the rotor was
pointing<00:06:24.099> so<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:24.789> goes<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.210> number<00:06:25.449> 1

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
pointing so that goes to number 1

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:33.029 
pointing so that goes to number 1
cylinder<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:29.279> then<00:06:30.749> rotating<00:06:32.039> rotating

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
cylinder and then rotating rotating

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:41.820 
cylinder and then rotating rotating
clockwise<00:06:33.249> it<00:06:33.879> was<00:06:34.089> number<00:06:34.719> 3<00:06:34.899> cylinder<00:06:40.830> this

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
clockwise it was number 3 cylinder this

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.570 
clockwise it was number 3 cylinder this
is<00:06:41.889> number<00:06:42.189> 4<00:06:42.490> cylinder<00:06:44.159> this<00:06:45.159> one<00:06:45.370> goes<00:06:45.550> to

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
is number 4 cylinder this one goes to

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:52.709 
is number 4 cylinder this one goes to
number<00:06:45.819> 4

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:59.239 

and<00:06:53.349> then<00:06:54.809> the<00:06:55.809> last<00:06:56.019> one<00:06:56.289> which<00:06:57.009> is<00:06:57.099> this<00:06:57.309> one

00:06:59.239 --> 00:06:59.249 
and then the last one which is this one

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:04.469 
and then the last one which is this one
goes<00:07:00.249> to<00:07:00.719> number<00:07:01.719> two<00:07:02.579> so<00:07:03.579> like<00:07:04.029> I<00:07:04.149> said<00:07:04.209> it

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
goes to number two so like I said it

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:13.769 
goes to number two so like I said it
goes<00:07:04.569> 1<00:07:06.329> 3<00:07:08.009> 4<00:07:09.009> 2<00:07:10.409> and<00:07:11.409> the<00:07:11.679> middle<00:07:11.919> one<00:07:12.779> the

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779 
goes 1 3 4 2 and the middle one the

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:17.339 
goes 1 3 4 2 and the middle one the
middle<00:07:13.809> one<00:07:14.049> goes<00:07:14.469> to<00:07:14.499> your<00:07:14.769> coil<00:07:15.099> pack
