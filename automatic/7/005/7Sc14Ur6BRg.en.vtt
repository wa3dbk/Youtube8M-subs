00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello my name is hansol and this is my 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.470
 new guide on fair can in the thirteenth 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 season patch 52 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.849
 many of you ask why i don't 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 I play in frost of course just very 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.109
 cheerful speck in it is very strong damage 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.660
 not fair mage always arrives more 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.490
 Damaga in tyflis than from frost magician if 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 certainly do it right it is very 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.470
 complex will require practice and so in this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.800
 video we'll take a closer look speck 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 rotation of the battlefield my build gear is that i for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.579
 pharma on 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 for starters I will say that fire mage in the most 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 strong quits of all classes if done 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 all right, then you can safely kill 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 target in 4 seconds deep freeze 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 fire mage can keep the target in control and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 for a very long time it is very useful for 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 rbg 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 and no less useful in the arena is polymorph 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 deep fritz kombu tires camp ice grip 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 blanks c lenses and dragon breeze burst fire 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.090
 mage is tied on rights and pituitary and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 most often if the command skill Aries if 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 you are not for control and killer 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 or another dispatcher then your lessons 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.500
 deep freeze and dota easily from the display and you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.930
 will stay with nothing on rbg magician convenient 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.549
 its speed candles with a 15 second 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.049
 blink and blazing in appearance 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 which increases your speed 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.270
 150 percent movement 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 although the frost benefits dad is much 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 more that confirms it later 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.340
 where 95 percent of mages play frost my and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 only 5 percent by fires however any 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.220
 magician will prove that power is much more 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 interesting to play 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.070
 rather than three button frost burst mages 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 tied to screams and to drive 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 pen bass you need two crit in a row you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.890
 beat about what or fireball and wait for 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.990
 he criticizes 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.960
 after the first crit you press a pebble 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 he criticizes and you get traffic jams robot 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.560
 which is very much dama gibt es 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.789
 or loading gave uk bushina just 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 eight seconds cool down 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.619
 so in certain situations you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.190
 can hang it refresh on yourself forces 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.470
 blink Kiev give him a sheep and then 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.950
 already rolled back a pebble and you cursed 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.860
 works before the mechanic fireman magician was 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.260
 harder and now when someone tires crit 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.170
 hundred percent it has become much easier 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.680
 but you may not have time to press it after 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 crit 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.670
 or push it to crit case then it 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 may affect the outcome of the game also 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.880
 paper is gorgeous passive shako 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.030
 which increases crit chance by 50 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.190
 percent if the target is frozen now 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.489
 I'm 50 percent crit 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.980
 I cast the phrase, let the sala and mayor 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.500
 living it i get 50 percent off 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 Right growth and I have one hundred percent 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.230
 crit for as much as 3 seconds so what 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.569
 need to kill a target in 4 seconds for 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.670
 beginning we will have to impose a fiery 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.769
 bomb which passive copy 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.950
 increases all damage taken by the target 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.630
 by ten percent for 15 seconds then 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.489
 you by any means 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.980
 must achieve pro copper regional 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.670
 freeze the target zayuzat all burst and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.109
 and bend visits then our rotation will go 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.940
 pen blood 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:26.400
 who tire er blast inferno blast per 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.130
 it will surely be killed but to heighten the effect 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 you can throw salt in or through 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.359
 presence of main throw job phrases also 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.670
 you can tie 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.549
 alter time during the first pro copier 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.970
 Blast and full burst and to get even 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.139
 one 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.139
 bursting feather bad 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.660
 The original is a review of talent. 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.410
 which you can look at our 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.660
 channel 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.830
 either by clicking on the talent area on 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.900
 screen so now consider the genes for 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.570
 fire mage method 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.970
 should be on intelligence and 3 percent 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.640
 creed and red nest 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.420
 should insert anthem 80 of intelligence and 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.870
 160 who dad faith or 80 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.830
 intellect and 160 a pair will merge into 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.709
 yellow nest 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.100
 I'm a panavto of collagen on 320 for a couple of onlookers 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.140
 and so i got 66 percent 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.690
 rice face which gives me the opportunity 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.430
 play in the arena without fear that for me 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.670
 take and 300k creed from some 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.330
 war and finally blue nests where am i 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.070
 put the gene on the 160 provider and 163 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.110
 strength 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.480
 it will help you gain a little more 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.990
 rice for long life and power 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.140
 thick 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.430
 on this perhaps all I hope you 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.020
 liked the guide with you was hansol 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.990

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.980
 voiced by Heralt with the support of the portal 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.980
