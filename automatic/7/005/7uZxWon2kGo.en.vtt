that<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.980> really<00:00:31.490> think<00:00:31.760> you<00:00:31.880> need<00:00:32.059> to<00:00:32.090> know

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
that I really think you need to know

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.209 
that I really think you need to know
about<00:00:32.419> their<00:00:32.750> safety<00:00:32.870> technologies<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
about their safety technologies the

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.529 
about their safety technologies the
first<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:34.579> is<00:00:34.670> called<00:00:34.789> the<00:00:34.910> G<00:00:35.239> cell

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
first one is called the G cell

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.860 
first one is called the G cell
technology<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.289> what<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.309> its<00:00:37.870> rebound

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
technology and what it is is its rebound

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.470 
technology and what it is is its rebound
foam<00:00:39.350> technology<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.250> surrounds<00:00:40.550> your<00:00:41.150> baby

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
foam technology that surrounds your baby

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.220 
foam technology that surrounds your baby
and<00:00:41.780> it's<00:00:42.200> designed<00:00:42.650> to<00:00:42.860> mitigate<00:00:43.190> first

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
and it's designed to mitigate first

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.380 
and it's designed to mitigate first
impact<00:00:45.230> energy<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.760> does<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.210> it's

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
impact energy so what that does is it's

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.840 
impact energy so what that does is it's
gonna<00:00:47.510> absorb<00:00:47.989> moderate<00:00:48.800> some<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.579> first

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
gonna absorb moderate some of that first

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.090 
gonna absorb moderate some of that first
impact<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.960> collision<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:51.890> doesn't

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
impact in a collision so that it doesn't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400 
impact in a collision so that it doesn't
all<00:00:52.340> go<00:00:52.550> into<00:00:52.790> your<00:00:53.030> baby<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.780> second<00:00:54.110> one<00:00:54.200> it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
all go into your baby the second one it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.830 
all go into your baby the second one it
is<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.070> air<00:00:55.520> protect<00:00:56.120> side<00:00:56.450> impact

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
is the air protect side impact

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.479 
is the air protect side impact
protection<00:00:56.899> that's<00:00:57.590> these<00:00:57.800> head<00:00:58.040> wings<00:00:58.250> up

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
protection that's these head wings up

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.700 
protection that's these head wings up
here<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.540> is<00:00:59.719> designed<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.230> protect<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
here and that is designed to protect the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.799 
here and that is designed to protect the
most<00:01:00.890> important<00:01:01.399> part<00:01:01.610> which<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:02.030> your<00:01:02.239> baby's

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
most important part which is your baby's

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.560 
most important part which is your baby's
head<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:04.040> does<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.519> by<00:01:04.969> immediately

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
head and it does that by immediately

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.499 
head and it does that by immediately
reducing<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.590> forces<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.430> impact<00:01:07.820> forces<00:01:08.149> of

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
reducing the forces the impact forces of

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.169 
reducing the forces the impact forces of
a<00:01:08.719> collision<00:01:09.170> by<00:01:09.619> releasing<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.340> precise

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
a collision by releasing a precise

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.330 
a collision by releasing a precise
amount<00:01:11.359> of<00:01:11.630> air<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.439> that's<00:01:12.679> gonna<00:01:12.920> protect

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
amount of air so that's gonna protect

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.120 
amount of air so that's gonna protect
your<00:01:13.520> baby's<00:01:13.909> head<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.929> also<00:01:15.109> has<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.649> rebound

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
your baby's head it also has a rebound

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.789 
your baby's head it also has a rebound
bar<00:01:16.429> and<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:16.969> connected<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.899> base<00:01:18.439> and

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
bar and it is connected to the base and

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.510 
bar and it is connected to the base and
what<00:01:19.039> that<00:01:19.189> does<00:01:19.399> is<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.209> prevents<00:01:20.780> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
what that does is it prevents the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.169 
what that does is it prevents the
rotational<00:01:23.950> motion<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.639> infant<00:01:25.999> carseat

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
rotational motion of the infant carseat

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.690 
rotational motion of the infant carseat
in<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.600> Ford<00:01:27.139> or<00:01:27.380> rear-facing<00:01:27.649> collision<00:01:28.459> so

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
in a Ford or rear-facing collision so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.419 
in a Ford or rear-facing collision so
instead<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.569> your<00:01:29.689> baby<00:01:29.929> slamming<00:01:30.799> into<00:01:31.039> the

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
instead of your baby slamming into the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.769 
instead of your baby slamming into the
back<00:01:31.609> of<00:01:31.639> the<00:01:31.909> vehicle<00:01:32.270> seat<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.630> they're

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
back of the vehicle seat that they're

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.840 
back of the vehicle seat that they're
facing<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.590> gonna<00:01:33.829> prevent<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.579> because

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
facing it's gonna prevent that because

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.660 
facing it's gonna prevent that because
this<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.299> gonna<00:01:35.539> hit<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.170> vehicle<00:01:37.159> seat<00:01:37.490> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
this is gonna hit the vehicle seat and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.120 
this is gonna hit the vehicle seat and
absorb<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.479> it's<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.779> to<00:01:39.130> stabilize

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
absorb that so it's going to stabilize

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.980 
absorb that so it's going to stabilize
the<00:01:40.369> car<00:01:40.549> seat<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:40.939> really<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
the car seat so I really like the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.410 
the car seat so I really like the
rebound<00:01:42.439> bar<00:01:42.679> being<00:01:43.009> part<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:44.240> there's

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
rebound bar being part of it now there's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.760 
rebound bar being part of it now there's
a<00:01:44.450> couple<00:01:44.539> convenience<00:01:45.049> features<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.560> course

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
a couple convenience features of course

and<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.480> fact<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:10.930> everything<00:05:11.290> else

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470

is<00:05:11.650> pretty<00:05:11.860> easy<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.400> rebound<00:05:12.700> bar<00:05:12.970> that's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
is pretty easy in the rebound bar that's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.260 
is pretty easy in the rebound bar that's
a<00:05:13.510> really<00:05:13.960> good<00:05:14.110> safety<00:05:14.730> touch<00:05:15.730> there<00:05:16.030> so
