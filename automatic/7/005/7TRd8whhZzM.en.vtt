00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the world so I had to pick up on other

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.520 
the world so I had to pick up on other
things<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.690> try<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.379> work

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
things so you know I just try and work

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
things so you know I just try and work
hard<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:01.920> game<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.270> hopefully<00:01:03.449> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
hard on my game and you know hopefully I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
hard on my game and you know hopefully I
things<00:01:04.080> come<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.559> yeah<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.570> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
things come from that yeah I think if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
things come from that yeah I think if
you<00:01:06.689> watch<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:07.020> play<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.530> definitely<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you watch me play I'm definitely not the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
you watch me play I'm definitely not the
fastest<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.790> influencer<00:01:09.540> I've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
fastest like that influencer I've got a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.690 
fastest like that influencer I've got a
probably<00:01:10.650> usually<00:01:10.770> run<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.520> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
probably usually run a little bit more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.450 
probably usually run a little bit more
than<00:01:11.909> other<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:13.350> aspects<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> game<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
than other other aspects of the game I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.510 
than other other aspects of the game I
suppose<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.180> definitely<00:01:16.140> um<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.040> trying

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
suppose so definitely um you know trying

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
suppose so definitely um you know trying
to<00:01:17.580> marshal<00:01:18.030> people<00:01:18.299> around<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.229> himself

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to marshal people around and get himself

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
to marshal people around and get himself
into<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:20.009> spot<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> think

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you always been like you know quite

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
relative I think it comes with a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.560 
relative I think it comes with a
position<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.680> play<00:01:35.830> as<00:01:36.040> well<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.390> may<00:01:37.510> you
