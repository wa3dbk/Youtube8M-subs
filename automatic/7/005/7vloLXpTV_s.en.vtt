00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 you already have to share with you and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 are and said there's tension hi what about 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.110
 how are you again here in those streets 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 they asked me the question that I thought 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.260
 quite interesting 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 maybe the video to talk about the 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.490
 question that I'm going to use as a theme for 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.010
 this video asked me if it was wrong 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 seen without obscenities to tell piropos 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.580
 the girls in japan I will give you my 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.250
 impressions according to what I have seen 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 and learned in the time I've been here 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.420
 piropos are not used in japan so 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 I think a woman would be surprised if a 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.650
 stranger approaches him and tells him a compliment 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 I do not think it's so bad that it's frowned upon 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.879
 do it simply that they would not know how 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 react because it is not the custom 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.620
 Japanese and I do not think they have the concept 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 of the pyrope I think the reaction of the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 girl depends a lot on the situation and the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 environment and also depends on the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270
 personality the same girl that she 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.040
 I did the compliment if it's a girl who 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.390
 is more exposed to culture 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.370
 western you may feel 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.829
 flattered and if you blush and smile and follow 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 walking but I think there would be many 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 girls who would not know how to react and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 they would only give a bow of thanks and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 continue walking because they are not 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.240
 used to hearing something like that in the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.860
 street and I think there would be girls who 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.960
 they also felt ashamed 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 if there are people around contradicts the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.790
 I compliment because what less people want 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.460
 Japanese is to draw attention or be the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.140
 center of attention really that the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.630
 reaction by the pilot depends a lot on 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 the girl and her personality but as the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.200
 pyrope concept is not part of the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.870
 Japanese culture I think a lot of people 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
 I just would not know how to react in 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.590
 I think more than a compliment to him 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.050
 tell a girl loudly in full 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.820
 street in front of other people the most 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 appropriate not to embarrass the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.770
 to bother her would be to tell her the most 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.050
 discrete something like kawaii cne that is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.170
 how to tell him or this one is very nice 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.130
 and that's enough to not run the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 risk of scaring her uncomfortable there 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 good people but there are also people with 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.290
 bad intentions and you can not know 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 how strange do you have good intentions and 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.820
 that others do not and women are 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.040
 careful and maintain a level of 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.530
 distrust to protect and maintain 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.720
 your safety and I think in many cases 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 women do not react to our 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.800
 compliments the way we 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.760
 men we would like to ask me the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.129
 girls who are watching this video 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.739
 how much they like to be told 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.290
 compliments without profanity in the streets 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.379
 strangers 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.599
 good thanks for watching me I'm leo and japan 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.750
