00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.130
 once the two greyhounds have been put 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 to compete because the trailero as we have 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 said before he has released the leash and the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.200
 greyhounds have been released during the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.440
 race will verify all the 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.039
 trials a total of five people who 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.869
 carry or carry horses and that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.600
 Both are going to gallop the race on horseback 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 to visualize it as close as possible 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.019
 if they use English thoroughbred horses 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.320
 that are the only ones capable of following the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 speed of a greyhound that is an average 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.800
 of 60 kilometers per hour during the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.409
 race before the only animals that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120
 are able to follow this greyhound goes to 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.979
 be an English Thoroughbred 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.839
 so as I say it's going to see five 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.150
 people who gallop in the race and who 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.850
 visualized in the race are a commissioner 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.790
 which it is the highest authority within the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.549
 career and are the one that will safeguard 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.930
 that the regulation is being complied with 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.820
 three judges on horseback who are the ones 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 they carry the handkerchiefs and they are the ones 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.769
 they are going to rule that greyhound is the one that has 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.780
 won and finally the timekeeper is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 a judge who simply carries a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.170
 stopwatch and that is going to verify that the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.630
 career 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.030
 we have said before it will last more than 55 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.440
 seconds first of all if the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.740
 race lasts less than 55 seconds 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 would be declared null and the judges would cut 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.200
 a yellow handkerchief 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.780
 as we said before also if the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.500
 race wins the length of the handkerchief 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.270
 White 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.310
 the judges would wear a white handkerchief 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.799
 It may be that two judges believe that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.170
 won the white and that one is always 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.520
 by majority would be the one that dictates the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 race if two judges believe they make to 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.200
 white and one red would win the race by 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.789
 supposed white collar but I can pass 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.520
 one more thing than as in any other 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.789
 sport may be that one of the greyhounds 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.170
 does not comply with the regulations of the 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.250
 Greyhound racing in the field is very 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.840
 extensive and summarizing how much we can 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.300
 say that a greyhound does not meet the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.850
 regulation when it does not follow perfectly 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.190
 the trajectory that marks the hare the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.310
 greyhounds as they become more 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.470
 older and who are competing more 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 tend to the law of least effort 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.019
 tend to shorten the distance that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.680
 separates between the hare and them in a way 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.590
 advantageous that the judges do not value it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.660
 with first yellow card 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.190
 Wearing a yellow handkerchief, one black and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.560
 the color of the greyhound's handkerchief 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.340
 example if they warn that if we call it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560
 love 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.239
 the white handkerchief would cut into a handkerchief 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 white yellow handkerchief and black handkerchief 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.430
 that means yellow card for the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.739
 greyhound that you have not followed or that you have not 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.330
 complied with the regulation if in a second 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.980
 race that greyhound 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.650
 in that same tie or in another 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.560
 later it does the same again and as 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 already has a yellow card the judges 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.709
 they would disqualify doing something because they 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.840
 is complying with the regulation and what 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.049
 would disqualify and then they would carry a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.760
 handkerchief black and without the yellow and the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.700
 greyhound handkerchief that has been 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.050
 disqualified vale there is another aspect that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.020
 it can also be 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.420
 that might define the race and it's 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.730
 that one of the two greyhounds decides to decide 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.160
 abandon the persecution if for example 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.510
 after the career after the race 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.340
 what are they doing behind the hare 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.070
 one of the two greyhounds decided to abandon 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.510
 the race and the pse or if it supposes the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.520
 disqualification of that greyhound although 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 until that time was winning the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.870
 race if at a certain time 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.030
 decides to abandon the persecution that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.400
 greyhound is disqualified and therefore 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.900
 would win the career of the greyhound that carries 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 to the other handkerchief 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.069
 this is a bit the summary of the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.599
 competition as we have said before for 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.700
 can move on to the next tie 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.900
 one of the two greyhounds has to win at 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.900
 minus two races
