00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hi, how are you all good? 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.640
 welcome to your home welcome 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:13.200
 Carlos, I am very happy with the kings 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:15.030
 magicians have behaved elite too 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 but I know there have been people 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.539
 that has been another excellent being because I 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.789
 by eating save the van 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.859
 photograph people delivered to Annex 9 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.080
 that without sheikhs and cube motor that yes 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 nexus 6 galaxy the people are very 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 Exactly generous and for that we bring this 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 video to start with a smartphone 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.189
 new if you have given it to you if you have 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.189
 Giving all the tips 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.900
 well let's go there let's start 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.490
 with the first advice is the first one not 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.170
 by chance you may have 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.270
 for then terminal or maybe some 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.770
 relative of yours can be seen as gift and walks 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.000
 pretty lost and usually one of 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.340
 the first conversations that are usually 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.830
 have hear and the contacts you will have them in 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.960
 gmail and in another it tells you where my 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.730
 contacts please is the most important 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680
 because in the end a phone if you do not have 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.360
 to your people with whom you communicate 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 It's useless and that's why we have 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.210
 the perfect tool 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.290
 let's talk and we want that is the most 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.490
 It is recommended that you install a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.900
 application of which we have already spoken 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.000
 in three we have dealt with the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.410
 developer as it is perpetual is a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.090
 application to keep your contacts 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.070
 updated but that has a 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.180
 functionality that many are unaware of and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 maybe it is an indispensable tool 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.930
 It is very useful especially for those who 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 they are starting even for the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.550
 users a little more knowledgeable in this topic 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.979
 we can synchronize our contact 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.390
 make backup copy them directly to 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.950
 our google account and most 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.750
 Interestingly always contacts 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.340
 update without having to do 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.570
 us at hand is a wonder not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.100
 we're going to have to bite because that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.110
 person may not have them in gmail 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.070
 it is installed in the old mobile is made 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.680
 a backup 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.090
 the new mobile and here nothing happened very 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.580
 ok we have the contacts but now 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.080
 Carlos the classics tell you where they are 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.330
 the photos of the community of chiquillo 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 they like the photo that he sells to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.560
 azzurro the bathroom mirror because you 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.000
 change your mobile or you lose it 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 they steal anything and many of these 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.760
 photographs can be lost from here 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 our second advice is that you 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 you are accustomed from scratch since you have a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.890
 terminal then to use services of 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.450
 'cloud either well drive 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.690
 either to dropbox there are many alternatives 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.220
 and some of them as we say we have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.140
 ways to upload instantaneously 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.000
 our photography race drop with flash 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 of google + with which we will have them 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 always saved and apart from photos but 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.220
 obviously any other file my 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.630
 drive I like a lot besides it 's very 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.610
 important in many of the terminals 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 if they are not high- end you may have little 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.060
 memory storage sure that some 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.200
 file some video that you can leave 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 in the cloud that erase it in your 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 good device said this we already have 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.019
 the contacts the photos all the sayings 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.300
 the important thing is Carlos did not expect a 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.700
 vital relief when and where and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.500
 breathe eat and sleep comes when you 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.150
 can give a whim and I caprice like 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.070
 tune up your mobile that is something that to me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.410
 we like it a lot we can put it inside 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 outside for what 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.640
 I really know that there are many 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.870
 complements in this case from here you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.550
 we invite you to take a look for 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 example we also have a beautiful friend 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.720
 how is my friend and font that has a 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.190
 catalog then practically everything 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.450
 only not only remains in the section 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.070
 from outside we not only have covers 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.870
 screen we have protectors now that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.520
 there is a universe of complements that 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.870
 you can use it that I complement 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.280
 for the car and even batteries 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.590
 external although much is appreciated 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.300
 practical and useful is not to give it a spin 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.400
 of nut to give more utility to your 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
 smartphone or that is prettier practical 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.660
 or resistant that are subjects 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 obviously very important and once 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 we have it carlos customized by outside 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.480
 and with all the accessories we're going to 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.980
 see it inside since the good thing that 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.210
 has android is that it is super 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.650
 customizable carlos and here we have 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.760
 spoken a thousand times of applications that the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.830
 true what applications are there 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.330
 essentials there are some ceilings not 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.950
 we come for that we're going to see you maybe 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.180
 some advice but for you because 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.980
 Like you are already a little bit more 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.420
 chastened and you master a little more the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.650
 Android territory but maybe that 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.420
 person who has given the mobile more 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 has lost something very elementary and that 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.660
 We usually recommend especially in 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.460
 Mid-low range terminals is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.470
 install an alternative side if it is 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.390
 a classic the launcher usually gives 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.770
 another life to your terminal you can also 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.050
 install different widgets 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.760
 to make it more customizable and visual 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.620
 all the information that you are seeing or 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.900
 customize the wallpaper the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.460
 keyboard and so on here Carlos we have done 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.750
 a playlist with a lot 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.420
 of applications for many years 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.220
 At this point you have your mobile 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.900
 with your cast with your accessories and the 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.730
 ost drive with your applications the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.380
 cloud service and so on and there is an aspect 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.000
 very important that we should value and that 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.440
 I must admit that until now 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.390
 a long time did not lend him all the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.400
 attention and it's security there 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.690
 vital information on your device there is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.060
 many things that you may not 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.290
 want others to see a lot of 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.970
 attention to these exact tips is 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.830
 priority I think it is very important 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.020
 that is awareness of this concept and I 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.810
 start with something as simple as 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.910
 put an unlock pattern a code 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.350
 it can already be with what you want if 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.700
 you have a smartphone that has detection 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.380
 of fingerprint you can also 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.150
 do with this system but that there 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.190
 some security system that does not 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.600
 can take the terminal unlock it and 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.760
 access all the information as well 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.900
 you say there are many terminals even 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.520
 many Chinese terminals that we have 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.930
 analyzed with fingerprint reader or if not 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.000
 The basic unlocking pattern is not 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.740
 matter but do not make the mistake that 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.810
 someone can pick up the phone and see things 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.670
 that you do not want otherwise this is the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.960
 pulled apart 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.450
 of the software two appointments you can do 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.160
 but then if it happens there is a little bit more 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.230
 forward that you must also know are 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.720
 third-party applications or even 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.190
 use or that you become aware of a 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.560
 application of a website that is called 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.730
 Android device manager that once 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.380
 you do it with your gmail account 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.390
 you will be able to locate it, you will be able to 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.250
 block it and even make it sound so 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.810
 simple like that if you've already had the 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.300
 bad luck that they have rolled you've 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.130
 lost at least able to access 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.960
 this application to be able to see where 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.670
 I was blocking it and so on as it is 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.200
 very very important information besides 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.820
 this is very, very, very applications 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.530
 cured in the google play for example 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.120
 Brewer is a magnificent application 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.890
 updated in material design and that 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.630
 takes a little more this section the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.040
 security for example there are details like 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.840
 whatever is invoked on the pin does this 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.350
 the photograph and also the account of 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.670
 mail 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.460
 Of course I do, so I hope you were 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.680
 helped all these tips carlos these 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.840
 advice if you have a smartphone then 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.430
 you already know and if you know someone what 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.110
 have you given a smartphone please 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.640
 send in this video that can be of 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.200
 much useful so good we hope 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.670
 that you enjoyed enjoy your new 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.150
 terminal and see you soon afterwards 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.150
 something
