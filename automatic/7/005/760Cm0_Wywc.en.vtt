00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
track like all your maps that it's a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
me or fits the track but that's the only

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
me or fits the track but that's the only
really<00:01:57.659> dislike<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.799> don't

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really dislike I like about them I don't

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.999 
really dislike I like about them I don't
like<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> money<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.950> said

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
like about the money and as I said

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
like about the money and as I said
before<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.880> built<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
before right I built it so you have to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
before right I built it so you have to
go<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.170> fast<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.649> possible<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
go as fast as possible and you know it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.719 
go as fast as possible and you know it
is<00:02:05.880> pasta<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.740> capable<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.489> making

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is pasta it is you are capable of making

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.520 
is pasta it is you are capable of making
it<00:02:09.060> up<00:02:09.179> there<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.780> kidding<00:02:10.080> yeah

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it up there and I'm just kidding yeah

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.910 
it up there and I'm just kidding yeah
I've<00:02:10.619> made<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.190> before

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
I've made it up there before

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.320 
I've made it up there before
it's<00:02:13.130> not<00:02:13.250> difficult<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.819> make<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.209> you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's not difficult to make it up you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.680 
it's not difficult to make it up you
just<00:02:14.480> can't<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.020> going<00:02:15.170> slow<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.510> guess<00:02:17.510> I'm<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
just can't be going slow I guess I'm a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.390 
just can't be going slow I guess I'm a
failed<00:02:17.900> driver<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.800> thing<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.069> do<00:02:22.130> think

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
failed driver but one thing I do think

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
failed driver but one thing I do think
it<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.610> work<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.300> little<00:02:24.110> bit<00:02:24.260> as<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.830> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
it can work on a little bit as this you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.180 
it can work on a little bit as this you
turn<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.430> here<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.770> should<00:02:27.950> have<00:02:28.069> made

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
turn up here I think I should have made

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.220 
turn up here I think I should have made
it<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.730> little<00:02:29.120> bit<00:02:29.330> less<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.600> an<00:02:29.840> incline

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
it like a little bit less of an incline

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.900 
it like a little bit less of an incline
on<00:02:30.500> because<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.840> know<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:32.989> just<00:02:33.170> can't<00:02:33.350> go

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
on because you know you just can't go

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.790 
on because you know you just can't go
all<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.360> way<00:02:35.390> around<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.380> i<00:02:36.440> guess<00:02:36.620> i<00:02:36.739> mean

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
all the way around it i guess i mean

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.960 
all the way around it i guess i mean
it's<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.980> little<00:02:37.100> difficult<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.670> get<00:02:37.880> around

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's a little difficult to get around

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.520 
it's a little difficult to get around
and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.660> built<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.200> way<00:02:39.350> on

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and I kind of built it that way on

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.550 
and I kind of built it that way on
purpose<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:40.269> little<00:02:41.269> too<00:02:41.390> steep<00:02:41.600> i<00:02:41.780> guess<00:02:41.989> yeah

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
purpose a little too steep i guess yeah

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.140 
purpose a little too steep i guess yeah
that's<00:02:43.040> what<00:02:43.250> I'm<00:02:43.370> saying<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.760> think<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that's what I'm saying I think it's a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.509 
that's what I'm saying I think it's a
little<00:02:44.209> too<00:02:44.330> steep<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:46.220> know<00:02:46.340> that

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
little too steep and you know that

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.100 
little too steep and you know that
that's<00:02:46.819> my<00:02:46.970> fault<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.420> should<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.750> built<00:02:47.930> it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that's my fault I should have built it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.830 
that's my fault I should have built it
not<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:48.530> steep<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.220> apologize<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.910> um

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
not as steep and I apologize for that um

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.270 
not as steep and I apologize for that um
but<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.440> know<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.650> does<00:02:51.769> add<00:02:51.950> some

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
but you know it does add some

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.460 
but you know it does add some
competitive<00:02:53.120> because<00:02:53.360> if<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.780> slow<00:02:54.019> down<00:02:54.200> too

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
competitive because if you slow down too

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.840 
competitive because if you slow down too
much<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:54.980> around<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.549> get<00:02:55.670> past

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
much to get around you can get past

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.000 
much to get around you can get past
easily<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> also<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.590> even<00:02:57.709> touch

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
easily and also if you even touch

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.500 
easily and also if you even touch
another<00:02:58.280> driver<00:02:58.640> going<00:02:59.060> around<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.390> you're

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
another driver going around that you're

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
just a thing I put my maps because I

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.580 
just a thing I put my maps because I
think<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.540> looks<00:03:32.570> cool<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:34.630> yeah<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:35.959> there's

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
think it looks cool and yeah so there's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.140 
think it looks cool and yeah so there's
all<00:03:36.709> these<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.180> um<00:03:39.100> feel<00:03:40.100> free<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.340> speak<00:03:40.940> now

if<00:03:41.480> you'd<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:43.600> there's<00:03:44.600> not<00:03:44.720> too<00:03:44.930> much

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
if you'd like there's not too much

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.470 
if you'd like there's not too much
scenery<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.829> map<00:03:46.100> but<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.450> that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
scenery on the map but there is that

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.300 
scenery on the map but there is that
purple<00:03:47.989> Rock<00:03:48.170> which<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.470> love<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.829> love<00:03:48.859> like<00:03:49.160> you

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
purple Rock which I love I love like you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.400 
purple Rock which I love I love like you
know<00:03:49.430> anything<00:03:50.180> like<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.540> last<00:03:50.570> box<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.290> know

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
know anything like the last box you know

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.729 
know anything like the last box you know
I<00:03:51.670> also<00:03:52.670> have<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.940> waterfall<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:54.320> waterfall

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
I also have a waterfall the waterfall

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.309 
I also have a waterfall the waterfall
yeah<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.450> definitely<00:03:56.870> hard<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.109> see

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
yeah it's it's definitely hard to see

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.930 
yeah it's it's definitely hard to see
and<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.950> know<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.250> video<00:03:58.519> is<00:03:58.579> going<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.790> be<00:03:58.910> a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
and I know the video is going to be a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.819 
and I know the video is going to be a
lot<00:03:59.150> darker<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.750> actual<00:04:00.079> map<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.769> the

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
lot darker the actual map is and the

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.470 
lot darker the actual map is and the
reason<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.130> did<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.579> because<00:04:02.180> when<00:04:02.329> you're

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
reason I did this is because when you're

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.289 
reason I did this is because when you're
going<00:04:02.630> over<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.549> stunt<00:04:04.549> ramp<00:04:04.760> section<00:04:05.180> which

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
going over the stunt ramp section which

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.819 
going over the stunt ramp section which
is<00:04:05.329> where<00:04:05.569> most<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.019> collisions<00:04:06.470> happens

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
is where most of the collisions happens

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.059 
is where most of the collisions happens
it's<00:04:07.329> virtually<00:04:08.329> impossible<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:09.380> see<00:04:09.889> other

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
it's virtually impossible to see other

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.979 
it's virtually impossible to see other
drivers<00:04:10.579> just<00:04:10.730> because<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.209> blend<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.750> so

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
drivers just because you blend in so

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.379 
drivers just because you blend in so
well<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> stunt<00:04:12.799> ramps<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.489> because<00:04:14.060> I

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
well to the stunt ramps and because I

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.330 
well to the stunt ramps and because I
mean<00:04:14.870> going<00:04:15.170> over<00:04:15.410> these<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.280> you

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
mean going over these it's you know you

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.949 
mean going over these it's you know you
really<00:04:16.609> can't<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.120> other<00:04:17.269> drivers<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
really can't see other drivers and the

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.870 
really can't see other drivers and the
only<00:04:18.139> time<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.530> do<00:04:18.859> see<00:04:19.070> them<00:04:19.130> as<00:04:19.280> when<00:04:19.850> you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
only time you do see them as when you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.339 
only time you do see them as when you
get<00:04:20.090> really<00:04:20.329> close<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:20.989> see<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
get really close and you can see the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.800 
get really close and you can see the
headlights<00:04:21.769> so<00:04:22.120> that's<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.270> reason<00:04:23.539> I<00:04:23.599> put

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
headlights so that's the reason I put

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.860 
headlights so that's the reason I put
the<00:04:23.930> dark

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
the dark

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.170 
the dark
Don<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.979> know<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.310> video<00:04:26.610> always<00:04:26.880> makes<00:04:27.060> a

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
Don and I know the video always makes a

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
Don and I know the video always makes a
dark<00:04:27.360> them<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.660> actually<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.320> if<00:04:28.410> you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
dark them that actually is so if you

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.530 
dark them that actually is so if you
actually<00:04:28.639> download<00:04:29.639> this<00:04:29.760> map<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.210> play<00:04:30.389> on

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
actually download this map and play on

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
actually download this map and play on
it<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.840> will<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:30.960> brighter<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.630> yeah<00:04:33.840> makes

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
it it will be brighter and so yeah makes

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.110 
it it will be brighter and so yeah makes
it<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.830> bit<00:04:34.949> more<00:04:35.100> difficult<00:04:35.280> but<00:04:35.910> more

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it a little bit more difficult but more

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.189 
it a little bit more difficult but more
fun<00:04:36.330> though<00:04:36.680> yeah<00:04:37.680> i<00:04:38.070> mean<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:39.389> maps<00:04:39.660> fumble

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
fun though yeah i mean this maps fumble

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.689 
fun though yeah i mean this maps fumble
and<00:04:40.350> it's<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.770> dark<00:04:40.979> it's<00:04:41.160> even<00:04:41.340> more<00:04:41.460> fun

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
and it's in the dark it's even more fun

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.270

failed<00:04:57.330> attempt<00:04:57.780> at<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.960> nook<00:04:58.470> shook<00:04:58.680> which<00:04:58.860> is

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
failed attempt at a nook shook which is

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.680 
failed attempt at a nook shook which is
basically<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.729> rock<00:05:00.720> man<00:05:01.260> person<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.479> he<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.660> in

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
basically a rock man person and he is in

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.939 
basically a rock man person and he is in
the<00:05:03.900> middle<00:05:04.229> of<00:05:04.380> my<00:05:05.780> u-turn<00:05:06.800> section<00:05:07.800> that

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
the middle of my u-turn section that

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.680 
the middle of my u-turn section that
Cola<00:05:08.250> sack<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.180> really<00:05:09.419> does<00:05:09.660> look

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
Cola sack and it it really does look

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.900 
Cola sack and it it really does look
like<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.050> snowman<00:05:10.530> actually<00:05:11.130> so<00:05:11.340> if<00:05:11.729> you're

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
like a snowman actually so if you're

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.640 
like a snowman actually so if you're
wondering<00:05:12.060> what<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.840> was<00:05:13.229> attempted

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
wondering what that is it was attempted

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.189 
wondering what that is it was attempted
to<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:14.070> man<00:05:14.970> made<00:05:15.240> out<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.510> rocks<00:05:15.780> but<00:05:16.050> it

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
to be a man made out of rocks but it

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.080 
to be a man made out of rocks but it
ended<00:05:16.350> up<00:05:16.440> looking<00:05:16.650> like<00:05:16.830> snowman<00:05:17.460> but

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
ended up looking like snowman but

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.460 
ended up looking like snowman but
because<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.479> map<00:05:18.690> was<00:05:18.810> completed<00:05:19.320> before

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860

of my own tracks i have and the reason

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.690 
of my own tracks i have and the reason
it<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:40.349> long<00:05:40.680> it's<00:05:40.919> just<00:05:41.130> because<00:05:41.460> like

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
it is so long it's just because like

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.670 
it is so long it's just because like
it's<00:05:41.910> not<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.300> I<00:05:42.360> died<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.630> lot<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.169> times<00:05:43.410> in

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
it's not that I died a lot of times in

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.279 
it's not that I died a lot of times in
it<00:05:43.830> because<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:44.849> just<00:05:45.300> cut<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.660> respawn<00:05:46.050> time

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
it because I just cut the respawn time

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.830 
it because I just cut the respawn time
out<00:05:46.440> anyways<00:05:46.830> but<00:05:47.039> um<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:48.300> know<00:05:48.450> this<00:05:48.630> track

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
out anyways but um you know this track

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.050 
out anyways but um you know this track
is<00:05:49.020> about<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.410> about<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:50.070> two<00:05:50.340> minute<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.700> 15

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
is about it about a two minute and 15

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.339 
is about it about a two minute and 15
seconds<00:05:51.389> left<00:05:51.570> I'm<00:05:51.780> which<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.139> actually

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
seconds left I'm which is actually

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.800 
seconds left I'm which is actually
pretty<00:05:52.710> decent<00:05:52.950> because<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.639> mean<00:05:54.240> most<00:05:54.389> double

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
pretty decent because I mean most double

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.589 
pretty decent because I mean most double
wides<00:05:54.990> are<00:05:55.229> very<00:05:55.470> short<00:05:55.979> I<00:05:56.220> think<00:05:56.849> one<00:05:57.419> of<00:05:57.449> the

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
wides are very short I think one of the

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.060 
wides are very short I think one of the
shortest<00:05:57.810> ones<00:05:58.139> I've<00:05:58.289> raced<00:05:58.440> on<00:05:58.650> was<00:05:58.830> only

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
shortest ones I've raced on was only

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.100 
shortest ones I've raced on was only
like<00:05:59.190> 30<00:05:59.580> seconds<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.270> when<00:06:00.510> you<00:06:00.630> have<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.810> 30

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
like 30 seconds and when you have a 30

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.529 
like 30 seconds and when you have a 30
second<00:06:01.650> lap<00:06:02.460> time<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.000> really<00:06:03.270> just<00:06:03.330> takes

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
second lap time and it really just takes

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.689 
second lap time and it really just takes
away<00:06:04.050> from<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.320> map<00:06:04.590> i<00:06:04.800> think<00:06:05.039> but<00:06:05.490> if<00:06:05.610> you

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
away from the map i think but if you

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.370 
away from the map i think but if you
have<00:06:05.789> too<00:06:05.970> long<00:06:06.210> like<00:06:06.479> four<00:06:06.780> minutes<00:06:07.050> at

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
have too long like four minutes at

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.460 
have too long like four minutes at
communites<00:06:07.979> it<00:06:08.520> gets<00:06:08.849> really<00:06:09.090> boring<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.289> race

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
communites it gets really boring to race

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.240 
communites it gets really boring to race
on<00:06:10.710> like<00:06:11.010> not<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:11.940> not<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.360> UM<00:06:12.840> like<00:06:13.830> judge

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
toward afford rule that's like a

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.409 
toward afford rule that's like a
six-minute<00:06:20.070> lifetime<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.880> I<00:06:20.940> just<00:06:21.180> think

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
six-minute lifetime and I just think

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.960 
six-minute lifetime and I just think
it's<00:06:21.630> a<00:06:21.900> really<00:06:22.530> boring<00:06:22.860> race<00:06:23.220> track<00:06:23.580> along
