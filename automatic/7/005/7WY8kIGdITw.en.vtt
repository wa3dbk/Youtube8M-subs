00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
decided to do this this is going to be a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.580 
decided to do this this is going to be a
review<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.299> physicians<00:00:15.809> formula<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
review on the physicians formula and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.700 
review on the physicians formula and
these<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.150> correcting<00:00:18.930> primers<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
these are the correcting primers and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
these are the correcting primers and
this<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:24.140> did<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
this is what they look like I did a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.560 
this is what they look like I did a
similar<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> very<00:00:27.210> similar

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870 
I guess to these and these are the mini
ones<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> actually<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.430> highlight

been<00:01:28.740> using<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.189> pretty<00:01:29.460> much<00:01:29.610> every<00:01:29.880> day

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
been using this pretty much every day

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
been using this pretty much every day
because<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.390> been<00:01:30.570> hot<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.159> need<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because it's been hot and I don't need a

because it's been hot and I don't need a
lot<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> coverage<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.780> makeup

lot of coverage and when I do put makeup

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
lot of coverage and when I do put makeup
on<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.590> normally<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> these<00:01:36.420> work<00:01:36.750> very

with the primer I really don't see the

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.360 
with the primer I really don't see the
notice<00:04:15.780> really<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.500> stay<00:04:17.709> ability<00:04:18.130> of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
your foundation

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.560 
your foundation

the Neutrogena Healthy Skin I think

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.350 
the Neutrogena Healthy Skin I think
foundation<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:27.250> stayed<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:27.610> pretty<00:04:28.180> much

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
foundation and it stayed on pretty much

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.720 
foundation and it stayed on pretty much
the<00:04:28.780> same<00:04:28.990> as<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.350> would<00:04:29.470> normally<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.250> then

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
the same as it would normally and then

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.240 
the same as it would normally and then
I've<00:04:30.850> used<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.240> with<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.470> mean<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.980> like

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
I've used it with this so I mean I like

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.040

both<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.640> those<00:04:33.910> foundations<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.810> they<00:04:34.870> both

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
both of those foundations and they both

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.860 
both of those foundations and they both
work<00:04:35.290> really<00:04:35.530> good<00:04:35.920> for<00:04:36.160> me<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:36.550> not<00:04:36.670> sure

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
work really good for me so I'm not sure

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.200

really<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.260> stability<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.610> foundation

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
really the stability of the foundation

really the stability of the foundation
with<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.420> primer<00:04:40.840> like<00:04:41.320> if<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.620> makes<00:04:41.830> a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
with the primer like if that makes a

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.250 
with the primer like if that makes a
difference<00:04:42.300> as<00:04:43.300> far<00:04:43.360> as<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.750> product<00:04:43.990> goes

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
good the only thing that I don't really

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.120 
good the only thing that I don't really
care<00:05:00.130> about<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.610> like<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.210> twist<00:05:01.480> up<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
care about is like the twist up and the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.370 
care about is like the twist up and the
brush<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.670> product<00:05:04.060> took<00:05:04.240> forever<00:05:04.510> actually

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
brush the product took forever actually

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.740 
brush the product took forever actually
to<00:05:05.500> come<00:05:05.680> out<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.460> brush<00:05:06.670> like<00:05:07.300> i<00:05:07.450> SAT

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
to come out of the brush like i SAT

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.990 
to come out of the brush like i SAT
there<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.020> twisted<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.650> like<00:05:09.070> 50<00:05:09.760> times

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
there and twisted it like 50 times

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.300 
there and twisted it like 50 times
before<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.840> product<00:05:11.200> would<00:05:11.320> come<00:05:11.560> out<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.220> I'm

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
before the product would come out so I'm

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.460 
before the product would come out so I'm
not<00:05:12.430> sure<00:05:12.850> really<00:05:13.210> how<00:05:13.390> much<00:05:13.690> product<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.260> in

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
not sure really how much product is in

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.190 
not sure really how much product is in
there<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.580> says<00:05:15.850> point<00:05:16.330> five<00:05:16.780> fluid

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
there and it says point five fluid

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.910 
there and it says point five fluid
ounces<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:19.720> know<00:05:19.810> I'm<00:05:20.320> sure<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.830> will

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
ounces so you know I'm sure that will

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.550 
ounces so you know I'm sure that will
last<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.250> forever<00:05:21.430> but<00:05:22.330> definitely<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:23.350> think

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
last you forever but definitely I think

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.500 
last you forever but definitely I think
it's<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:24.040> must-have<00:05:24.370> especially<00:05:25.060> for<00:05:25.270> summer

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's a must-have especially for summer

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.170 
it's a must-have especially for summer
just<00:05:25.810> really<00:05:26.230> evens<00:05:26.560> out<00:05:26.680> your<00:05:26.740> skin<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.550> like

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
I said I normally just use one of them

stuff<00:06:08.590> from<00:06:08.710> physicians<00:06:09.130> formula<00:06:09.580> from<00:06:09.940> the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
stuff from physicians formula from the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.290

last<00:06:10.300> sale<00:06:10.570> that<00:06:10.780> they<00:06:10.930> had<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.710> if<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:11.950> see

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
last sale that they had so if you see

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.640 
last sale that they had so if you see
review<00:06:13.300> after<00:06:13.450> review<00:06:13.630> on<00:06:14.110> physicians

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
review after review on physicians

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.980 
review after review on physicians
formula<00:06:14.890> that's<00:06:15.430> why<00:06:15.669> just<00:06:16.390> been<00:06:16.540> trying<00:06:16.750> the

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
formula that's why just been trying the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.750 
formula that's why just been trying the
things<00:06:17.200> out<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.620> seeing<00:06:17.860> what's<00:06:18.160> worth<00:06:18.340> the

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
things out and seeing what's worth the

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.510 
things out and seeing what's worth the
money<00:06:18.910> that<00:06:19.210> they<00:06:19.300> do<00:06:19.360> charge<00:06:19.720> and<00:06:20.110> what's<00:06:20.290> not

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
money that they do charge and what's not

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.580 
money that they do charge and what's not
because<00:06:21.520> this<00:06:21.940> physicians<00:06:22.660> formula<00:06:22.930> is<00:06:23.290> more

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
because this physicians formula is more

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.170 
because this physicians formula is more
of<00:06:23.680> an<00:06:23.800> expensive<00:06:24.660> drugstore<00:06:25.660> brand<00:06:25.960> so<00:06:26.620> I<00:06:27.180> was
