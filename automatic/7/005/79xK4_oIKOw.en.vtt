hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> what's<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.319> on<00:00:01.410> its<00:00:01.560> precision

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey guys what's going on its precision

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.830 
hey guys what's going on its precision
here<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.520> today<00:00:03.030> i'm<00:00:03.240> playing<00:00:03.360> some<00:00:03.659> more

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
here and today i'm playing some more

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.289 
here and today i'm playing some more

labs<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.960> i<00:00:07.200> left<00:00:07.560> off<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.059> this<00:00:09.059> room<00:00:09.420> here

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
labs video i left off in this room here

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.709 
labs video i left off in this room here
which<00:00:09.900> i<00:00:10.050> nicknamed<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.620> blue<00:00:10.860> room<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.719> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
which i nicknamed the blue room or the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.900 
which i nicknamed the blue room or the
gravity<00:00:13.440> alteration<00:00:13.980> rumors<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> gravity

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
gravity alteration rumors of the gravity

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.689 
gravity alteration rumors of the gravity
generator<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> other<00:00:15.839> end<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.440> now<00:00:17.340> as

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
generator at the other end here now as

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.269 
generator at the other end here now as
you<00:00:18.150> guys<00:00:18.420> saw<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> exit<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.410> over<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you guys saw the exit was over here and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.620 
you guys saw the exit was over here and
i<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.369> now<00:00:20.640> added<00:00:20.880> another<00:00:21.240> room<00:00:21.449> which

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
i have now added another room which

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
i have now added another room which
works<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.680> gravity<00:00:23.039> generator<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.699> let

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
works with this gravity generator so let

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.839 
works with this gravity generator so let
me<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.240> uh<00:00:25.220> enter<00:00:26.220> through<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.550> room<00:00:26.730> here

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
me just uh enter through this room here

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330 
me just uh enter through this room here
time<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.180> hadn't<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> guys<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.340> which

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
time I hadn't so you guys can see which

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880 
time I hadn't so you guys can see which
way<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> gravity<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.359> there's<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
way the gravity is so there's the on a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.700 
way the gravity is so there's the on a
ladder<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.880> you'll<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.510> fail<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
ladder that you'll take if you fail but

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
ladder that you'll take if you fail but
you'll<00:00:34.860> come<00:00:34.890> down<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> i'll<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.630> show

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you'll come down here and i'll just show

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.240 
you'll come down here and i'll just show
you<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> room<00:00:37.020> quickly<00:00:37.200> before<00:00:37.500> doing<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you the room quickly before doing it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
you the room quickly before doing it
this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.899> room<00:00:40.649> i<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.010> i've<00:00:41.100> nicknamed

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
this is the room i will i've nicknamed

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
this is the room i will i've nicknamed
it<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> helix<00:00:42.149> room<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.710> only<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it the helix room because not only is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400 
it the helix room because not only is
the<00:00:44.489> gravity<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> rotating<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.140> these

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the gravity of rotating but these

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
the gravity of rotating but these
platforms<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.640> also<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.270> their<00:00:48.450> own

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
platforms here are also on their own

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
platforms here are also on their own
motor<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> navigate<00:00:50.219> your<00:00:50.579> way

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
motor now you have to navigate your way

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
motor now you have to navigate your way
across<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.480> platforms<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
across these platforms to get to this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
across these platforms to get to this
one<00:00:53.129> exit<00:00:53.579> door<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.390> actually

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
one exit door here now this actually

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.450 
one exit door here now this actually
isn't<00:00:54.809> us<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.379> difficult<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> thought<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
isn't us as difficult as I thought it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
isn't us as difficult as I thought it
would<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.660> still<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.649> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
would be but it's still kind of a really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
would be but it's still kind of a really
quite<00:00:59.520> cool<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.390> works<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
quite cool how it all works now this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
quite cool how it all works now this
room<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> purple<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> color

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
room is purple because I like the color

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.630 
room is purple because I like the color
and<00:01:04.110> let<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.430> I'll

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and let me just get in here and I'll

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
and let me just get in here and I'll
show<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:07.080> done<00:01:07.340> really<00:01:08.340> really

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
show you how it's done really really

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
show you how it's done really really
quickly<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.880> let<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.240> turn<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.540> hot<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.840> turn

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
quickly so let me turn my hot on turn

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.130 
quickly so let me turn my hot on turn
the<00:01:10.400> jetpack<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:12.600> looks<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:13.020> are

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the jetpack off now looks like these are

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
the jetpack off now looks like these are
actually<00:01:13.350> line<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.650> quite<00:01:13.950> nicely<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.430> me<00:01:14.460> now

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
actually line up quite nicely for me now

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.740 
actually line up quite nicely for me now
if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> notice<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.460> these<00:01:17.479> other<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
if you notice that the these other this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
if you notice that the these other this
motor<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.110> rotating<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.040> opposite<00:01:20.549> direction

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
motor is rotating the opposite direction

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.170 
motor is rotating the opposite direction
of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> gravity<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.740> why

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
of the gravity is so that's why

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
of the gravity is so that's why
everything<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.689> left<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
everything is going to my left but the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
everything is going to my left but the
gravity<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.140> can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
gravity is going to my right so I can

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.130 
gravity is going to my right so I can
kind<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> cancel<00:01:29.220> itself<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
kind of cancel itself out but at the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
kind of cancel itself out but at the
same<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> doesn't<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.909> i'm<00:01:33.240> trying

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
same time it doesn't really i'm trying

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
same time it doesn't really i'm trying
to<00:01:33.540> make<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.659> ma<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.500> can't<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to make is ma I can't get up that in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.399 
to make is ma I can't get up that in
time<00:01:35.610> okay<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> rotate

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
time okay so I'm just kind of to rotate

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
time okay so I'm just kind of to rotate
around<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.759> said

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
around on this for a bit and like i said

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
around on this for a bit and like i said
this<00:01:39.060> actually<00:01:39.420> isn't<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:40.020> difficult<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:41.040> i

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this actually isn't as difficult as i

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
this actually isn't as difficult as i
would<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.670> liked<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.329> been<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.290> at

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
would have liked it to have been but at

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
would have liked it to have been but at
the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.710> time<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.100> still<00:01:44.340> extremely<00:01:45.030> cool

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the same time was still extremely cool

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.740 
the same time was still extremely cool
to<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.840> mess<00:01:46.259> around<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.659> here's<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to just mess around on and here's a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
to just mess around on and here's a
really<00:01:49.320> weird<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> feeling<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> sing<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really weird kind of feeling to sing the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
really weird kind of feeling to sing the
whole<00:01:51.509> room<00:01:52.439> start<00:01:53.130> twisting<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.790> turning

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
whole room start twisting and turning

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
whole room start twisting and turning
around<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:55.979> failed<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
around you all know i failed that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.600 
around you all know i failed that
because<00:01:56.790> i<00:01:56.850> spoke<00:01:57.420> too<00:01:57.719> soon<00:01:58.369> anyways<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
because i spoke too soon anyways if you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.420 
because i spoke too soon anyways if you
do<00:01:59.759> fail<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.270> only<00:02:00.810> did<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.430> entrance

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
do fail I only did put one entrance

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
do fail I only did put one entrance
there<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.119> fault<00:02:03.329> i<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.689> add<00:02:03.840> more

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
there which is my fault i might add more

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.959 
there which is my fault i might add more
i<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.130> by<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.340> side<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
i just going in by the side so it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
i just going in by the side so it
shouldn't<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.299> too<00:02:06.450> difficult<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.799> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
shouldn't be all too difficult but you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.990 
shouldn't be all too difficult but you
just<00:02:07.890> gotta<00:02:08.160> wait<00:02:08.280> till<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> gravity<00:02:08.910> comes

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
just gotta wait till the gravity comes

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
just gotta wait till the gravity comes
around<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.509> anyway

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
around right now anyway

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.430 
around right now anyway
which<00:02:11.560> isn't<00:02:11.980> too<00:02:12.100> big<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.580> deal<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.870> kind

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440

gravity<00:02:17.560> kicking<00:02:18.220> there<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.520> go<00:02:18.670> oh<00:02:19.260> yeah<00:02:20.260> it's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
gravity kicking there we go oh yeah it's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.620 
gravity kicking there we go oh yeah it's
slowly<00:02:21.490> got<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.240> gotta

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
slowly got up and there you just gotta

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.870 
slowly got up and there you just gotta
calm<00:02:22.840> bladder<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.560> said<00:02:23.830> before<00:02:24.070> this

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
calm bladder like I said before this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.670 
calm bladder like I said before this
will<00:02:25.030> lead<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.270> back<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.630> hallway<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
will lead you back to the hallway and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.480 
will lead you back to the hallway and
then<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:28.390> pop<00:02:28.720> out<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.380> go<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.980> way<00:02:30.220> I'm

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
then you pop out and you go this way I'm

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.770 
then you pop out and you go this way I'm
put<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> light<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.270> actually<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.660> guys

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
put a light here actually so you guys

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
put a light here actually so you guys
know<00:02:32.140> which<00:02:32.260> way<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.500> go<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.550> good<00:02:33.760> and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
know which way to go there you good and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.430 
know which way to go there you good and
then<00:02:34.210> you'll<00:02:34.360> fall<00:02:34.600> down<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.290> can

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
then you'll fall down and then you can

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120 
then you'll fall down and then you can
start<00:02:35.740> again<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> basis<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.710> this

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
start again and that's the basis of this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.890 
start again and that's the basis of this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
quite simple and when you do make it to

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.610 
quite simple and when you do make it to
the<00:03:24.310> end<00:03:24.489> here<00:03:24.640> which<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.959> line<00:03:26.140> up<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.410> many

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the end here which I can line up in many

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.590 
the end here which I can line up in many
many<00:03:26.890> different<00:03:27.040> ways<00:03:27.400> or<00:03:27.640> turn<00:03:27.820> oops<00:03:28.060> okay

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
many different ways or turn oops okay

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.060 
many different ways or turn oops okay
that<00:03:28.780> Jeff<00:03:29.110> night<00:03:29.290> wasn't<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> right<00:03:29.709> way<00:03:29.860> for

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
that Jeff night wasn't the right way for

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.290 
that Jeff night wasn't the right way for
the<00:03:30.130> gravity<00:03:30.430> be<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:32.380> quite<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:33.300> weird

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the gravity be it's really quite a weird

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.460 
the gravity be it's really quite a weird
getting<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.870> gravity<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.290> when<00:03:35.380> you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
getting you to the gravity but when you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.870 
getting you to the gravity but when you
get<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.739> here<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.130> gravity<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.519> normal

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
get out of here the gravity is normal

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.170 
get out of here the gravity is normal
and<00:03:37.030> I'm<00:03:37.540> yet<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.810> build<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.350> next<00:03:38.769> room<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
and I'm yet to build the next room but

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.670 
and I'm yet to build the next room but
this<00:03:40.570> actually<00:03:40.690> looks<00:03:40.930> really<00:03:41.050> big<00:03:41.410> from<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
this actually looks really big from the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.949 
this actually looks really big from the
outside<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.030> all<00:03:43.239> just<00:03:43.780> those

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
outside of like this is all just those

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.449 
outside of like this is all just those
two<00:03:44.200> puzzles<00:03:44.620> together<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.070> there's<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.310> happy

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
two puzzles together and there's a happy

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
two puzzles together and there's a happy
face<00:03:45.730> from<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.390> last<00:03:46.690> video<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.080> lights

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
face from the last video and the lights

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.720 
face from the last video and the lights
as<00:03:47.440> well<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.739> actually<00:03:47.890> delete<00:03:48.310> them<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
as well I'm actually delete them so it

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.240 
as well I'm actually delete them so it
doesn't<00:03:49.000> lag<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.360> much<00:03:49.739> but<00:03:50.739> I'll<00:03:50.950> leave<00:03:51.100> this

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
doesn't lag as much but I'll leave this

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.560 
doesn't lag as much but I'll leave this
here<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.820> want<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.030> thank<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.360> guys<00:03:52.420> for

here and I want to thank you guys for

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.410 
here and I want to thank you guys for
watching<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.070> guys<00:03:54.130> next<00:03:54.519> time
