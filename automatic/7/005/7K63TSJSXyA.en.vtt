um this is a really good color match for
me<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:12.190> um<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.989> does<00:03:14.200> oxidize<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
me actually um and it does oxidize a

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.080 
me actually um and it does oxidize a
little<00:03:15.670> bit<00:03:15.819> um<00:03:16.319> throughout<00:03:17.319> your<00:03:17.530> day<00:03:18.090> so

finish so you don't need any setting
powder<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.290> can't<00:03:27.040> imagine<00:03:27.160> anyone<00:03:27.760> needing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
powder I can't imagine anyone needing

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.970 
powder I can't imagine anyone needing
setting<00:03:28.449> powder<00:03:28.629> with<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:32.590> brush

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
setting powder with this but this brush

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.629 
setting powder with this but this brush
works<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.940> well<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.840> purpose<00:03:35.079> um

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
works really well for this purpose um

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.479 
works really well for this purpose um
yeah<00:03:36.639> it<00:03:37.209> has<00:03:37.599> though<00:03:38.109> I<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.889> use<00:03:39.250> one

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
yeah it has though I like I use one

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.479 
yeah it has though I like I use one
that's<00:03:39.760> also<00:03:40.090> like<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.510> flap<00:03:41.109> but<00:03:41.650> rounded<00:03:42.190> um

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
that's also like a flap but rounded um

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.640 
that's also like a flap but rounded um
that<00:03:43.150> one's<00:03:43.299> got<00:03:43.480> shorter<00:03:43.900> bristles<00:03:44.349> like

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
that one's got shorter bristles like

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.189 
that one's got shorter bristles like
about<00:03:44.949> this<00:03:45.250> length<00:03:45.639> all<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.389> way<00:03:46.480> all<00:03:46.510> around

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
about this length all the way all around

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:52.020 
about this length all the way all around
it<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:48.250> find<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.879> I<00:03:48.970> can<00:03:49.209> get<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:50.760> just<00:03:51.760> it's

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
it I find that I can get that just it's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.240 
it I find that I can get that just it's
easier<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.449> use<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.349> ones<00:03:53.560> with<00:03:53.739> these<00:03:53.889> longer

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
easier to use the ones with these longer

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.920 
easier to use the ones with these longer
bristles<00:03:54.639> aren't<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.090> easy<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.540> know<00:03:55.660> it's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
bristles aren't so easy you know it's

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.740 
bristles aren't so easy you know it's
they're<00:03:56.349> harder<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.709> maneuver<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.519> anyhow<00:03:58.389> let

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
they're harder to maneuver so anyhow let

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.629 
they're harder to maneuver so anyhow let
me<00:03:58.840> finish<00:03:58.989> this<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.409> here<00:03:59.849> my<00:04:00.849> forehead<00:04:01.449> and

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
me finish this up here my forehead and

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.210 
me finish this up here my forehead and
we'll<00:04:03.639> be<00:04:03.760> done<00:04:04.169> like<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.319> quicker<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.949> work

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
we'll be done like the quicker you work

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.159 
we'll be done like the quicker you work
the<00:04:06.609> more<00:04:06.940> you're<00:04:07.269> going<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.510> get<00:04:07.690> out<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.930> this

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
the more you're going to get out of this

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.229 
the more you're going to get out of this
so<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.530> spreads<00:04:08.859> really<00:04:09.430> fast<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.909> easy<00:04:10.060> but

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
so it spreads really fast and easy but

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.110 
so it spreads really fast and easy but
you<00:04:10.269> have<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.780> do<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.019> quickly<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:13.000> know

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
you have to do it quickly so you know

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.030 
you have to do it quickly so you know
the<00:04:13.479> slower<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.900> are<00:04:14.199> the<00:04:14.470> more<00:04:14.620> product

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
the slower you are the more product

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.349 
the slower you are the more product
you're<00:04:15.190> going<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> use<00:04:15.639> that's<00:04:16.000> how<00:04:16.209> this

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
you're going to use that's how this

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.219 
you're going to use that's how this
works<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:18.370> know<00:04:18.489> one<00:04:19.419> or<00:04:19.599> two<00:04:19.720> sprays<00:04:20.019> on
