00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.179
 there are very welcome to the channel 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 android in the vein 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.090
 in today's video let's talk a little 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 how did the first mobile game 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.130
 today it is very common people using 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.070
 phones as a source of fun and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 entertainment through the most varied 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 types of games ranging from the most 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.290
 simple to the most complex 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.260
 in great console titles 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.480
 opening the place tour shop is possible 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.800
 find a very large diversity 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 of games 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 many of them can be downloaded 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 free 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.840
 But you know how it all started in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 reality was good. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 different 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.780
 there were no app stores and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.729
 much less games 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 but in 1994 a German company called 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.189
 radio has released a cell phone with the name of mt 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 2000 the device came with a game 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.710
 embedded similar to tetris 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 mt 2000 is considered the first 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 phone with a game available for your 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 users 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.780
 talking about the game it was developed in 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.210
 language to be done with graphics 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.030
 monochromatic polyphonic sounds and phases 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 almost identical to the original game 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.820
 even being simple game presented 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.610
 many bugs that have been fixed 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.909
 subsequently by the manufacturer 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.220
 users could play approximately 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.700
 one hour until the appliance is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.850
 and it seems that in relation to this 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.430
 things have not changed much in the past. 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.009
 most modern cell phones we face 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.950
 battery life problems during 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.340
 the use of games and more 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 heavy but that's a subject for another 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 video 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.750
 going back to our history mt 2000 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.350
 I brought some more innovations like 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.770
 front 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.440
 and software that the German company 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.720
 pioneered and left behind the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.870
 nokia and motorola giants 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.300
 but made several mistakes like the game 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.430
 which has fallen under copyright law and 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.190
 she was forced to pay a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.400
 sold to the creators of the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.970
 game tetris lack of experience or 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.630
 planning failed to find this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.090
 is not easy but the fact is that the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.310
 cell phone did not succeed 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.160
 it seems that pioneering was not 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.280
 sufficient to be highlighted in the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.670
 but we certainly can not 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.430
 to forget the importance of the mt 2000 for 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.850
 the history of mobile games 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 shortly afterwards the German company was 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 sold and today is little remembered since 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.270
 obfuscated by nokia's response to mt 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.550
 2000 with snake game that ended 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.530
 shipped 350 million mobile phones 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.620
