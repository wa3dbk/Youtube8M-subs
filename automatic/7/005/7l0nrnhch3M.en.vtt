00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
farm basics time today we wanted to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.099 
farm basics time today we wanted to
discuss<00:00:19.490> banding<00:00:20.490> versus<00:00:21.109> broadcasting

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
discuss banding versus broadcasting

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.810 
discuss banding versus broadcasting
because<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.560> you're<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> non<00:00:23.010> farmer<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.670> might

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because if you're a non farmer you might

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
because if you're a non farmer you might
say<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.250> don't<00:00:26.490> know

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
say what is this I I don't I don't know

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
say what is this I I don't I don't know
what<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.119> farmers<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.599> doing<00:00:27.960> because

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
what these farmers are doing because

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.870 
what these farmers are doing because
they<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.439> different<00:00:28.650> types<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> machines<00:00:29.369> out

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
they see different types of machines out

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
they see different types of machines out
there<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.480> fertilizer<00:00:31.019> application<00:00:31.800> why

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
there for fertilizer application why

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.790 
there for fertilizer application why
well<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.420> fertilizing<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:34.020> lawn<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
well if you're fertilizing your lawn you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740 
well if you're fertilizing your lawn you
need<00:00:34.950> fertilizer<00:00:35.360> everywhere<00:00:36.360> because

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
need fertilizer everywhere because

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
need fertilizer everywhere because
there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> plant<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.739> every<00:00:38.250> square<00:00:38.610> inch<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
there's a plant on every square inch of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520 
there's a plant on every square inch of
your<00:00:39.210> yard<00:00:39.480> hopefully<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
your yard hopefully so you're going to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
your yard hopefully so you're going to
know<00:00:40.800> yeah<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.520> better<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.969> least<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
know yeah there better be at least so

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
know yeah there better be at least so
you're<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.600> broadcast<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.530> fertilizer

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you're gonna broadcast the fertilizer

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.380 
you're gonna broadcast the fertilizer
that<00:00:44.040> means<00:00:44.340> spreading<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> everywhere<00:00:45.149> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that means spreading it everywhere so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
that means spreading it everywhere so
like<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.780> particular<00:00:45.960> field<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.680> can

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
like in this particular field you can

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
like in this particular field you can
certainly<00:00:46.980> broadcast<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> fertilizer

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
certainly broadcast the fertilizer

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
certainly broadcast the fertilizer
everywhere<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.410> even<00:00:49.920> layer<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
everywhere so there's an even layer of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.709 
everywhere so there's an even layer of
fertilizer<00:00:50.789> across<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> whole<00:00:51.480> field<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
fertilizer across the whole field and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
fertilizer across the whole field and
that's<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.260> fertility<00:00:52.890> always<00:00:53.280> used<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that's the way fertility always used to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
that's the way fertility always used to
be<00:00:53.699> done<00:00:53.879> however<00:00:54.449> many<00:00:54.960> farmers<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.649> going

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
be done however many farmers are going

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.040 
be done however many farmers are going
to<00:00:56.129> Bandung<00:00:56.820> fertilizer<00:00:57.300> where<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.840> they're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to Bandung fertilizer where if they're

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
to Bandung fertilizer where if they're
gonna<00:00:58.140> plant<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.620> crop<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:59.250> every<00:00:59.579> 30<00:00:59.940> inches

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
gonna plant a crop say every 30 inches

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
gonna plant a crop say every 30 inches
like<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:01.050> corn<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.710> our<00:01:01.800> soybeans<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> our

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
like our corn and our soybeans on our

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
like our corn and our soybeans on our
farm<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> planted<00:01:03.120> every<00:01:03.329> 30<00:01:03.660> inches

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
farm is planted every 30 inches

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
farm is planted every 30 inches
well<00:01:04.409> why<00:01:04.680> put<00:01:04.979> fertilizer<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
well why put fertilizer out in the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
well why put fertilizer out in the
middle<00:01:06.330> why<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.960> put<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.439> underneath

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
middle why not put it right underneath

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
middle why not put it right underneath
where<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.430> gonna<00:01:08.520> put<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> seed<00:01:09.180> there

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
where you're gonna put that seed there

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
where you're gonna put that seed there
are<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> lot<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> advantages<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.920> terms

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
are a lot of advantages to that in terms

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
are a lot of advantages to that in terms
of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> crop<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> gonna<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> better<00:01:12.720> job

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of the crop is gonna do a better job

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
of the crop is gonna do a better job
being<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.560> efficient<00:01:14.040> taking<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
being more efficient taking that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
being more efficient taking that
fertilizer<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.540> may<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.720> able<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> get

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
fertilizer in and you may be able to get

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
fertilizer in and you may be able to get
by<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:16.740> less<00:01:17.189> fertilizer<00:01:17.549> per<00:01:18.119> acre<00:01:18.330> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
by using less fertilizer per acre if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
by using less fertilizer per acre if
you're<00:01:18.869> banding<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> main<00:01:19.650> reason

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you're banding it and the main reason

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
you're banding it and the main reason
why<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.909> roots<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.420> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
why is because the roots are gonna be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
why is because the roots are gonna be
growing<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:22.200> hopefully<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.400> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
growing down hopefully if you have your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
growing down hopefully if you have your
water<00:01:23.850> table<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> roots<00:01:24.869> should<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
water table down the roots should be

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.920 
water table down the roots should be
growing<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> happens<00:01:27.570> they

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
growing down and when that happens they

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.810 
growing down and when that happens they
can<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.229> right<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> fertilizer<00:01:29.189> band<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can go right to that fertilizer band and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
can go right to that fertilizer band and
the<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> roots<00:01:30.630> work<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.140> soil<00:01:31.500> they

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the way that roots work in soil they

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.859 
the way that roots work in soil they
don't<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.400> sense<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.329> hey<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
don't just sense and know hey there's a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.179 
don't just sense and know hey there's a
bunch<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.140> fertilizer<00:01:34.500> over<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.009> gonna

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
bunch of fertilizer over there I'm gonna

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
bunch of fertilizer over there I'm gonna
go<00:01:35.400> send<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> bunch<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> roots<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
go send a bunch of roots over to get it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
go send a bunch of roots over to get it
no<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.530> happens<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.159> once<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.729> find<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
no what happens is once they find a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.780 
no what happens is once they find a
highly<00:01:40.170> fertile<00:01:40.439> area<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
highly fertile area then they put out a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
highly fertile area then they put out a
lot<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.119> roots<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> area<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
lot of roots in that area so you can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
lot of roots in that area so you can
really<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.009> we've<00:01:44.130> done<00:01:44.340> studies<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.909> our

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
really see it we've done studies in our

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
really see it we've done studies in our
own<00:01:45.090> lab<00:01:45.329> where<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.079> fertilizer<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
own lab where if we have fertilizer here

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.350 
own lab where if we have fertilizer here
and<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.189> fertilizer<00:01:47.670> over<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.270> there

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and no fertilizer over here and there

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
and no fertilizer over here and there
are<00:01:48.420> roots<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> both<00:01:48.930> places<00:01:49.229> you'll<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.280> once

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
are roots to both places you'll see once

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.830 
are roots to both places you'll see once
the<00:01:50.759> roots<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.450> area<00:01:51.509> where

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the roots get into that area where

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.730 
the roots get into that area where
there's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> fair<00:01:52.350> amount<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.619> fertilizer

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there's a fair amount of fertilizer

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
there's a fair amount of fertilizer
there's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> whole<00:01:53.880> bunch<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.259> expansion<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
there's a whole bunch more expansion of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.920 
there's a whole bunch more expansion of
root<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.310> anyway<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:56.759> point<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
root there so anyway my point is if the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
root there so anyway my point is if the
roots<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.469> intercepting<00:01:59.100> that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
roots are going to be intercepting that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
roots are going to be intercepting that
fertilizer<00:01:59.670> anyway<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.540> means<00:02:00.750> there's<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
fertilizer anyway that means there's a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
fertilizer anyway that means there's a
much<00:02:01.200> better<00:02:01.350> chance<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.310> recovery<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
much better chance for recovery this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
much better chance for recovery this
coming<00:02:03.630> year<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> other<00:02:04.409> big<00:02:04.890> reason<00:02:04.920> why

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
coming year and the other big reason why

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.730 
coming year and the other big reason why
banding<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.420> better<00:02:06.689> than<00:02:06.899> broadcasting<00:02:07.649> or

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
banding is better than broadcasting or

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.809 
banding is better than broadcasting or
at<00:02:07.799> least<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.520> lot<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
at least that's what a lot of

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
at least that's what a lot of
universities<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.539> show<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.899> because<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
universities will show is because you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.380 
universities will show is because you
have<00:02:10.470> less<00:02:10.679> tie<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.489> fertilizer<00:02:11.940> see

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
have less tie up on that fertilizer see

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.800 
have less tie up on that fertilizer see
in<00:02:12.510> soil<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.260> not

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
in soil it's not

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.500 
in soil it's not
just<00:02:13.959> dirt<00:02:14.500> soil<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.610> made<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.360> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
just dirt soil is actually made up of a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
just dirt soil is actually made up of a
lot<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.750> different<00:02:17.230> elements<00:02:17.770> or<00:02:17.890> basically

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
lot of different elements or basically

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
lot of different elements or basically
different<00:02:18.790> chemistry<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.540> field<00:02:19.780> so

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
different chemistry out in that field so

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
different chemistry out in that field so
when<00:02:20.440> you're<00:02:20.560> putting<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.160> fertilizer<00:02:21.790> like

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
when you're putting in fertilizer like

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.089 
when you're putting in fertilizer like
say<00:02:22.300> phosphorus<00:02:22.959> for<00:02:23.170> example<00:02:23.620> if<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.890> get

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
say phosphorus for example if you get

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.589 
say phosphorus for example if you get
phosphorus<00:02:24.610> fertilizer<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.150> want<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
phosphorus fertilizer you want that to

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.300 
phosphorus fertilizer you want that to
be<00:02:25.720> available<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.319> your<00:02:26.440> crop<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:27.099> if<00:02:27.190> your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
be available for your crop but if your

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.699 
be available for your crop but if your
soil<00:02:27.489> has<00:02:27.760> lots<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.180> calcium<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.170> many

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
soil has lots of calcium in it as many

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.800 
soil has lots of calcium in it as many
of<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> soils<00:02:30.280> do<00:02:30.430> across<00:02:30.760> our<00:02:30.910> country<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
of the soils do across our country that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.199 
of the soils do across our country that
calcium<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.560> easily<00:02:33.040> tie<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.340> phosphorus<00:02:34.000> up

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
calcium can easily tie the phosphorus up

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.720 
calcium can easily tie the phosphorus up
making<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.099> insoluble<00:02:36.099> in<00:02:36.220> water<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
making it insoluble in water and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
making it insoluble in water and
unavailable<00:02:37.569> for<00:02:38.080> plants<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:38.769> all

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
unavailable for plants you can have all

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650 
unavailable for plants you can have all
kinds<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.340> phosphorus<00:02:39.819> out<00:02:40.000> there<00:02:40.209> if<00:02:40.450> there's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
kinds of phosphorus out there if there's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
kinds of phosphorus out there if there's
way<00:02:40.840> too<00:02:40.900> much<00:02:41.200> calcium<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:42.069> could<00:02:42.190> tie<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
way too much calcium that could tie the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.309 
way too much calcium that could tie the
phosphorus<00:02:42.970> up<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.330> not<00:02:43.540> let<00:02:43.720> your<00:02:43.870> crop<00:02:44.080> get

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
phosphorus up and not let your crop get

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.050 
phosphorus up and not let your crop get
it<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.620> by<00:02:44.769> putting<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.310> phosphorus<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
it so by putting that phosphorus in a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.880 
it so by putting that phosphorus in a
concentrated<00:02:46.780> band<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.500> kind<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> like

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
concentrated band it's kind of like

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.400 
concentrated band it's kind of like
having<00:02:48.100> an<00:02:48.310> ice<00:02:48.549> cube<00:02:49.000> versus<00:02:49.750> having<00:02:49.930> crushed

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
having an ice cube versus having crushed

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.289 
having an ice cube versus having crushed
ice<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.010> crushed<00:02:51.280> ice<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.730> nice<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.150> get<00:02:52.239> a

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
ice the crushed ice is nice you get a

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.330 
ice the crushed ice is nice you get a
quick<00:02:52.569> reaction<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.620> cools<00:02:53.920> down<00:02:54.040> your

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
quick reaction it cools down your

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.580 
quick reaction it cools down your
beverage<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.569> doesn't<00:02:55.870> last<00:02:56.049> very<00:02:56.230> long

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
beverage but it doesn't last very long

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.259 
beverage but it doesn't last very long
that<00:02:56.830> ice<00:02:57.010> cube<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.580> gonna<00:02:57.730> last<00:02:58.000> much<00:02:58.209> longer

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that ice cube is gonna last much longer

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.600 
that ice cube is gonna last much longer
it's<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.470> your<00:02:59.650> fertility<00:02:59.980> band<00:03:00.430> if

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
it's just like your fertility band if

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.490 
it's just like your fertility band if
you<00:03:00.700> concentrate<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.569> fertilizer<00:03:02.049> it'll

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you concentrate that fertilizer it'll

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.830 
you concentrate that fertilizer it'll
last<00:03:02.680> much<00:03:03.040> longer<00:03:03.069> hold<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:04.090> much<00:03:04.299> longer

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
last much longer hold up much longer

against the tie up initially yeah but

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.949 
against the tie up initially yeah but
that's<00:03:07.000> especially<00:03:07.569> important<00:03:07.930> for

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that's especially important for

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.570 
that's especially important for

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
like nitrogen and sulfur those could be

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.370 
like nitrogen and sulfur those could be
broadcast<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.299> you're<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:19.780> going<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.049> gain<00:03:20.350> a

broadcast and you're not going to gain a

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.229 
broadcast and you're not going to gain a
lot<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.769> efficiency<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.670> go<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.940> band

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
lot of efficiency if you go to a band

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.819 
lot of efficiency if you go to a band
there<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:22.900> different<00:03:23.410> fertilizer

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
there so with different fertilizer

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.890 
there so with different fertilizer
products<00:03:24.310> farmers<00:03:25.030> will<00:03:25.209> use<00:03:25.420> different

you mentioned their brand with

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.569 
you mentioned their brand with

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
but by deep banding it farmers will

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.440 
but by deep banding it farmers will
actually<00:03:33.040> place<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.519> about<00:03:33.819> eight<00:03:34.060> or<00:03:34.239> ten

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
actually place it about eight or ten

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.690

about<00:03:56.530> 40<00:03:57.040> years<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.670> for<00:03:57.850> farmers<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.239> have

about 40 years so for farmers that have
the<00:03:59.019> equipment<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.530> deep<00:03:59.920> ban<00:04:00.280> fertilizer

many<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.630> them<00:04:01.780> are<00:04:01.870> going<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.350> just<00:04:02.680> for

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
many of them are going to it just for

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:03.449 
many of them are going to it just for
that<00:04:03.010> reason

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
that reason

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.580 
that reason
well<00:04:03.579> once<00:04:03.819> again<00:04:04.109> broadcasting<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.260> if<00:04:05.440> you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
well once again broadcasting is if you

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.319 
well once again broadcasting is if you
were<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.769> spread<00:04:06.220> fertilizer<00:04:06.459> across<00:04:07.120> an

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
entire field and banding is if you

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.479 
entire field and banding is if you
selectively<00:04:10.810> place<00:04:11.319> where<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.010> fertilizer
