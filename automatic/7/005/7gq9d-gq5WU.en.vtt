00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.490 

since<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.190> have<00:00:02.429> such<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> large<00:00:03.720> head<00:00:03.990> gasket<00:00:04.410> on

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
since I have such a large head gasket on

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.650 
since I have such a large head gasket on
here<00:00:04.710> which<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.730> probably<00:00:06.240> comparable

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
here which is probably comparable

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
here which is probably comparable
thickness<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:08.269> really<00:00:09.269> neat<00:00:10.910> gasket

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
thickness to this really neat gasket

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
thickness to this really neat gasket
that<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.300> made<00:00:14.150> for<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.740> large<00:00:17.029> 120cc<00:00:18.029> head<00:00:18.920> or

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that I made for this large 120cc head or

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.609 
that I made for this large 120cc head or
cylinder<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
cylinder that what I'm going to do is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.599 
cylinder that what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.039> down<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:25.400> I'll<00:00:26.400> pull

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I'm going to go down here and I'll pull

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.290 
I'm going to go down here and I'll pull
this<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> I'll<00:00:28.080> lower<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.560> base

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
this off and I'll lower this base

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
this off and I'll lower this base
probably<00:00:32.630> three<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.660> four<00:00:33.780> hundreds<00:00:34.290> maybe

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
probably three or four hundreds maybe

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.310 
probably three or four hundreds maybe
more<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.570> see<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.930> boost<00:00:37.110> my

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
more and see if I can boost my

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.080 
more and see if I can boost my
compression<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.000> also<00:00:42.350> probably

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
compression but that will also probably

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.130 
compression but that will also probably
decrease<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> top-end

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
decrease the top-end

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
decrease the top-end
maybe<00:00:50.239> then<00:00:51.239> I'll<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.690> through<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
maybe then I'll have to go through and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
maybe then I'll have to go through and
check<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.010> any<00:00:53.190> leaks<00:00:53.460> down

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
check and see if I've got any leaks down

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
check and see if I've got any leaks down
in<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.469> reason<00:00:55.620> why<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
in here this is one one reason why you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
in here this is one one reason why you
should<00:00:56.190> keep<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.460> engine<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.660> clean<00:00:58.020> at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
should keep your engine really clean at

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.970 
should keep your engine really clean at
all<00:00:58.350> times

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
all times

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
all times
because<00:00:59.879> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.059> keep<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.420> clean<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.989> all

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because if you keep it clean at all

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
because if you keep it clean at all
times<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:02.010> any<00:01:02.969> leaks<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
times if there's any leaks you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
times if there's any leaks you
know<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> didn't<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.220> anything<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
know that you didn't put anything on it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
know that you didn't put anything on it
and<00:01:06.170> something<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.200> ain't<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:12.380> my

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and something just ain't right and my

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.910 
and something just ain't right and my
problem<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.560> racing<00:01:16.560> key<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
problem is this racing key and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
problem is this racing key and
carburetors<00:01:17.490> working<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.180> nice<00:01:18.360> suck<00:01:18.960> oh

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
carburetors working really nice suck oh

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
carburetors working really nice suck oh
this<00:01:19.979> cost<00:01:20.250> me<00:01:20.430> quite<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.600> money

really want from this SP moto which I've
ordered<00:01:58.260> twice<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.830> has<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.980> command<00:01:59.490> it's

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
ordered twice and it has a command it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.230 
ordered twice and it has a command it's
a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.810> tiny<00:02:01.310> aluminum<00:02:02.310> block<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.940> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a little tiny aluminum block right here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.290 
a little tiny aluminum block right here
it<00:02:04.170> fits<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:05.280> part<00:02:05.550> of<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.850> only<00:02:05.970> inch

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
it fits one part of it it's only inch

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.389 
it fits one part of it it's only inch
tall<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> don't<00:02:07.830> know<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.070> don't<00:02:08.130> know<00:02:08.220> how

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
tall or I don't know I don't know how

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
tall or I don't know I don't know how
many<00:02:08.460> millimeters<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.350> fit<00:02:10.649> one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
many millimeters that is but it fit one

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.650 
many millimeters that is but it fit one
part<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> fits<00:02:11.490> here<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> other<00:02:12.330> part

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
part of it fits here and the other part

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.930 
part of it fits here and the other part
of<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.900> fits<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> top<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.490> what<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> does

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
of it fits on the top and what that does

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.040 
of it fits on the top and what that does
is<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> raises<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:17.490> bike<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:18.840> bit

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
is it raises the bike just a little bit

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.670 
is it raises the bike just a little bit
so<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.430> does<00:02:20.820> not<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:22.200> when<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> shot

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
so that it does not the when the shot

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.180 
so that it does not the when the shot
compresses<00:02:23.280> my<00:02:24.209> muffler<00:02:24.600> over<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.190> it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
compresses my muffler over here it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.920 
compresses my muffler over here it
doesn't<00:02:28.730> track<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.030> right<00:02:30.330> hand<00:02:30.540> side<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
taillight which it does every time a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.140 
taillight which it does every time a
little<00:02:33.480> bit<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.140> I've<00:02:37.230> got<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.530> NGK<00:02:39.380> racing

little bit and I've got my NGK racing
spark<00:02:42.150> plug<00:02:42.360> deal<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.790> my<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.300> off

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
spark plug deal up here my on and off

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.620 
spark plug deal up here my on and off
deal<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.530> fuel<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.970> fuel<00:02:51.180> lines<00:02:51.420> been

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
deal for the fuel the fuel lines been

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.210 
deal for the fuel the fuel lines been
rerouted<00:02:51.989> with<00:02:52.620> some<00:02:53.130> nice<00:02:55.070> filters<00:02:56.070> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
rerouted with some nice filters and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.340 
rerouted with some nice filters and
things<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> lot<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> done<00:03:00.350> except

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
things so a lot of this is done except

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.509 
things so a lot of this is done except
for<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.769> thing<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.250> worried

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
for the one thing I'm really worried

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.350 
for the one thing I'm really worried
about<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:04.250> I've<00:03:05.250> screwed<00:03:05.550> up<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> turn<00:03:06.000> signal

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
about is I've screwed up the turn signal

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.030 
about is I've screwed up the turn signal
somehow<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.280> electrics<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.489> my<00:03:08.760> weak<00:03:09.030> point

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
somehow and electrics is my weak point

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.860 
somehow and electrics is my weak point
as<00:03:11.040> far<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.280> grabbing<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.330> volt<00:03:12.540> meters

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
as far as grabbing I got the volt meters

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.180 
as far as grabbing I got the volt meters
and<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.320> all<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.590> stuff<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.130> don't

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and I have all that stuff but I don't

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.210 
and I have all that stuff but I don't
and<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.930> schematics<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.590> unless<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.190> can

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and the schematics but unless you can

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.890 
and the schematics but unless you can
read<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> schematics<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.269> know<00:03:18.420> exactly<00:03:18.720> how

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
read the schematics and know exactly how

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.170 
read the schematics and know exactly how
it<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:22.080> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.290> be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.710 

an<00:03:25.390> interesting<00:03:26.230> year<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.650> year<00:03:27.720> hopefully

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
an interesting year this year hopefully

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.970 
an interesting year this year hopefully
the<00:03:28.989> economy<00:03:29.170> will<00:03:29.439> get<00:03:29.590> better<00:03:31.500> gas<00:03:32.500> prices

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
the economy will get better gas prices

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.369 
the economy will get better gas prices
will<00:03:33.099> go<00:03:33.129> down<00:03:33.220> which<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.730> doubt<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:38.049> we'll<00:03:38.260> be

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
will go down which I doubt and we'll be

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.319 
will go down which I doubt and we'll be
off<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.819> hell<00:03:39.819> of<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.060> racing<00:03:40.959> season
