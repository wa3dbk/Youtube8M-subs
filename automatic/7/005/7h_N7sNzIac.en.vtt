00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
thought it was just a vibration with

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.110 
thought it was just a vibration with
this<00:00:09.389> summit<00:00:11.420> maybe<00:00:12.420> yeah

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
this summit maybe yeah

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.019 
this summit maybe yeah
like<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.360> having<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> vertex<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:17.029> did

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
like I was having with the vertex I did

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
like I was having with the vertex I did
have<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> vertex<00:00:18.750> tires<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.439> everything<00:00:20.039> on

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
have the vertex tires and everything on

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.650 
have the vertex tires and everything on
here<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.939> definitely<00:00:21.119> give<00:00:21.510> me

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here and that was definitely give me

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
here and that was definitely give me
some<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:22.470> vibration<00:00:24.619> get<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:25.769> different

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
some good vibration get some different

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
some good vibration get some different
tires<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
tires on here

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.370 
tires on here
he's<00:00:29.010> trying<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.670> see<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.230> get

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
he's trying them out see if the so get

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
he's trying them out see if the so get
the<00:00:31.500> vibration<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.300> still<00:00:33.600> getting<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the vibration and I'm still getting the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.959 
the vibration and I'm still getting the
vibration<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:35.730> Soni<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.239> low<00:00:36.450> speeds<00:00:37.969> seems

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
vibration and Soni at low speeds seems

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.440 
vibration and Soni at low speeds seems
like<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.270> high<00:00:39.420> speeds<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.960> evens<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
like at high speeds it evens out but

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.940 
like at high speeds it evens out but
anybody<00:00:42.450> tell<00:00:42.660> me<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.020> ever<00:00:43.260> saw<00:00:43.620> this

progress and I'm not a steering issue

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.910 
progress and I'm not a steering issue
that<00:02:07.620> when<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.250> straight<00:02:08.640> fun<00:02:09.410> as<00:02:10.410> soon<00:02:10.680> as<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
that when I go straight fun as soon as I

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
that when I go straight fun as soon as I
go<00:02:11.130> left<00:02:11.940> or<00:02:12.210> right

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
go left or right

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.910 
go left or right
oh<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.740> set<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.250> stop<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:17.370> thing<00:02:17.760> man

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
oh that I set this stop this thing man

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.730 
oh that I set this stop this thing man
kind<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> thought<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:24.920> aluminum<00:02:27.740> drive

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
kind of thought the aluminum drive

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
kind of thought the aluminum drive
shifts<00:02:29.160> where<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> front<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> summit

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
shifts where the front of the summit

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.940 
shifts where the front of the summit
will<00:02:30.960> not<00:02:31.260> work<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:33.180> can't<00:02:33.750> handle<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.290> angle

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
will not work it can't handle the angle

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.270 
will not work it can't handle the angle
I'm<00:02:35.850> assuming<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:39.120> funny<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.450> I

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
I'm assuming the thing it's funny that I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.210 
I'm assuming the thing it's funny that I
think<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.610> stage<00:02:42.120> backward<00:02:45.530> one<00:02:46.530> kind

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
think it really stage backward one kind

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.330 
think it really stage backward one kind
of<00:02:47.310> forward<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.720> away<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:49.709> lock<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
of forward right away it just lock the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.390 
of forward right away it just lock the
guys<00:02:50.580> with<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.420> power<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.100> both

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
guys with the power and this one both

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.940 
guys with the power and this one both
first<00:02:54.000> opens<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:54.959> work<00:02:55.140> both<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:55.709> this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
first opens in like at work both on this

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.970 
first opens in like at work both on this
one<00:02:56.220> side<00:02:56.570> tip<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.750> on<00:03:00.260> what<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.680> table<00:03:01.950> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
one side tip is on what this table is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.810 
one side tip is on what this table is
definitely<00:03:02.690> little<00:03:03.690> Walker<00:03:04.070> earlier

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.050 

probably<00:03:08.820> what's<00:03:09.209> happening<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> back

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.050 

I'm<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.140> vibration<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.620> before<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.550> put

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I'm a vibration like that before I put

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.150 
I'm a vibration like that before I put
these<00:03:18.269> new<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160

right<00:03:26.420> buddy<00:03:27.110> nephew<00:03:29.500> got<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.530> solution<00:03:31.480> hoping

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
right buddy nephew got a solution hoping

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.380 
right buddy nephew got a solution hoping
it's<00:03:32.600> not<00:03:32.720> nothing<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.500> diffs<00:03:34.240> or<00:03:35.240> to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
it's not nothing in the diffs or to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.980 
it's not nothing in the diffs or to
transmission<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:37.180> anybody<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.540> decided

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
transmission but anybody have decided

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.400 
transmission but anybody have decided
have<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.800> same<00:03:39.980> problem
