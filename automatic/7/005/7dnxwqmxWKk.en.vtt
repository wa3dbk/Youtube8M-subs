00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
think that it's a case of people it will

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.000 
think that it's a case of people it will
be<00:03:01.239> more<00:03:01.480> appealing<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> wider<00:03:02.859> audience

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010

there in my box

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.999 
there in my box
that's<00:03:33.370> bit<00:03:33.669> annoying<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:35.139> anyway<00:03:35.680> we'll

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
that's bit annoying and anyway we'll

because<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.620> did<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.889> at<00:03:41.979> the<00:03:42.009> edge<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.939> it<00:03:43.060> looks

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
because I did it at the edge so it looks

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.809 
because I did it at the edge so it looks
like<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.659> box<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.709> slightly<00:03:45.069> pulled<00:03:45.519> I'll
