oh<00:00:19.460> not<00:00:20.460> quite<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.880> many<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> ones<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.960> do

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
oh not quite that many but the ones I do

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
oh not quite that many but the ones I do
have<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:23.189> spruce<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.970> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
have I really spruce them up for this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.230 
have I really spruce them up for this
show<00:00:24.330> I've<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> chameleon<00:00:25.980> paint

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
show I've got a lot of chameleon paint

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
show I've got a lot of chameleon paint
got<00:00:27.240> an<00:00:27.390> eagle<00:00:27.720> pot<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> had<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
got an eagle pot here that I had one of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.749 
got an eagle pot here that I had one of
my<00:00:29.369> artist<00:00:29.820> friends<00:00:30.119> paint<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
my artist friends paint for me and I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
my artist friends paint for me and I
this<00:00:32.759> year<00:00:32.820> I've<00:00:33.290> converted<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> engines

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this year I've converted the engines

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
this year I've converted the engines
right<00:00:35.100> side<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> trikes<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.480> which

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
right side up on the trikes and which

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.700 
right side up on the trikes and which
gives<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> better<00:00:37.739> thrust<00:00:38.190> line<00:00:39.530> allows<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
gives it a better thrust line allows you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
gives it a better thrust line allows you
to<00:00:40.829> use<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> longer<00:00:41.340> prop<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> don't<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
to use a longer prop you don't have to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
to use a longer prop you don't have to
worry<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.440> prop<00:00:43.710> hitting<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> your

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
worry about the prop hitting the your

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.139 
worry about the prop hitting the your
ground<00:00:45.210> anymore<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> race<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ground anymore so I race that up and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
ground anymore so I race that up and
raise<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> thrust<00:00:48.690> line<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> lot

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
raise the thrust line then it's a lot

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
raise the thrust line then it's a lot
easier<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.219> takeoff<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.640> landings<00:00:57.559> yes

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
easier on takeoff and landings yes

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.549 
easier on takeoff and landings yes
they're<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:58.890> ultra<00:00:59.340> lights<00:00:59.520> 103<00:01:00.059> legal

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
they're all ultra lights 103 legal

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
they're all ultra lights 103 legal
I<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> filled<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.270> really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I like that filled in it's really

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
I like that filled in it's really
rewarding<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.470> trained

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
rewarding for me because I trained

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
rewarding for me because I trained
everybody<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.390> selling<00:01:09.750> trikes

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
everybody that I that I'm selling trikes

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.000 
everybody that I that I'm selling trikes
to<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.490> everybody<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.330> buys<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.350> usually

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
to so and everybody that buys it usually

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.200 
to so and everybody that buys it usually
hangs<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.729> quite<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.060> while

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hangs on to them for quite a while

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
hangs on to them for quite a while
there's<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.689> fun<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> fly<00:01:16.290> oh<00:01:24.200> yeah

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there's so much fun to fly oh yeah

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.750 
there's so much fun to fly oh yeah
well<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> takes<00:01:27.930> experience<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.130> fly<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.549> rough

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
well it takes experience to fly in rough

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.090 
well it takes experience to fly in rough
air<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.049> quite<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.680> experience

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
air and I have quite a bit of experience

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700 
air and I have quite a bit of experience
doing<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.060> live<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> mountains<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
doing that I live in the mountains and I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
doing that I live in the mountains and I
wouldn't<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.040> flying<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.850> wind<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.420> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
wouldn't be flying in in wind like it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
wouldn't be flying in in wind like it's
down<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> mountains<00:01:38.490> kids<00:01:38.670> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
down here up in the mountains kids of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
down here up in the mountains kids of
the<00:01:38.909> mechanical<00:01:39.810> turbulence<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.310> here

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the mechanical turbulence there but here

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.790 
the mechanical turbulence there but here
it's<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.820> straight-line<00:01:42.300> wind<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it's all straight-line wind and and as

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:59.359 
it's all straight-line wind and and as
you<00:01:44.550> can<00:01:44.700> fly<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> 15<00:01:45.869> 20<00:01:46.020> miles<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.530> hour<00:01:58.369> no

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you can fly in it 15 20 miles an hour no

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.310 
you can fly in it 15 20 miles an hour no
one<00:01:59.490> comes<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.940> like<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:05.570> yes<00:02:06.570> I'd<00:02:07.110> like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.810 
one comes just like this yes I'd like
for<00:02:07.470> him<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> come<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.610> some

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
for him to come in and have some

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.249 
for him to come in and have some
training<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.300> they're<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.600> already<00:02:09.810> trained

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
training if they're not already trained

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.830 
training if they're not already trained
I<00:02:10.590> don't<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.220> give<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> trike<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> somebody

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I don't like to give a trike to somebody

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
I don't like to give a trike to somebody
that<00:02:13.019> hasn't<00:02:13.200> been<00:02:13.440> trained<00:02:22.040> well<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.310> found

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that hasn't been trained well I found

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.110 
that hasn't been trained well I found
the<00:02:23.970> average<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.569> 15<00:02:24.959> hours<00:02:25.550> some<00:02:26.550> take<00:02:26.819> 10

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the average is 15 hours some take 10

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.509 
the average is 15 hours some take 10
some<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.750> 20<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:29.100> take<00:02:29.280> 25<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:31.519> I've

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
some take 20 some take 25 but I've

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.460 
some take 20 some take 25 but I've
trained<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.910> lot<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.180> general<00:02:33.540> aviation<00:02:33.630> pilots

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
trained a lot of general aviation pilots

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.770 
trained a lot of general aviation pilots
and<00:02:34.829> they<00:02:35.280> catch<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.180> fast

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and they catch on really fast

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:47.589 
and they catch on really fast
there<00:02:37.350> they're<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.310> 15<00:02:38.730> hour<00:02:38.970> average

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.569 

same<00:02:48.599> unit<00:02:48.959> with<00:02:49.110> different<00:02:49.470> engines<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.069> have

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
same unit with different engines I have

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.880 
same unit with different engines I have
four<00:02:51.209> different<00:02:51.329> engine<00:02:52.200> options<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.739> I'm

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
four different engine options that I'm

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.089 
four different engine options that I'm
using<00:02:53.069> right<00:02:53.340> now<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.079> wing<00:02:55.319> wings

using right now and and the wing wings

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.679 
using right now and and the wing wings
can<00:02:56.400> vary<00:02:56.640> from<00:02:57.030> two<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.390> three<00:02:57.420> different

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
can vary from two to three different
