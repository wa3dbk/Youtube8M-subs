strange<00:01:45.479> s<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.960> our<00:01:48.200> drug<00:01:49.220> cook<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> was

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
strange s was our drug cook and was

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
strange s was our drug cook and was

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
making twat nights for us so we've added

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289

appoint<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.280> new<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.030> why<00:01:54.149> we

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
appoint a new one but that's why we

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
appoint a new one but that's why we
still<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.689> quite<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> few<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.350> those<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.189> are

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
still have quite a few of those that are

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.230 
still have quite a few of those that are
uncombined<00:01:56.640> yet<00:01:57.060> about<00:01:57.659> 200<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.649> rations

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
uncombined yet about 200 water rations

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
uncombined yet about 200 water rations
left<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> well<00:02:01.649> drain<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
left and that's what the well drain so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.469 
left and that's what the well drain so
that's<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:02.790> we're<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.240> for

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that's about where we're going to be for

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.850 
that's about where we're going to be for
a<00:02:03.509> while<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> guess<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> other<00:02:04.680> thing

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
a while here I guess the other thing

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
a while here I guess the other thing
that<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.340> take<00:02:05.369> note<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.570> put

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that I would take note of is that we put

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
that I would take note of is that we put
all<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:07.619> man<00:02:07.890> bags<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.369> utility<00:02:08.789> belts

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
all of our man bags and utility belts

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
all of our man bags and utility belts

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and such in the bank every day so that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
anyone can use them at any time so we

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.730 
anyone can use them at any time so we

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
space that they can handle I also forgot

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.110 
space that they can handle I also forgot

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
attack that we could handle here in the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.500 
attack that we could handle here in the
odd<00:02:29.350> park<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.400> sorry<00:02:30.760> about<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.120> Gazette<00:02:31.480> and

missing that as you can maybe see I'm a
little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:34.990> behind<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.800> I'm<00:02:35.890> trying

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
might be a little bit shorter just to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.670 
might be a little bit shorter just to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.770 
in the town no deaths today which is
great<00:02:44.710> because<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.490> know<00:02:45.520> we've<00:02:45.880> had<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
great because as you know we've had a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
great because as you know we've had a

we'll be able to continue on with
without<00:02:56.290> any<00:02:56.500> deaths<00:02:56.770> for<00:02:57.100> several<00:02:57.490> more<00:02:57.610> days
