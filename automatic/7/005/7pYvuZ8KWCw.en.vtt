00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
gun of the on the top turn so it doesn't

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
gun of the on the top turn so it doesn't
fall<00:00:29.279> down<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.760> older<00:00:30.480> versions<00:00:32.239> also<00:00:33.239> they

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
fall down like older versions also they

fall down like older versions also they
put<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.440> its<00:00:34.620> new<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.579> put<00:00:35.790> springs

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
put I think its new but they put springs

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.860 
put I think its new but they put springs
on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> wheels<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.140> bounces<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:38.010> bit

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
on the wheels so it bounces a little bit

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.459 
on the wheels so it bounces a little bit
it<00:00:40.160> has<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> open<00:00:41.850> opening<00:00:42.570> hatch<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> top

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.819 

it's<00:02:24.569> pretty<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.439> he<00:02:25.500> should<00:02:25.709> get

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
it's pretty good I think he should get

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's pretty good I think he should get
it<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.519> lot<00:02:26.640> better<00:02:26.790> than<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> older

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it it's a lot better than the older

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.890 
it it's a lot better than the older
versions<00:02:27.750> especially<00:02:28.680> since<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.629> main<00:02:30.629> gun

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
versions especially since the main gun

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.509 
versions especially since the main gun
they<00:02:31.079> put<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> spring<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.799> there<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.340> won't

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
they put a spring on there so it won't

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.269 
they put a spring on there so it won't
fall<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.329> older<00:02:33.629> ones<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:36.000> it
