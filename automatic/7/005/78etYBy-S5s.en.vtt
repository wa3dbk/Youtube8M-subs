00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that last 300 so that was great to be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
honest I was a little bit iffy on the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
honest I was a little bit iffy on the
whole<00:03:02.160> idea<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.820> double<00:03:03.270> out<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.540> back<00:03:03.690> but

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
whole idea of a double out and back but

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.690 
whole idea of a double out and back but
but<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.410> was<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> much<00:03:04.770> much<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.430> enjoyable

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
but it was a much much more enjoyable

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
but it was a much much more enjoyable
course<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.300> thought<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.810> can

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
course and I thought and I can

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
course and I thought and I can
definitely<00:03:07.320> see<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.920> big<00:03:08.340> future<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
yeah well I was a bit of a slow start to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.199 
yeah well I was a bit of a slow start to
this<00:03:22.800> year<00:03:23.040> I've<00:03:23.160> done<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> lot<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.640> racing<00:03:24.060> last

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.120 
this year I've done a lot of racing last
year<00:03:24.480> probably<00:03:24.690> too<00:03:24.989> much<00:03:25.140> racing<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.920> worn

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
year probably too much racing and worn

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.130 
year probably too much racing and worn
myself<00:03:26.390> into<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.480> ground<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.780> little<00:03:27.870> bit<00:03:27.989> at

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
myself into the ground a little bit at

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.630 
myself into the ground a little bit at
the<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.530> was<00:03:28.590> really<00:03:28.860> crucial<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.400> I've

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the time it was really crucial so I've

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.120 
the time it was really crucial so I've
only<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.330> started<00:03:30.870> building<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.290> towards<00:03:31.709> a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
only just started building in towards a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.490 
only just started building in towards a
bit<00:03:32.580> more<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.910> peak<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.840> guess<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.200> eating

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
bit more of a peak I guess and eating

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.960 
bit more of a peak I guess and eating
getting<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> business<00:03:35.160> end<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.640> season

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
getting the business end of the season

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.570 
getting the business end of the season
now<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:37.290> national<00:03:37.709> cross<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.310> few<00:03:38.459> weeks

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
now so so national cross in a few weeks

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.640

will<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.880> big<00:03:39.060> focus<00:03:39.300> as<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.260> result<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.590> that

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
will be a big focus as a result of that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.259 
will be a big focus as a result of that
I'm<00:03:40.800> going<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.220> race<00:03:41.370> at<00:03:41.640> at<00:03:41.820> lab<00:03:42.060> and

I'm going to do the race at at lab and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.420 
I'm going to do the race at at lab and
park<00:03:42.450> rather<00:03:42.720> than<00:03:42.870> city2surf<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.680> year<00:03:43.920> to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
park rather than city2surf this year to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.770 
park rather than city2surf this year to
be<00:03:44.519> honest<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.790> thought<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.030> would<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.300> good

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
be honest I thought that would be a good

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.660 
be honest I thought that would be a good
chance<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.110> get<00:03:46.230> my<00:03:46.350> first<00:03:46.500> ever<00:03:46.740> xcr<00:03:47.280> win<00:03:47.460> but

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
chance to get my first ever xcr win but

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.980 
chance to get my first ever xcr win but
but<00:03:48.060> I've<00:03:48.150> managed<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.390> do<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.570> today<00:03:48.720> which<00:03:48.960> is

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
but I've managed to do it today which is

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.960 
but I've managed to do it today which is
nice<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.260> national<00:03:50.250> cross<00:03:50.400> maybe<00:03:50.640> look<00:03:50.820> at<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
nice so national cross maybe look at a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.650 
nice so national cross maybe look at a
fun<00:03:51.120> run<00:03:51.240> after<00:03:51.510> that

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
fun run after that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.510 
fun run after that
like<00:03:51.810> city<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.170> buy<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:52.710> get<00:03:53.160> back<00:03:53.310> into

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
like city to buy and then get back into
