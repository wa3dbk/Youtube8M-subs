 Ravensburg after exactly twelve minutes though 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 even before the break should be the answer 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.070
 the lions come martin weis from the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.369

 the first playoff goal for the homeowners 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.560
 into a turbulent second 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 Section It should have many punishment times 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.140
 on both sides give each checking 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.479
 dennis reimer and the lions afterwards 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 two man more on the ice 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.340
 and that you use from mazzolini of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 Which i miller the first fails 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.850
 but in the second try the trundles 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 slice over the line 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.950
 the first time leadership for the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 homeowners after 28 minutes played 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 hold 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.479
 three minutes later the tower stars in the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.039
 attack and of course radek krestan 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.049
 to compensate for 2 2 then this 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.090
 scene justin deer meets his 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.979
 in the face and gets 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.190
 for a game time is the after 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.860
 punishment for high stocks frankfurt 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.489
 by another penalty against henry 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.010
 martens, the lions were even two 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.230
 man less on the ice but she 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 defended the sensational and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.760
 survived this critical phase without 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.970
 Go ahead and were applauded with thunderous applause 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.160
 momentum was bühler frankfurter side 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.390
 martin baasch had this gang and the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.049
 stays cool 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.280
 32 goals in the eissport hall 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.500
 raging immediately after bad checking 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.410
 dennis reimer directly in front of frankfurter 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.140
 Bank and consequently 5 plus playing time 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.090
 for the ravensburger hans patty the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.459
 should play the lion in the cards 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.069
 nice move about richy müller and 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.010
 david elsner has an easy game 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.160
 the decision before no chance to defend 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.069
 for mathias treml and thus win the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.489
 travel with lions answering an incredibly 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.500
