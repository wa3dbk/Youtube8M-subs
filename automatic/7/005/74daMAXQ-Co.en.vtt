00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
competent that the cheap by comparison

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.100

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
sensational this is the first car that

sensational this is the first car that
takes<00:00:49.850> black<00:00:50.150> boxes<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.049> actually<00:00:51.440> adds<00:00:51.650> to

the enjoyment for the driver whereas the
Porsche<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.799> arguably<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.729> last<00:00:55.909> of<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
Porsche is arguably the last of the

old-school it still has a stick between

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.890 
old-school it still has a stick between
the<00:00:58.339> seats<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.879> makes<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.180> work<00:00:59.449> hard<00:00:59.780> for

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
the seats and it makes you work hard for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.840 
the seats and it makes you work hard for
its<00:01:00.080> performance<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.790> my

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
its performance but it is in my

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.609 
its performance but it is in my
experience<00:01:02.180> uniquely<00:01:02.900> rewarding<00:01:03.320> for<00:01:03.500> all

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
experience uniquely rewarding for all

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.530 
experience uniquely rewarding for all
that<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.040> here<00:01:04.250> we<00:01:04.339> are<00:01:04.369> we've<00:01:04.640> got<00:01:04.670> perhaps

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
that so here we are we've got perhaps

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.080 
that so here we are we've got perhaps
the<00:01:06.380> first<00:01:06.619> of<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.830> new<00:01:07.040> type<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.280> supercar<00:01:07.820> and

the first of a new type of supercar and

the first of a new type of supercar and
sadly<00:01:09.049> perhaps<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.560> last<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.860> an<00:01:09.950> old<00:01:10.159> type<00:01:10.369> of

we're<00:01:12.290> on<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.439> road<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.830> UK<00:01:13.220> I'm

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
we're on the road in the UK I'm

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.029 
we're on the road in the UK I'm
fascinated<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.780> find<00:01:14.840> out<00:01:15.229> how<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.799> turns

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
fascinated to find out how this turns

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.690 
fascinated to find out how this turns
out<00:01:17.200> like<00:01:18.200> all<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.619> best<00:01:18.770> designs<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.490> four

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
out like all the best designs the four

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.160 
out like all the best designs the four
five<00:01:19.880> eight<00:01:20.060> was<00:01:20.210> influenced<00:01:20.659> as<00:01:20.780> much<00:01:20.929> by

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
five eight was influenced as much by

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.940 
five eight was influenced as much by
function<00:01:21.799> as<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.609> was<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.789> need<00:01:23.090> for<00:01:23.119> prettiness

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
function as it was a need for prettiness

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950

compared<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.619> 430<00:01:28.130> point<00:01:28.670> three<00:01:28.939> four<00:01:29.179> so

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
compared to the 430 point three four so

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.270 
compared to the 430 point three four so
it's<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.509> slight<00:01:29.749> improvement<00:01:30.159> but<00:01:31.159> it's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's a slight improvement but it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.980 
it's a slight improvement but it's

the white German car because the white
German<00:06:17.280> car<00:06:17.550> sounds<00:06:17.880> more<00:06:18.030> authentic<00:06:18.630> the

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
German car sounds more authentic the

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.630 
German car sounds more authentic the
four<00:06:19.440> five<00:06:19.650> eighths<00:06:19.830> noise<00:06:20.040> is<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.220> little<00:06:20.490> bit

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
four five eighths noise is a little bit

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.530 
four five eighths noise is a little bit
synthetic<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.390> little<00:06:21.600> bit<00:06:21.690> synthesized<00:06:22.650> but

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
synthetic a little bit synthesized but

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:45.020 
synthetic a little bit synthesized but
I'm<00:06:24.540> splitting<00:06:24.990> hairs<00:06:25.170> here

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.370 

but<00:06:46.030> I<00:06:46.060> am<00:06:46.210> finding<00:06:46.480> it<00:06:46.630> quite<00:06:46.660> hard<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.110> fault

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
but I am finding it quite hard to fault

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.490 
but I am finding it quite hard to fault
it<00:06:47.470> I<00:06:47.590> know<00:06:47.710> it's<00:06:47.860> predictable<00:06:49.380> but<00:06:50.380> they<00:06:50.440> do

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
it I know it's predictable but they do

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.740 
it I know it's predictable but they do
come<00:06:50.770> at<00:06:50.860> subject<00:06:51.100> from<00:06:51.280> different<00:06:52.180> angles

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
come at subject from different angles

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.260 
come at subject from different angles
it's<00:06:52.990> really<00:06:53.440> really<00:06:53.920> surprising<00:06:54.640> but<00:06:55.210> the

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
it's really really surprising but the

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.310 
it's really really surprising but the
end<00:06:55.510> result<00:06:55.930> is<00:06:56.260> two<00:06:57.040> cars<00:06:57.340> that<00:06:57.700> are<00:06:58.480> very

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
end result is two cars that are very

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.280 
end result is two cars that are very
satisfying<00:07:00.010> to<00:07:00.220> drive<00:07:00.490> fast<00:07:01.480> and<00:07:01.750> slow

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
satisfying to drive fast and slow

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.370 
satisfying to drive fast and slow
they're<00:07:02.650> just<00:07:03.180> great<00:07:04.180> Road<00:07:04.480> costs<00:07:04.840> truly

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
they're just great Road costs truly

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.480 
they're just great Road costs truly
great<00:07:05.710> road<00:07:06.040> cars

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
great road cars

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.890 
great road cars
I<00:07:07.710> will<00:07:08.710> never<00:07:08.890> tire<00:07:09.250> of<00:07:09.640> just<00:07:10.270> doing<00:07:10.690> this

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
I will never tire of just doing this

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.940 
I will never tire of just doing this
though

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.760 

when<00:07:16.580> Evo<00:07:17.300> finally<00:07:17.780> figures<00:07:18.140> one<00:07:18.320> of<00:07:18.440> these<00:07:18.620> or

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
when Evo finally figures one of these or

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.230 
when Evo finally figures one of these or
when<00:07:18.920> someone<00:07:19.310> finally<00:07:19.580> figures<00:07:20.000> one<00:07:20.150> of

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
when someone finally figures one of

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.600 
when someone finally figures one of
these<00:07:20.390> it's<00:07:21.290> going<00:07:21.500> to<00:07:21.560> go<00:07:21.680> really<00:07:21.980> fast<00:07:22.340> I

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
these it's going to go really fast I

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.970 
these it's going to go really fast I
reckon<00:07:23.060> we're<00:07:23.300> looking<00:07:23.660> low<00:07:23.930> seven<00:07:24.350> to<00:07:24.440> 100

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:24.980

reckon we're looking low seven to 100
maybe<00:07:25.580> even<00:07:25.910> a<00:07:25.970> high<00:07:26.150> six<00:07:26.740> remember<00:07:27.740> first

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
maybe even a high six remember first

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.610 
maybe even a high six remember first
