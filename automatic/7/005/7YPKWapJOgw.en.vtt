stove<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:25.060> something<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.150> noticed<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.690> didn't

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
stove and something I noticed I didn't

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.740 
stove and something I noticed I didn't
see<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.440> their<00:02:27.590> directions<00:02:27.920> anywhere<00:02:28.750> but

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
see it in their directions anywhere but

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.290 
see it in their directions anywhere but
I<00:02:30.050> guess<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.709> cover<00:02:31.010> could<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.340> used<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:31.910> your

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
I guess this cover could be used as your

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.229 
I guess this cover could be used as your
dinner<00:02:32.510> plate<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.110> want<00:02:33.850> take<00:02:34.850> off<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
dinner plate if you want take off the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:43.800 
dinner plate if you want take off the
cover<00:02:37.269> pops<00:02:38.269> right<00:02:38.510> off<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.650> grill

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
cover pops right off this is the grill

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.770 
cover pops right off this is the grill
of<00:02:44.810> course<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.320> all<00:02:45.410> bright<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.709> shiny<00:02:45.980> now

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
of course it's all bright and shiny now

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.000 
of course it's all bright and shiny now
it's<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.989> going<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.290> ever<00:02:48.350> look<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.620> this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it's not going to ever look like this

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.150 
it's not going to ever look like this
again<00:02:49.160> once<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.700> use<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.120> I'm<00:02:50.269> sure<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.950> legs

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
again once I use it I'm sure to the legs

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.870 
again once I use it I'm sure to the legs
pulled<00:02:52.430> out<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.940> then<00:02:53.720> they<00:02:53.840> lock<00:02:54.049> into<00:02:54.350> place

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
pulled out and then they lock into place

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.250 
pulled out and then they lock into place
to<00:02:55.880> disengage<00:02:56.390> them<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.690> got<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.930> squeeze

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
to disengage them you got to squeeze

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.420 
to disengage them you got to squeeze
there<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:03.620> works

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
there just like that it works

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.310 
there just like that it works
horse<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.570> see<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:05.930> has<00:03:06.140> two<00:03:06.350> legs<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
horse you see it just has two legs the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.810 
horse you see it just has two legs the
biolite<00:03:09.880> stove<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.180> third<00:03:11.570> leg<00:03:12.579> just<00:03:13.579> like

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
biolite stove as a third leg just like

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.740 
biolite stove as a third leg just like
that<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.739> it's<00:03:16.010> actually<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.579> very<00:03:17.329> stable

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that and it's actually very very stable

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.250 
that and it's actually very very stable
once<00:03:18.500> it's<00:03:18.739> on<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.040> stove<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.660> got<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> port

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
once it's on the stove you got a port

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.520 
once it's on the stove you got a port
here<00:03:21.350> for<00:03:22.130> fuel<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.810> while<00:03:24.019> your<00:03:24.170> fire<00:03:24.380> is

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
here for fuel so while your fire is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.039 
here for fuel so while your fire is
going<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.519> can<00:03:25.579> lift<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.120> up<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.810> course

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
going you can lift this up of course

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.300 
going you can lift this up of course
it's<00:03:27.230> going<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.530> hot<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:27.980> you'll<00:03:28.100> want<00:03:28.280> to

that good stuff is gonna fall onto this
layer<00:04:09.830> this<00:04:10.830> comes<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.280> also<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:16.080> that

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
layer this comes out also and so that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.289 
layer this comes out also and so that
comes<00:04:16.769> out<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.190> could<00:04:17.310> soak<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.790> and

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
comes out so you could soak that and

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:26.650 
comes out so you could soak that and
some<00:04:18.570> water<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:22.410> piece<00:04:22.710> here

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.020

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
now I'm a little concerned you know a

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.610 
now I'm a little concerned you know a
lot<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.450> drippings<00:04:30.870> gonna<00:04:31.140> get<00:04:31.350> through

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
lot of the drippings gonna get through

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.590 
lot of the drippings gonna get through
the<00:04:31.740> holes<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.570> layer<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:35.790> really

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
the holes of this layer you have really

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.510 
the holes of this layer you have really
fatty<00:04:36.870> hamburgers<00:04:37.470> or<00:04:37.650> something<00:04:37.980> just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
fatty hamburgers or something just

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.430 
fatty hamburgers or something just
picturing<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.150> grease<00:04:39.360> coming<00:04:39.720> here<00:04:40.230> and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
picturing the grease coming here and

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.150 
picturing the grease coming here and
going<00:04:41.100> down<00:04:41.400> into<00:04:41.640> your<00:04:41.850> stove<00:04:42.919> which<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.130> a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
going down into your stove which is a

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.659 
going down into your stove which is a
little<00:04:44.490> more<00:04:44.640> difficult<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.180> clean<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.830> we'll

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
little more difficult to clean so we'll

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.390 
little more difficult to clean so we'll
see<00:04:47.880> how<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.150> goes

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
see how that goes

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.350 
see how that goes
test<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.730> put<00:04:51.450> up<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.660> video<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.200> that

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
test and put up a video of that

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.500 
test and put up a video of that
pretty<00:04:54.360> soon<00:04:54.600> this<00:04:55.590> last<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.100> worry<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.270> I

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
pretty soon this last one worry that I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.500 
pretty soon this last one worry that I
have<00:04:57.540> but<00:04:58.110> maybe<00:04:58.260> well<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:59.240> get<00:05:00.240> around

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
have but maybe well you can get around

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.570 
have but maybe well you can get around
that<00:05:00.720> by<00:05:00.990> putting<00:05:01.200> some<00:05:01.440> tin<00:05:01.650> foil<00:05:01.919> in<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.490> or

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
that by putting some tin foil in here or

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.450 
that by putting some tin foil in here or
something<00:05:03.060> not<00:05:03.419> sure<00:05:03.720> yet<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.250> anyway<00:05:05.250> we'll

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
something not sure yet but anyway we'll

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.870 
something not sure yet but anyway we'll
see<00:05:05.490> how<00:05:05.760> it<00:05:05.880> goes<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:06.390> as<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.780> now<00:05:07.140> I

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
see how it goes just as it is now I

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.040 
see how it goes just as it is now I
probably<00:05:08.880> won't<00:05:09.060> be<00:05:09.240> cooking<00:05:09.600> anything<00:05:09.810> with

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
probably won't be cooking anything with

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.590 
probably won't be cooking anything with
too<00:05:10.230> much<00:05:10.410> fat<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.130> I'm<00:05:11.400> thinking<00:05:12.390> mainly

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
too much fat in it I'm thinking mainly

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.330 
too much fat in it I'm thinking mainly
like<00:05:12.870> hot<00:05:13.050> dogs<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.560> stuff<00:05:14.930> chicken<00:05:15.930> maybe

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.870

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
that's the BioLite grill so there it is

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.640 
that's the BioLite grill so there it is
just<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.419> quick<00:05:24.660> overview<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.350> stove

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650
