something really cool a new feature and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.799 
something really cool a new feature and
blender<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.940> don't<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.389> included

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
blender I don't know if it was included

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.210 
blender I don't know if it was included
into<00:00:17.300> blender<00:00:18.770> 2.63

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
into blender 2.63

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.349 
into blender 2.63
but<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.390> believe<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.250> definitely<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.990> 2.64

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
but I believe it is definitely in 2.64

sculpting mode this new feature which

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.830 
sculpting mode this new feature which
that<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:36.989> referring<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.520> masked

that I'm referring to is the masked
masking<00:00:39.840> feature<00:00:40.489> in<00:00:41.489> sculpt<00:00:42.180> mode<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
masking feature in sculpt mode this is a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.490 
masking feature in sculpt mode this is a
feature<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.300> persuaded<00:00:49.260> me

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
feature that that kind of persuaded me

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.850 
feature that that kind of persuaded me
to<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:50.070> ahead<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.730> switch<00:00:51.180> from<00:00:51.860> using

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to go ahead and switch from using

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.200 
to go ahead and switch from using
hexagon<00:00:54.559> 2.5<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.600> blender<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> let's<00:00:59.969> go

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
hexagon 2.5 over to blender so let's go

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
hexagon 2.5 over to blender so let's go
ahead<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:02.390> let<00:01:03.390> me<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.899> show<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.189> how<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
works and let's just take a look at it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.050 
works and let's just take a look at it
just<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:09.090> ahead<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.750> cube<00:01:10.170> wide

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
just go ahead and use this cube wide

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.800 
just go ahead and use this cube wide
multi-race<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.510> we'll<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.950> go<00:01:13.950> ahead<00:01:14.070> and

multi-race and we'll just go ahead and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
multi-race and we'll just go ahead and
apply<00:01:17.689> several<00:01:21.920> subdivisions<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
apply several subdivisions there and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
apply several subdivisions there and
let's<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.810> ahead<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.500> over<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> sculpt

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
let's go ahead and go on over to sculpt

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.090 
let's go ahead and go on over to sculpt
mode<00:01:29.150> yeah<00:01:30.259> let's<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:32.630> clay<00:01:33.630> brush

anyway I'm going to just how I've got
clay<00:02:26.890> brush<00:02:27.220> here<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.580> we'll<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:32.670> sculpt<00:02:33.670> on

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
clay brush here and we'll just sculpt on

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.120 
clay brush here and we'll just sculpt on
that<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.510> hopefully<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.800> see

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
that a little bit hopefully you can see

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.650 
that a little bit hopefully you can see
it<00:02:36.900> okay

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660

masking<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.900> access<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.320> hit<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
masking to access that you just hit the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.060 
masking to access that you just hit the
in<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:46.709> your<00:02:47.709> keyboard<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:50.440> course<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:50.890> have

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
in on your keyboard of course you have

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
in on your keyboard of course you have
your<00:02:51.100> typical<00:02:51.610> radius<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.660> strength

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
your typical radius and strength

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:01.580 
your typical radius and strength
settings<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> with<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:57.510> masking<00:02:58.920> turned<00:02:59.920> on

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
settings so with the masking turned on

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250 
settings so with the masking turned on
just<00:03:02.590> gonna<00:03:02.920> paint<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.400> mask<00:03:04.110> around<00:03:05.110> this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
just gonna paint a mask around this

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.350 
just gonna paint a mask around this
little<00:03:05.620> area<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.370> sculpted<00:03:09.150> also<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
little area I just sculpted also the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.440 
little area I just sculpted also the
higher<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:11.040> resolution<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:13.000> your<00:03:13.350> object

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
higher your resolution is on your object

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.610 
higher your resolution is on your object
the<00:03:16.450> finer<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.320> mask<00:03:17.620> will<00:03:17.920> be<00:03:19.410> let's<00:03:20.410> go

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the finer the mask will be let's go

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.500 
the finer the mask will be let's go
ahead<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.870> flatten<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.739> off<00:03:23.980> here

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
ahead and just flatten this off here

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.860 
ahead and just flatten this off here
what<00:03:25.510> masking<00:03:26.079> does<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.910> allows<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:27.940> to

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
what masking does is allows you to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.060 
what masking does is allows you to
sculpt<00:03:29.799> them<00:03:30.040> part<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.430> your<00:03:30.489> geometry<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
sculpt them part of your geometry and

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.380 
sculpt them part of your geometry and
wherever<00:03:33.070> your<00:03:33.250> mask<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.900> those

and<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:56.680> Burt<00:03:56.980> masks<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.750> let's<00:03:59.020> go<00:03:59.260> ahead<00:03:59.380> and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
and in Burt masks so let's go ahead and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.720 
and in Burt masks so let's go ahead and
control-z<00:04:00.460> that<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:02.220> invert<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:05.140> now<00:04:05.730> we

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
control-z that and invert it so now we

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.720 
control-z that and invert it so now we
can<00:04:06.940> go<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.270> here<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.900> kind<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:09.780> I

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
can go in here and just kind of I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.540 
can go in here and just kind of I
