far as you know what we need to do it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.969 
far as you know what we need to do it
get<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.420> done<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.720> as<00:01:38.990> far<00:01:39.200> as<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.440> know<00:01:39.530> being

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
ourselves but obviously you know being

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.380 
ourselves but obviously you know being
team<00:01:42.259> players<00:01:42.290> as<00:01:42.710> well<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:43.490> think<00:01:43.850> neither<00:01:44.210> we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
team players as well I think neither we

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.430 
team players as well I think neither we
got<00:01:44.509> out<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.840> real<00:01:44.990> should<00:01:45.229> be<00:01:45.290> no<00:01:45.380> reason

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
got out of the real should be no reason

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.890 
got out of the real should be no reason
that<00:01:45.710> anybody<00:01:46.160> should<00:01:46.430> have<00:01:46.640> any<00:01:46.840> reason<00:01:47.840> I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
that anybody should have any reason I

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.969 
that anybody should have any reason I
think<00:01:48.050> that's<00:01:48.170> going<00:01:48.320> down<00:01:48.440> played<00:01:48.770> again

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
think that's going down played again

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.499 
think that's going down played again
with<00:01:49.190> he<00:01:49.250> not<00:01:49.399> play<00:01:49.610> game<00:01:49.820> think<00:01:50.210> about<00:01:50.390> the

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
with he not play game think about the

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.850 
with he not play game think about the
winners<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.869> know<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.259> most<00:01:51.440> important

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
winners I know it the most important

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.600 
winners I know it the most important
thing<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.130> he<00:01:52.310> wants<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.580> win<00:01:53.380> he's<00:01:54.380> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
thing is that he wants to win he's a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.090 
thing is that he wants to win he's a
selfish<00:01:55.610> guy<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:57.050> know<00:01:57.170> about<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> team
