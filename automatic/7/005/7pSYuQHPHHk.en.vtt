frame<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.060> is<00:00:41.240> a<00:00:41.420> really<00:00:42.200> really<00:00:42.410> large<00:00:42.800> wave

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
frame this is a really really large wave

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.550 
frame this is a really really large wave
if<00:00:43.460> there's<00:00:43.670> 12<00:00:44.030> altogether<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.960> notably

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
if there's 12 altogether and notably

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.990 
if there's 12 altogether and notably
this<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.100> first<00:00:46.310> time<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.700> we<00:00:46.790> have<00:00:46.970> a

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
this is the first time that we have a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.240 
this is the first time that we have a
mixture<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.660> series<00:00:48.290> within<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.800> same<00:00:49.010> wave

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
mixture of series within the same wave

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.850 
mixture of series within the same wave
so<00:00:50.180> let's<00:00:50.750> just<00:00:50.930> go<00:00:51.050> left<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.410> right<00:00:51.620> starting

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
so let's just go left to right starting

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.580 
so let's just go left to right starting
with<00:00:52.280> Robin<00:00:53.150> one<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:53.750> rares<00:00:54.050> of<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:54.410> way

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
with Robin one of the rares of this way

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.580 
with Robin one of the rares of this way
if<00:00:54.650> it's<00:00:54.920> not<00:00:55.130> an<00:00:55.280> exclusive<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.590> it's

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
if it's not an exclusive but it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.170 
if it's not an exclusive but it's
definitely<00:00:58.070> hard<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.280> find<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.700> lot<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:58.970> stores

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
definitely hard to find a lot of stores

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.560 
definitely hard to find a lot of stores
got<00:00:59.390> less<00:00:59.660> than<00:00:59.870> 5<00:01:00.670> like<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.000> can<00:01:02.120> even<00:01:02.270> see

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
got less than 5 like you can even see

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.779 
got less than 5 like you can even see
close-ups<00:01:03.200> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.710> book<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.369> all<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
close-ups of the book and all the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.419 
close-ups of the book and all the
details<00:01:05.149> that<00:01:05.329> went<00:01:05.509> into<00:01:05.659> this<00:01:05.869> um<00:01:06.710> every

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
details that went into this um every

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.639 
details that went into this um every
single<00:01:07.729> amiibo<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.299> far<00:01:08.509> has<00:01:08.689> been<00:01:08.719> incredibly

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
single amiibo so far has been incredibly

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.599 
single amiibo so far has been incredibly
well<00:01:09.829> made<00:01:10.100> very<00:01:10.369> few<00:01:10.789> flaws<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.509> any<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.840> them

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
well made very few flaws in any of them

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.090 
well made very few flaws in any of them
Silver<00:01:14.390> Mario<00:01:14.719> which<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.259> not<00:01:15.710> an<00:01:15.829> exclusive

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
Silver Mario which is not an exclusive

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.010 
Silver Mario which is not an exclusive
like<00:01:16.490> gold<00:01:16.729> Mario<00:01:17.090> was<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.479> fact<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:17.869> rather

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
like gold Mario was in fact it's rather

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.260 
like gold Mario was in fact it's rather
common<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:18.829> very<00:01:19.520> glad<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:20.149> got

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
common but very glad that it got

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.029 
common but very glad that it got
released<00:01:20.600> very<00:01:20.869> glad<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.079> was<00:01:21.319> able<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.829> one

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
released very glad I was able to get one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.639 
released very glad I was able to get one
with<00:01:22.249> relatively<00:01:23.060> no<00:01:23.210> difficulties<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:24.499> the

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
with relatively no difficulties it's the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.459 
with relatively no difficulties it's the
same<00:01:24.829> as<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.189> Mario<00:01:25.999> Brothers<00:01:26.420> series<00:01:26.780> except

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
same as the Mario Brothers series except

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.669 
same as the Mario Brothers series except
you<00:01:27.560> know<00:01:27.679> just<00:01:27.950> plated<00:01:28.340> silver<00:01:29.560> put<00:01:30.560> you

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
you know just plated silver put you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.029 
you know just plated silver put you
right<00:01:30.710> back<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:31.369> there<00:01:31.609> we<00:01:32.479> got<00:01:32.630> Wario<00:01:33.139> who's

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
right back in there we got Wario who's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.679 
right back in there we got Wario who's
seen<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.249> fell<00:01:34.460> over<00:01:35.319> so<00:01:36.319> we<00:01:36.469> have<00:01:36.619> Wario<00:01:37.689> which

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
seen it fell over so we have Wario which

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.359 
seen it fell over so we have Wario which
is<00:01:38.960> probably<00:01:39.289> my<00:01:39.439> least<00:01:39.649> favorite<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.189> this

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
is probably my least favorite of this

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.739 
is probably my least favorite of this
wave<00:01:40.549> honestly<00:01:40.999> I'm<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.270> not<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> fan<00:01:41.719> of

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
wave honestly I'm just not a fan of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.349 
wave honestly I'm just not a fan of
Wario<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.859> design<00:01:43.189> is<00:01:43.219> incredibly<00:01:43.609> good

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
Wario but the design is incredibly good

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.330 
Wario but the design is incredibly good
I<00:01:44.389> mean<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.749> can<00:01:44.869> see<00:01:45.049> look<00:01:45.889> at<00:01:46.009> all<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I mean you can see look at all the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.879 
I mean you can see look at all the
details<00:01:46.759> on<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.060> back<00:01:47.209> fissure<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.659> stuff<00:01:48.170> or

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
details on the back fissure and stuff or

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.559 
details on the back fissure and stuff or
exactly<00:01:49.340> or<00:01:49.490> whatever<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:49.880> want<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.090> call<00:01:50.240> it

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
exactly or whatever you want to call it
