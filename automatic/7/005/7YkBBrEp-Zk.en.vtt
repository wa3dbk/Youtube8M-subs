00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
into what we now know and love on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.550 
into what we now know and love on
Strictly<00:02:29.239> as<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.780> normal<00:02:30.019> watts<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
Strictly as just the normal watts as a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
Strictly as just the normal watts as a
normal<00:02:30.950> voice<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.489> main<00:02:31.730> difference<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
normal voice so the main difference is
