00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
chair I apologize trying to fix my

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
chair I apologize trying to fix my
camera<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:09.179> best<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.570> can<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.840> can't

camera as best I can I can't
anyways<00:00:11.000> this<00:00:12.000> one's<00:00:12.179> coming<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.570> Intel<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
anyways this one's coming from Intel and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
anyways this one's coming from Intel and
NASA<00:00:15.120> actually<00:00:15.690> put<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.020> up<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
NASA actually put this up that there's a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.029 
NASA actually put this up that there's a
1.2<00:00:17.910> mile<00:00:18.359> wide<00:00:18.539> asteroid<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.529> would

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
1.2 mile wide asteroid that would

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
1.2 mile wide asteroid that would
probably<00:00:20.279> strike<00:00:20.760> earth<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.240> 2019<00:00:23.210> but<00:00:28.760> change

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
probably strike earth in 2019 but change

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.709 
probably strike earth in 2019 but change
its<00:00:30.029> story<00:00:30.420> four<00:00:30.869> days<00:00:31.080> later<00:00:31.619> pipe<00:00:35.719> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
its story four days later pipe the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.069 
its story four days later pipe the
asteroid<00:00:37.280> named<00:00:38.280> her<00:00:38.579> number<00:00:38.969> eight<00:00:39.480> nine

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
asteroid named her number eight nine

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
asteroid named her number eight nine
nine<00:00:40.110> five<00:00:40.649> nine<00:00:41.960> 2002<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.340> t7<00:00:44.809> was<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> fact

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
nine five nine 2002 and t7 was in fact

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.510 
nine five nine 2002 and t7 was in fact
assigned<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> positive<00:00:47.340> impact<00:00:47.670> rating<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
assigned a positive impact rating on the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
assigned a positive impact rating on the
Camaro<00:00:50.520> technically<00:00:51.239> impact<00:00:51.600> hazard<00:00:52.020> scale

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
Camaro technically impact hazard scale

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
Camaro technically impact hazard scale
meaning<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.219> object<00:00:53.670> will<00:00:54.210> likely<00:00:54.600> strike

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
meaning the object will likely strike

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.389 
meaning the object will likely strike
earth<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.190> future<00:00:56.550> date<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.920> has<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> look

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
earth on some future date it has a look

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
earth on some future date it has a look
but<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.000> said<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> low<00:01:01.109> probability

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but they said it had a low probability

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
but they said it had a low probability
in<00:01:01.980> 2002<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> impact<00:01:05.189> increase<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.030> 2019

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in 2002 but the impact increase in 2019

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.030 
in 2002 but the impact increase in 2019
so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:08.119> haven't<00:01:09.119> put<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> there<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.229> behalf

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so I haven't put this up there on behalf

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
so I haven't put this up there on behalf
of<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:15.170> September<00:01:16.250> 16<00:01:17.250> talks<00:01:18.080> there

these September 2016 talks of the
asteroid<00:01:22.650> impact<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.729> September<00:01:24.360> 2015

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
asteroid impact we're in September 2015

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.569 
asteroid impact we're in September 2015
talks<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> they're

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

the earth BBC reported researchers

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.860 
the earth BBC reported researchers
estimated<00:02:22.239> February<00:02:22.780> 1<00:02:22.959> 2019<00:02:24.630> being<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
approximate time you know or date it'll

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.850 
approximate time you know or date it'll
hit<00:02:29.590> with<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> twenty<00:02:31.150> eight<00:02:31.590> kilometer<00:02:32.590> a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
hit with a twenty eight kilometer a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
hit with a twenty eight kilometer a
second<00:02:34.440> speed<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:39.599> everybody<00:02:40.599> is<00:02:40.690> hearing

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
second speed so everybody is hearing

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.350 
second speed so everybody is hearing
about<00:02:41.370> Nibiru<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.730> everybody's<00:02:43.120> hearing

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
about Nibiru and everybody's hearing

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.210 
about Nibiru and everybody's hearing
place<00:02:43.750> everybody<00:02:44.140> about<00:02:44.680> that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
place everybody about that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.539 
place everybody about that
and<00:02:46.799> NASA<00:02:47.799> basically<00:02:49.769> did<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:50.980> twice<00:02:51.280> I

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and NASA basically did this twice I

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.180 
and NASA basically did this twice I
remember<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:53.079> is<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.680> two<00:02:53.950> stories

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
remember this is one of like two stories

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.370 
remember this is one of like two stories
they<00:02:54.459> put<00:02:54.670> out<00:02:54.819> one<00:02:55.060> was<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.630> September<00:02:56.230> s

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
they put out one was on September s

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.530 
they put out one was on September s
fitting<00:02:56.829> that<00:02:56.920> got<00:02:57.340> shot<00:02:57.640> at<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.120> distance

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
fitting that got shot at the distance

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.650 
fitting that got shot at the distance
because<00:02:58.840> nobody<00:02:59.200> wants<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> talk<00:02:59.829> about<00:02:59.890> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
because nobody wants to talk about that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.030 
because nobody wants to talk about that
second<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.750> goes<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.560> then<00:03:02.860> they

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
second it goes this and then they

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.490 
second it goes this and then they
