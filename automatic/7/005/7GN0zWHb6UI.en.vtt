come down and you can see it comes down
now<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> back<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:26.970> you'll<00:00:27.840> see

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
now so back up a little bit you'll see

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
now so back up a little bit you'll see
where<00:00:28.199> I'm<00:00:28.230> standing<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> where

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
where I'm standing here this is where

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.339 
where I'm standing here this is where
the<00:00:30.119> river<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.660> came<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> was

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the river would have came if it was

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.139 
the river would have came if it was
going<00:00:31.650> straight<00:00:31.769> still<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> big<00:00:32.850> tree

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
going straight still about that big tree

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.020 
going straight still about that big tree
fell<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.920> bunch<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.190> stuff<00:00:35.489> fell<00:00:35.910> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
fell down and a bunch more stuff fell in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.690 
fell down and a bunch more stuff fell in
front<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.920> causing<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> river<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
front of it causing the river to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.709 
front of it causing the river to
redirect<00:00:39.649> over<00:00:40.649> through<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.510> come

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
redirect over through here and if I come

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
redirect over through here and if I come
up<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.260> bank<00:00:43.559> you'll<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.940> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
up here on this bank you'll see it just

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
up here on this bank you'll see it just
pulls<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.899> into<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> bank<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> shoots

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
pulls down into this bank and shoots

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
pulls down into this bank and shoots
right<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> underneath<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.329> Bank<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
right out underneath of this Bank and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.729 
right out underneath of this Bank and
comes<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> river<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:51.739> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
comes back into the river down there so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
comes back into the river down there so
where<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> used<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> river<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
where this used to be the river and it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
where this used to be the river and it
was<00:00:54.660> blocked<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> where<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:55.949> going

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
was blocked off this is where I'm going

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
was blocked off this is where I'm going
to<00:00:56.190> work<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.899> because<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.289> would

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to work here because this here would

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
to work here because this here would
have<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:58.710> directly<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> middle<00:00:59.910> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
have been directly into the middle of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.990 
have been directly into the middle of
the<00:01:00.180> river<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.690> few<00:01:01.440> years<00:01:01.890> ago<00:01:02.129> i'm<00:01:02.520> guessing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the river a few years ago i'm guessing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
the river a few years ago i'm guessing
or<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> how<00:01:03.719> long<00:01:03.899> ago<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> spin<00:01:04.680> down

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
or on the how long ago this spin down

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.230 
or on the how long ago this spin down
but<00:01:05.309> i<00:01:06.080> tried<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.189> few<00:01:08.189> pans<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.790> yesterday

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
but i tried a few pans here yesterday
