00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
slightly older ones in it all the the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.240 
slightly older ones in it all the the
vine<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.250> stuff<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.869> climbers<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.250> with

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
vine kind of stuff the climbers so with

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.700 
vine kind of stuff the climbers so with
this<00:00:20.400> bed<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.510> ends<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this bed you can see that ends and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.900 
this bed you can see that ends and
they're<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:22.980> too<00:00:23.130> close<00:00:23.369> together

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
they're not too close together

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.320 
they're not too close together
reasonably<00:00:24.869> sparse<00:00:25.230> probably<00:00:25.880> eight<00:00:26.880> inches

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
reasonably sparse probably eight inches

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.500 
reasonably sparse probably eight inches
15<00:00:28.080> centimeters<00:00:28.619> between<00:00:28.769> each<00:00:29.070> plant<00:00:29.510> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
15 centimeters between each plant so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.920 
15 centimeters between each plant so
gives<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.019> room<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> grow<00:00:32.780> now<00:00:33.780> as

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
gives them a lot of room to grow now as

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.770 
gives them a lot of room to grow now as
they<00:00:34.170> pick<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.510> sides

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
they pick up and you can see these sides

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
they pick up and you can see these sides
got<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> lot<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.430> holes<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
got a lot more lot more holes in that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330 
got a lot more lot more holes in that
side<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.500> generally<00:00:40.500> these<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.920> seedlings

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
side so generally these little seedlings

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.950 
side so generally these little seedlings
normally<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> side<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> moment

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
normally on this side at the moment

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
normally on this side at the moment
they're<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> work<00:00:44.250> was

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
they're not because a bit of work was

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.560 
they're not because a bit of work was
being<00:00:44.610> done<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.969> pumps<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> things

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
being done on pumps and things

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.709 
being done on pumps and things
underneath<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> bed<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> beds<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> sump<00:00:48.420> on

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
underneath the bed this beds a sump on

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
underneath the bed this beds a sump on
the<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.559> side<00:00:49.829> over<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the other side over there and kind of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.250 
the other side over there and kind of
see<00:00:51.059> through<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.629> window<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.170> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
see through that little window there in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
see through that little window there in
the<00:00:52.320> other<00:00:52.440> greenhouse<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.940> gravel<00:00:54.270> bed

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the other greenhouse that's a gravel bed

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.380 
the other greenhouse that's a gravel bed
in<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.640> acts<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> sump

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
in there and this side acts like a sump

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
in there and this side acts like a sump
it's<00:00:57.600> called<00:00:58.199> an<00:00:58.320> anchor<00:00:58.500> draught<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it's called an anchor draught so it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.959 
it's called an anchor draught so it's
basically<00:01:00.600> same<00:01:01.350> concept<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> raft<00:01:02.550> except

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
basically same concept as a raft except

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
basically same concept as a raft except
it's<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.300> moving<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it's not moving it's not going up and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.310 
it's not moving it's not going up and
down<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:04.979> made<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> styrofoam<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
down it's not made of styrofoam so it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.910 
down it's not made of styrofoam so it's
it's<00:01:07.760> same<00:01:09.200> level<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's same level all the time and the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's same level all the time and the
water<00:01:11.130> level<00:01:11.430> comes<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
water level comes up and down so as that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
water level comes up and down so as that
grow<00:01:14.010> bed<00:01:14.250> fills<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.119> water<00:01:15.270> level<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
grow bed fills the water level in this

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.039 
grow bed fills the water level in this
bed<00:01:16.409> goes<00:01:16.650> down<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.299> that<00:01:18.299> grow<00:01:18.509> bed<00:01:18.689> empties

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
bed goes down as that grow bed empties

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
bed goes down as that grow bed empties
into<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.680> sump<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> wall<00:01:20.729> ever<00:01:20.939> comes<00:01:21.180> back

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
into the sump the wall ever comes back

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
into the sump the wall ever comes back
so<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.470> level<00:01:22.530> come<00:01:22.920> back<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> sit

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so the water level come back and sit

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
so the water level come back and sit
just<00:01:23.790> underneath<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> roots<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> water

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
just underneath the roots see the water

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
just underneath the roots see the water
in<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> other<00:01:26.729> sea<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
in there for the other sea about at the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
in there for the other sea about at the
moment<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> low<00:01:29.040> level<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
moment that's on the low level then the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
moment that's on the low level then the
water<00:01:29.970> comes<00:01:30.689> back<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.500> about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
water comes back up it will come about

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.899 
water comes back up it will come about
an<00:01:31.860> inch<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.340> underneath<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.380> net<00:01:34.560> pots

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
an inch from underneath so the net pots

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
an inch from underneath so the net pots
see<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.030> upside<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.479> there<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.409> net<00:01:37.560> pots

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
see one upside down there the net pots

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.819 
see one upside down there the net pots
offset<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:38.670> inch<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.380> until<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
offset about an inch in water until the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.240 
offset about an inch in water until the

bed fills up empties into this one which
aerates<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.700> well

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
aerates it as well

that comes out of that bed comes into

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.950 
that comes out of that bed comes into
the<00:01:54.899> decent<00:01:55.290> break<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.390> gives<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the decent break and gives it a lot of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990

underneath<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.860> bed<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:06.079> with<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.259> bed<00:02:07.970> why

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
underneath this bed so with this bed why

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.620 
underneath this bed so with this bed why
there's<00:02:09.330> basically<00:02:10.050> every<00:02:10.319> second<00:02:10.709> net<00:02:11.670> pot

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
there's basically every second net pot

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.440 
there's basically every second net pot
is<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.860> plants<00:02:14.190> grow<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:15.210> plant

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is that as the plants grow I can plant

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
is that as the plants grow I can plant
it<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.660> heavily<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.170> seedlings<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:17.520> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it up heavily with seedlings right so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.780 
it up heavily with seedlings right so
that<00:02:18.660> whole<00:02:18.900> area<00:02:19.430> seedlings<00:02:20.430> whatever

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
going in there they can go in very tight

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.350 
going in there they can go in very tight
very<00:02:25.950> very<00:02:26.430> tightly<00:02:26.700> next<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> each<00:02:27.150> other

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
very very tightly next to each other

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240 
very very tightly next to each other
because<00:02:27.990> as<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.710> see<00:02:28.770> from<00:02:29.070> little

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
because as you can see from little

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.470 
because as you can see from little
ceilings<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.730> there<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.180> take<00:02:30.330> up

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ceilings down there they don't take up

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.300 
ceilings down there they don't take up
much<00:02:30.600> room<00:02:30.660> they're<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.220> encroaching<00:02:32.220> on

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
much room they're not encroaching on

each other for a while

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.830 
each other for a while
and<00:02:33.560> as<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.770> plants<00:02:35.070> grow<00:02:35.100> up<00:02:35.540> I'm<00:02:36.540> able<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and as the plants grow up I'm able to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680 
and as the plants grow up I'm able to
replant<00:02:37.410> them<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.770> into<00:02:38.520> say<00:02:39.060> gravel<00:02:39.510> grow

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690

beds<00:02:40.160> I've<00:02:41.160> got<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> fair<00:02:41.610> few<00:02:41.790> systems<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.510> so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
beds I've got a fair few systems here so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.920 
beds I've got a fair few systems here so
they<00:02:43.650> could<00:02:43.710> go<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.340> system<00:02:44.820> or<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
they could go in that system or if you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.360 
they could go in that system or if you
can<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.470> right<00:02:46.650> over<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.950> top<00:02:47.160> there's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
can see one right over the top there's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.800 
can see one right over the top there's
another<00:02:47.640> system<00:02:48.120> over<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> other<00:02:48.540> side

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
another system over the other side

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.170 
another system over the other side
they're<00:02:49.020> neither<00:02:49.230> bungalow<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.940> so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
they're neither bungalow and there so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.840 
they're neither bungalow and there so

lettuce here on a lettuce here I can
replant<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:44.970> lettuce<00:03:45.209> elsewhere<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.840> one

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
replant this lettuce elsewhere and one

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.800 
replant this lettuce elsewhere and one
of<00:03:46.050> my<00:03:46.140> other<00:03:46.230> systems<00:03:46.970> or<00:03:47.970> even<00:03:48.030> harvest<00:03:48.690> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
of my other systems or even harvest it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.530 
of my other systems or even harvest it
if<00:03:49.110> they're<00:03:49.290> getting<00:03:49.440> big<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:50.330> said<00:03:51.330> that'll

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
if they're getting big and said that'll

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.260 
if they're getting big and said that'll
fill<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> hole<00:03:52.280> making<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.520> bed<00:03:53.790> about<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
fill the hole making this bed about the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.090 
fill the hole making this bed about the
same<00:03:54.420> capacity<00:03:54.600> as<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.140> big<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.770> as<00:03:55.890> full

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
same capacity as that big not as full

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.510 
same capacity as that big not as full
but<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:57.450> start<00:03:57.660> out<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.410> know<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.740> seems<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
but to start out you know this seems to

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.430 
but to start out you know this seems to
work<00:03:59.550> well<00:03:59.850> planning<00:04:00.570> really<00:04:00.930> close<00:04:01.260> together

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
work well planning really close together

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.810 
work well planning really close together
and<00:04:02.450> having<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.660> option<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.580> pull<00:04:05.580> in<00:04:05.730> or

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
and having that option to pull in or

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.120 
and having that option to pull in or
pull<00:04:06.030> out<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.990> all<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> second<00:04:07.770> plants

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
pull out all the all the second plants

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.370 
pull out all the all the second plants
or<00:04:08.280> third<00:04:08.490> plants<00:04:08.940> or<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.450> basically<00:04:10.080> just<00:04:10.230> do

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
or third plants or you basically just do

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.230 
or third plants or you basically just do
it<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:11.010> as<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.520> grow<00:04:11.730> depending<00:04:12.150> on

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
it as they as they grow depending on

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.140 
it as they as they grow depending on
what's<00:04:12.930> growing<00:04:13.170> faster<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:13.980> whatnot<00:04:14.970> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
what's growing faster and whatnot and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.630 
what's growing faster and whatnot and
obviously<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.080> net<00:04:16.290> pot<00:04:16.530> system<00:04:17.160> like<00:04:17.489> this

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
obviously the net pot system like this

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.190 
obviously the net pot system like this
anchor<00:04:17.910> draft<00:04:18.150> gives<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.630> flexibility

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
anchor draft gives you that flexibility

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.409 
anchor draft gives you that flexibility
to<00:04:19.530> move<00:04:20.190> them<00:04:20.459> quite<00:04:20.700> easily<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.210> move

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
to move them quite easily I can move

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.690 
to move them quite easily I can move
this<00:04:21.630> plant<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.260> somewhere<00:04:22.740> else<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:23.340> know<00:04:23.370> if

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
this plant to somewhere else you know if

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.330 
this plant to somewhere else you know if
it<00:04:23.820> needs<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> better<00:04:24.180> position<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> needs

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
it needs a better position if it needs

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.700 
it needs a better position if it needs
son<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.690> other<00:04:26.810> end<00:04:27.050> down<00:04:27.169> there<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.590> the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
son the other end down there is the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.730 
son the other end down there is the
sunny<00:04:27.919> set<00:04:28.190> aside<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:29.410> aspect<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.650> this

sunny set aside of this aspect of this

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.440 
sunny set aside of this aspect of this
greenhouse<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:31.400> there's<00:04:31.580> chilli<00:04:31.850> plants<00:04:32.270> and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
greenhouse so there's chilli plants and

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.970 
greenhouse so there's chilli plants and
you<00:04:32.750> know<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.050> point<00:04:33.260> like<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.680> heat<00:04:33.830> down

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
you know the point like the heat down

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.159 
you know the point like the heat down
that<00:04:34.190> in<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.520> more<00:04:35.180> let<00:04:35.450> us<00:04:35.570> sum<00:04:35.750> things<00:04:35.960> up

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
that in and more let us sum things up

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.010 
that in and more let us sum things up
that'll<00:04:36.440> be<00:04:36.530> up<00:04:36.650> there<00:04:36.770> soon<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.930> know

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
that'll be up there soon so and you know

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.360 
that'll be up there soon so and you know
most<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.290> plants<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.860> other<00:04:39.980> grow<00:04:40.220> bed

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
most the plants in that other grow bed

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.700 
most the plants in that other grow bed
there<00:04:40.550> are<00:04:40.639> being<00:04:40.820> planted<00:04:41.090> from<00:04:41.389> here<00:04:41.710> and

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
there are being planted from here and

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.230 
there are being planted from here and
then<00:04:42.860> moved<00:04:43.070> across<00:04:43.340> before<00:04:43.700> they<00:04:43.940> get<00:04:44.090> too

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
then moved across before they get too

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.980 
then moved across before they get too
big<00:04:44.270> or<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.740> as<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.220> net<00:04:46.400> pot<00:04:46.610> as<00:04:47.480> they<00:04:47.720> start

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
big or so as the net pot as they start

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.080 
big or so as the net pot as they start
growing<00:04:48.169> once<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.889> roots<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.550> start<00:04:49.820> coming

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
growing once the roots just start coming

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.230 
growing once the roots just start coming
through<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.330> pot<00:04:50.889> I'll<00:04:51.889> generally<00:04:52.370> get<00:04:53.090> all

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
through the pot I'll generally get all

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.320 
through the pot I'll generally get all
the<00:04:53.360> excess<00:04:53.690> out<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.080> this<00:04:54.340> bed<00:04:55.340> and<00:04:55.490> put<00:04:56.240> them

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
the excess out of this bed and put them

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.420 
the excess out of this bed and put them
replant<00:04:57.200> them<00:04:57.320> into<00:04:57.530> other<00:04:57.680> beds<00:04:57.979> you<00:04:58.370> know

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
replant them into other beds you know

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.270 
replant them into other beds you know
and<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:59.270> gravel<00:04:59.570> beds<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.860> bed<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.130> there

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
and the gravel beds is the bed in there

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.100 
and the gravel beds is the bed in there
is<00:05:01.400> quite<00:05:01.610> large<00:05:01.880> which<00:05:02.419> as<00:05:02.600> large<00:05:02.840> as<00:05:02.990> this

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
is quite large which as large as this

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.350 
is quite large which as large as this
for<00:05:03.320> area<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.919> see<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.880> goes<00:05:05.060> right<00:05:05.090> down

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
for area and see it goes right down

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.409 
for area and see it goes right down
there<00:05:05.780> kind<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.200> thing<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:07.060> that's<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.240> main

there kind of thing and that's the main
you<00:05:09.080> know<00:05:09.110> filter<00:05:09.590> for<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:09.860> system<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.710> just

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
you know filter for this system so just

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.500 
you know filter for this system so just
show<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.010> something<00:05:13.490> up<00:05:13.850> here<00:05:14.120> we<00:05:14.419> have

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
show you something up here we have

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.430 
show you something up here we have
another<00:05:15.370> mother<00:05:16.370> seed<00:05:16.639> bed<00:05:17.240> here<00:05:17.600> so<00:05:18.200> these

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
another mother seed bed here so these

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.860 
another mother seed bed here so these
are<00:05:18.500> all<00:05:18.820> again<00:05:19.820> seedlings<00:05:20.330> getting<00:05:20.600> planted

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
are all again seedlings getting planted

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.690 
are all again seedlings getting planted
again<00:05:21.200> today<00:05:21.500> they'll<00:05:21.740> be<00:05:21.830> all<00:05:22.160> planted<00:05:22.580> II

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
again today they'll be all planted II

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.180 
again today they'll be all planted II
will<00:05:23.600> numbered<00:05:23.960> off<00:05:24.050> with<00:05:24.229> their<00:05:24.440> sticks<00:05:24.950> and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
will numbered off with their sticks and

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.820 
will numbered off with their sticks and
whatever<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:27.139> just<00:05:27.320> gives<00:05:27.470> me<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.680> extra

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
whatever so it just gives me that extra

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.880 
whatever so it just gives me that extra

so yeah just an update on why and how
and<00:05:48.919> when<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.280> plant<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> seedlings<00:05:50.030> what<00:05:50.450> we

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
and when we plant the seedlings what we

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.930 
and when we plant the seedlings what we
do<00:05:50.720> with<00:05:51.710> rotation<00:05:52.310> with<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.490> different<00:05:52.789> grow

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
do with rotation with the different grow

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.640 
do with rotation with the different grow
beds<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:54.729> and<00:05:55.729> how<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:55.940> add-on<00:05:56.410> grow<00:05:57.410> beds

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
beds and and how the add-on grow beds

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.480 
beds and and how the add-on grow beds
are<00:05:57.830> quite<00:05:58.070> easily

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
are quite easily

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.340 
are quite easily
you<00:05:58.760> know<00:05:58.880> tapped<00:05:59.150> into<00:05:59.330> a<00:05:59.419> system<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.960> simple

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
you know tapped into a system a simple

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.710 
you know tapped into a system a simple
point<00:06:00.500> which<00:06:01.400> some<00:06:01.669> I<00:06:01.910> might<00:06:02.210> show<00:06:02.389> in<00:06:02.510> another

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
point which some I might show in another

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.379 
point which some I might show in another
video<00:06:02.960> now<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:03.889> do<00:06:04.280> that<00:06:04.460> without<00:06:04.610> having<00:06:05.120> any

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
video now to do that without having any

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.530 
video now to do that without having any
other<00:06:05.539> pipes<00:06:05.840> connected<00:06:06.289> to<00:06:06.410> it
