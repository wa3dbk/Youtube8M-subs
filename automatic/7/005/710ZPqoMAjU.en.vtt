00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
hi this is Tim Stein and in this video I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.650 
hi this is Tim Stein and in this video I
want<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> talk<00:00:10.230> about<00:00:10.349> oral<00:00:10.740> training<00:00:11.570> what<00:00:12.570> do

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
want to talk about oral training what do

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.209 
want to talk about oral training what do
I<00:00:12.719> mean<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:12.929> oral<00:00:13.290> training<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> mean<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
I mean by oral training what I mean is

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.390 
I mean by oral training what I mean is
the<00:00:14.309> development<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> ear<00:00:15.800> when<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.830> play

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the development of the ear when you play

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.220 
the development of the ear when you play
music<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:18.090> very<00:00:18.330> important<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> listen<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
music it's very important to listen to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.660 
music it's very important to listen to
exactly<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.070> you're<00:00:20.279> doing

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
exactly what it is you're doing

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
exactly what it is you're doing
if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> can't<00:00:21.480> listen<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.199> doing

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
if you can't listen to what you're doing

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
if you can't listen to what you're doing
then<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.580> difficult<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.090> play<00:00:24.269> well

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
then it's very difficult to play well

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.910 
then it's very difficult to play well
and<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> talk<00:00:25.410> about<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.830> know

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and you want to talk about you know

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.830 
and you want to talk about you know
adjustments<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.699> tone<00:00:27.210> levels<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.660> want<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
adjustments of tone levels you want to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
adjustments of tone levels you want to
play<00:00:27.960> loud<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.439> want<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> play<00:00:28.769> soft<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.369> want

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
play loud you want to play soft you want

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
play loud you want to play soft you want
to<00:00:29.640> hear<00:00:29.820> what's<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.689> when<00:00:31.109> you're

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to hear what's going on when you're

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.770 
to hear what's going on when you're
playing<00:00:31.650> many<00:00:32.399> notes<00:00:32.640> within<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.059> cordon<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
playing many notes within a cordon you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
playing many notes within a cordon you
want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> listen<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> what's<00:00:34.620> happening<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
want to listen to what's happening in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.560 
want to listen to what's happening in
the<00:00:35.219> left<00:00:35.399> hand<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:35.850> important<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the left hand it's very important to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 
the left hand it's very important to
have<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.930> good<00:00:37.290> an<00:00:37.440> ear<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.860> possible<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
have as good an ear as possible how can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.139 
have as good an ear as possible how can
we<00:00:39.270> develop<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> ear<00:00:40.399> well<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:42.030> always

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
we develop the ear well I would always

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
we develop the ear well I would always
start<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:42.989> very<00:00:43.170> simple<00:00:43.320> warm-up

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
start with some very simple warm-up

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.900 
start with some very simple warm-up
exercises<00:00:45.469> take<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.739> example<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.520> playing

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
exercises take for example just playing

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
exercises take for example just playing
single<00:00:48.660> notes<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.500> singing<00:00:50.039> them

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
single notes and then just singing them

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
single notes and then just singing them
back<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> call<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.270> warming<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> ear

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
back what I call just warming up the ear

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
back what I call just warming up the ear
even<00:00:52.440> before<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.039> start<00:00:53.399> playing<00:00:53.699> anything

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
even before you start playing anything

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.459 
even before you start playing anything
so<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.809> play<00:00:55.230> any<00:00:55.500> single<00:00:55.980> note<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.469> just

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
so just play any single note and just

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.610 
so just play any single note and just
sing<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.739> back<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.340> LA<00:01:00.289> another<00:01:01.289> note<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
sing it back to LA another note in

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170 
sing it back to LA another note in
trying<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> sing<00:01:02.129> notes<00:01:02.280> within<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.910> range

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
trying to sing notes within your range

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
trying to sing notes within your range
if<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> sing<00:01:03.719> notes<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.320> without<00:01:05.010> your

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
if you sing notes that without your

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.350 
if you sing notes that without your
range<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.700> quite<00:01:05.880> difficult<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
range it's actually quite difficult to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
range it's actually quite difficult to
pitch<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.710> worried

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pitch them and then we're not worried

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.539 
pitch them and then we're not worried
about<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.710> quality<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> pitch<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.340> more

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
about the quality of pitch we're more

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
about the quality of pitch we're more
worried<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.420> being<00:01:12.810> concerned<00:01:13.290> about

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
worried about just being concerned about

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.570 
worried about just being concerned about
being<00:01:13.590> able<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.830> hear<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.400> you're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
being able to hear what it is you're

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.580 
being able to hear what it is you're
actually<00:01:14.700> playing<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.960> say<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
actually playing so as I say just play a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.990 
actually playing so as I say just play a
few<00:01:16.680> notes<00:01:18.049> LA<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.710> sing<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
few notes LA and just sing them back and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
few notes LA and just sing them back and
once<00:01:21.180> you've<00:01:21.420> played<00:01:21.810> single<00:01:22.650> notes<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.520> can

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
once you've played single notes you can

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
once you've played single notes you can
then<00:01:23.939> start<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.659> play<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:24.990> notes<00:01:25.259> at<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.799> time

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
then start to play two notes at a time

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.210 
then start to play two notes at a time
and<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.240> try<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.990> sing<00:01:28.350> either<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> top

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and you can try to sing either the top

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
and you can try to sing either the top
note<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.729> bottom<00:01:30.329> note<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.750> let's<00:01:30.990> take

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
note or the bottom note so let's take

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679 
note or the bottom note so let's take
some<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.710> simple<00:01:32.070> intervals<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:33.270> example

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
some very simple intervals for example

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
some very simple intervals for example
and<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> talk<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.680> intervals<00:01:35.369> I'm

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and when I talk about intervals I'm

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
and when I talk about intervals I'm
talking<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> distance<00:01:36.750> from<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.170> note

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
talking about the distance from one note

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
talking about the distance from one note
to<00:01:37.409> another<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.579> an<00:01:38.700> interval<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.240> third<00:01:39.570> for

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to another so an interval of a third for

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.069 
to another so an interval of a third for
example<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.530> C<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.670> e<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.329> interval

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
example would be C to an e an interval

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
example would be C to an e an interval
of<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> fifth<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.250> C<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> G<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> on

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of a fifth would be a C to a G and so on

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.749 
of a fifth would be a C to a G and so on
so<00:01:48.030> let's<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.840> interval<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.799> fifth<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so let's take an interval of a fifth a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
so let's take an interval of a fifth a
seeing<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> G<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.869> example<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> play

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
seeing the G for example so you play

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.179 
seeing the G for example so you play
them<00:01:52.979> both<00:01:53.130> together<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.259> then<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.439> sing<00:01:55.950> out

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
them both together and then you sing out

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
them both together and then you sing out
whichever<00:01:56.670> sound<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.020> hear<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
whichever sound you hear so if it's the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.590 
whichever sound you hear so if it's the
G<00:01:59.460> LA<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.329> first

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
G LA and if it's the see you here first

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
G LA and if it's the see you here first
of<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> sing<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> C

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
of all you sing the C

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.109 
of all you sing the C
if<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.869> can't<00:02:07.229> hear<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> top<00:02:08.250> note<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if you can't hear the top note and you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.100 
if you can't hear the top note and you
only<00:02:09.270> hear<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> bottom<00:02:09.840> note<00:02:09.989> that's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
only hear the bottom note that's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.610 
only hear the bottom note that's
absolutely<00:02:10.619> fine<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.360> sing<00:02:12.900> or<00:02:13.110> rather<00:02:13.470> if

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
absolutely fine if you sing or rather if

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.309 
absolutely fine if you sing or rather if
you<00:02:13.650> play<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.250> top<00:02:14.489> note<00:02:14.730> first<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.750> then

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
you play the top note first and then

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.559 
you play the top note first and then
sing<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> back<00:02:17.069> it's<00:02:17.340> much<00:02:17.610> easier<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
sing it back it's much easier if you

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.600 
sing it back it's much easier if you
play<00:02:18.900> both<00:02:19.290> notes<00:02:19.319> together<00:02:20.099> at<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> same

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
play both notes together at the same

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.220 
play both notes together at the same
time<00:02:20.880> sometimes<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.510> quite<00:02:21.630> difficult<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
time sometimes it's quite difficult to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.009 
time sometimes it's quite difficult to
hear<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.890> top<00:02:23.130> note<00:02:23.340> or<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.910> bottom<00:02:24.239> note<00:02:24.420> so

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
hear the top note or the bottom note so

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.559 
hear the top note or the bottom note so
for<00:02:25.200> example<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.709> play<00:02:25.920> them<00:02:26.099> again<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:27.330> it's

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
for example you play them again if it's

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.350 
for example you play them again if it's
the<00:02:27.780> top<00:02:28.019> note<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.470> hear<00:02:29.060> seeing<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> top

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the top note you hear seeing the top

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.940 
the top note you hear seeing the top
note<00:02:30.599> if<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> bottom<00:02:31.440> note<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.739> hear

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
note if it's the bottom note you hear

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710 
note if it's the bottom note you hear
seeing<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> bottom<00:02:32.760> note<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.180> again<00:02:33.599> if

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
seeing the bottom note and again if

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.820 
seeing the bottom note and again if
you're<00:02:33.840> playing<00:02:34.140> them<00:02:34.290> together<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.739> you're

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
you're playing them together and you're

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.710 
you're playing them together and you're
finding<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.280> difficult<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:36.150> repeat<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
finding that difficult just repeat the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.009 
finding that difficult just repeat the
notes<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.230> their<00:02:37.560> own<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:39.480> sing<00:02:39.840> them

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
notes on their own and then sing them

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.580 
notes on their own and then sing them
out<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.489> also<00:02:41.790> take<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.209> very<00:02:42.569> simple<00:02:42.959> tune

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
out you can also take a very simple tune

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860 
out you can also take a very simple tune
like<00:02:43.920> twinkle<00:02:44.610> twinkle<00:02:44.849> little<00:02:45.090> star<00:02:45.599> for

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
like twinkle twinkle little star for

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.720 
like twinkle twinkle little star for
example<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.590> even<00:02:46.799> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.010> don't<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.549> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
example and even if you don't know the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.570 
example and even if you don't know the
notes<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.930> try<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> hear<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.950> sounds

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
notes you want to try to hear the sounds

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.750 
notes you want to try to hear the sounds
in<00:02:50.819> your<00:02:51.540> head<00:02:52.230> before<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.980> play<00:02:53.400> them<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
in your head before you play them on the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.050 
in your head before you play them on the
piano<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.810> let's<00:02:55.049> say<00:02:55.380> take<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> first<00:02:56.760> few

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
piano so let's say take the first few

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.270 
piano so let's say take the first few
notes<00:02:57.209> see<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.260> don't<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.769> what<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.099> next

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
notes see and I don't know what the next

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.020 
notes see and I don't know what the next
note<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> try<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.360> pitch<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.930> low<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.340> I'm

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
note is so I try to pitch it low and I'm

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.970 
note is so I try to pitch it low and I'm
not<00:03:09.269> sure<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.780> note<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.410> just<00:03:10.650> play

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
not sure what that note is so just play

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.229 
not sure what that note is so just play
around<00:03:11.100> with<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.519> few<00:03:11.609> notes<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.970> might<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
around with a few notes it might be a

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.330 
around with a few notes it might be a
note<00:03:12.450> higher<00:03:12.930> than<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:13.980> might<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.190> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
note higher than the a or it might be a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.819 
note higher than the a or it might be a
note<00:03:14.549> lower<00:03:14.880> than<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.440> that's<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> note

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
note lower than the a that's the note

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.220 
note lower than the a that's the note
that<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> want<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.640> then<00:03:18.000> sing<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.510> next<00:03:18.810> note

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that I want and then sing the next note

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.610 
that I want and then sing the next note
out<00:03:19.530> LA<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.299> think<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.019> note<00:03:22.200> below

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
out LA which I think is the note below

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.699 
out LA which I think is the note below
the<00:03:22.799> G<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.079> when<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> look<00:03:25.500> at<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the G and so on so when you look at a

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.890 
the G and so on so when you look at a
piece<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:25.950> music<00:03:26.450> eventually<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.569> should<00:03:27.600> be

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
piece of music eventually you should be

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.890 
piece of music eventually you should be
able<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.340> look<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.609> sounds<00:03:30.120> hear<00:03:30.630> them<00:03:30.810> in

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
able to look at the sounds hear them in

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.610 
able to look at the sounds hear them in
your<00:03:31.019> head<00:03:31.260> before<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.340> play<00:03:32.639> them<00:03:33.620> another

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
your head before you play them another

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.660 
your head before you play them another
useful<00:03:34.950> exercise<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.920> tapping<00:03:37.920> out<00:03:38.100> rhythms

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
useful exercise is tapping out rhythms

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.890 
useful exercise is tapping out rhythms
now<00:03:38.790> when<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.000> talk<00:03:39.150> about<00:03:39.209> tapping<00:03:39.780> out

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
now when you talk about tapping out

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.090 
now when you talk about tapping out
rhythms<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.500> well<00:03:40.590> what's<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.829> got

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
rhythms you think well what's that got

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220 
rhythms you think well what's that got
to<00:03:41.160> do<00:03:41.519> with<00:03:41.549> oral<00:03:41.970> training<00:03:42.420> well<00:03:42.660> oral
