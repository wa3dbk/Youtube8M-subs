with the sound man so what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:37.539> switch<00:00:37.870> over<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.379> this<00:00:38.589> 12<00:00:39.579> string

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
I'll switch over to this 12 string

Breedlove<00:00:43.510> signature<00:00:44.289> 12<00:00:44.589> string<00:00:44.920> they<00:00:45.039> were

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
Breedlove signature 12 string they were

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.239 
Breedlove signature 12 string they were
kind<00:00:45.399> enough<00:00:45.639> to<00:00:45.699> make<00:00:45.969> for<00:00:46.299> me<00:00:46.479> and<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:48.039> now<00:00:48.190> I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
kind enough to make for me and so now I

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.119 
kind enough to make for me and so now I
can<00:00:48.429> take<00:00:48.639> this<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.359> pop<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.839> in<00:00:50.139> the

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
can take this and pop that in the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.360 
can take this and pop that in the
soundhole<00:00:51.549> turn<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:53.519> good<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.639> go<00:00:54.789> so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.100 

one<00:00:57.760> thing<00:00:57.940> I'd<00:00:58.060> like<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.240> talk<00:00:58.510> about<00:00:58.720> on<00:00:58.990> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
one thing I'd like to talk about on the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.280 
one thing I'd like to talk about on the
12-string<00:00:59.740> is<00:00:59.920> this<00:01:00.220> particular<00:01:01.180> model<00:01:01.990> that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
12-string is this particular model that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.070 
12-string is this particular model that
Breedlove<00:01:02.710> made<00:01:02.950> for<00:01:03.220> me<00:01:03.400> I've<00:01:03.610> been

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
Breedlove made for me I've been

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.210 
Breedlove made for me I've been
preferring<00:01:05.080> as<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.530> usually<00:01:05.710> do<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.040> a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
preferring as I usually do on a

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.030 
preferring as I usually do on a
12-string<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:07.290> particular<00:01:08.290> set<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.590> strings

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
12-string a particular set of strings

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.910 
12-string a particular set of strings
that<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.430> derry-o<00:01:09.790> has<00:01:10.030> called<00:01:10.330> ej<00:01:10.750> 37's<00:01:11.740> and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
that the derry-o has called ej 37's and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.040 
that the derry-o has called ej 37's and
i<00:01:12.490> helped<00:01:12.729> them<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.150> design<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.810> and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
i helped them to design that and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.990 
i helped them to design that and
starting<00:01:14.650> from<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.860> first<00:01:15.280> string<00:01:15.610> up<00:01:15.790> that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
starting from the first string up that's

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.780 
starting from the first string up that's
a<00:01:16.119> 12<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:17.410> low<00:01:17.590> base<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:18.040> believe<00:01:18.310> goes<00:01:18.520> through

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
a 12 the low base I believe goes through

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.170 
a 12 the low base I believe goes through
53<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> particular<00:01:21.250> trick<00:01:21.850> about<00:01:22.000> this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
53 but the particular trick about this

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.560 
53 but the particular trick about this
is<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:22.780> my<00:01:22.960> fifth<00:01:23.200> string<00:01:23.530> octave<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.150> 22

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
is on my fifth string octave I have a 22

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.310 
is on my fifth string octave I have a 22
wound<00:01:26.050> string<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.760> believe<00:01:28.090> my<00:01:28.360> low<00:01:28.810> six

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
wound string then I believe my low six

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.710 
wound string then I believe my low six
string<00:01:29.560> octave<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.070> thirty<00:01:30.430> wound<00:01:30.790> but<00:01:31.570> if

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
string octave is a thirty wound but if

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.270 
string octave is a thirty wound but if
you're<00:01:31.869> hitting<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.140> fourth<00:01:32.470> string<00:01:32.800> octave

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
you're hitting the fourth string octave

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.420 
you're hitting the fourth string octave
and<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.330> hit<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.540> high<00:01:35.350> sounding<00:01:35.950> note<00:01:36.190> like

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
and you hit a high sounding note like

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.180 
and you hit a high sounding note like
that<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:37.570> exactly<00:01:37.810> what<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.380> do<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:38.860> want

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
that that's exactly what I do not want

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.060 
that that's exactly what I do not want
when<00:01:39.580> I'm<00:01:39.700> hitting<00:01:39.910> my<00:01:40.149> fifth<00:01:40.420> string<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.140> want

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
when I'm hitting my fifth string I want

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.980 
when I'm hitting my fifth string I want
more<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.430> thump<00:01:42.790> or<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> thunk<00:01:43.360> there<00:01:43.660> because

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
more of a thump or a thunk there because

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.510 
more of a thump or a thunk there because
I<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.350> that's<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> nature<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.280> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
I think that's more the nature of the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.790 
I think that's more the nature of the
instrument<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.810> when<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:46.990> had<00:01:47.200> this<00:01:47.350> Ghidorah

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
instrument so when I had this Ghidorah

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.969 
instrument so when I had this Ghidorah
designed<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.490> was<00:01:48.670> using<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.149> jumbo<00:01:49.570> body<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
designed I was using a jumbo body the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.130 
designed I was using a jumbo body the
same<00:01:51.190> pickup<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:51.820> m1<00:01:52.210> pickup<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.840> then<00:01:52.960> with

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
same pickup this m1 pickup and then with

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.630 
same pickup this m1 pickup and then with
this<00:01:53.289> set<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.619> strings<00:01:53.979> on<00:01:54.250> there<00:01:54.399> it's<00:01:54.550> a

this set of strings on there it's a

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.880 
this set of strings on there it's a
little<00:01:54.789> bit<00:01:54.940> heavier<00:01:55.360> gauge<00:01:55.660> then<00:01:56.590> maybe

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
little bit heavier gauge then maybe

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.830 
little bit heavier gauge then maybe
normally<00:01:57.399> comes<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> twelve<00:01:58.240> string<00:01:58.509> but

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
normally comes on a twelve string but

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.300

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
then I'd like to pitch the whole guitar

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.630 
then I'd like to pitch the whole guitar
down<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.929> a<00:02:01.990> half<00:02:02.170> steps<00:02:02.590> sometimes<00:02:03.459> I'll

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
little dark there but in particular I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.290 
little dark there but in particular I
like<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.200> go<00:02:08.319> down<00:02:08.369> maybe<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.729> one<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.149> half

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
like to go down maybe one one and a half

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.570 
like to go down maybe one one and a half
steps<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:14.470> more<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.860> nature<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
steps and that's more the nature of the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.880 
steps and that's more the nature of the
instrument<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.360> I'm<00:02:16.569> after<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.800> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
instrument that I'm after more of a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.699 
instrument that I'm after more of a
rhythmic<00:02:18.130> kind<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.270> propulsive<00:02:19.690> sound<00:02:20.290> so

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
rhythmic kind of propulsive sound so

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.449 
rhythmic kind of propulsive sound so
interesting<00:02:22.640> thing<00:02:22.849> about<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:24.459> 12-string

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.150 
interesting thing about this 12-string
is<00:02:25.640> when<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:25.970> play<00:02:26.360> my<00:02:27.200> harmonics<00:02:27.860> there's<00:02:28.099> a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
is when I play my harmonics there's a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.800 
is when I play my harmonics there's a
certain<00:02:28.670> way<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.849> like<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.269> try<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.660> bounce

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.000 
certain way I like to try and bounce
them<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.930> equate<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.800> when<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
them and the way I equate that is when I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.570 
them and the way I equate that is when I
play<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> note<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.780> instant<00:02:36.379> I<00:02:36.560> strike<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.190> with

play a note the instant I strike it with
a<00:02:37.879> finger<00:02:38.330> or<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> thumb<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.280> act<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.910> guess

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.970 
an analogy would be if I ignited the
string<00:02:43.519> like<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.819> hot<00:02:44.060> stove<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> instant<00:02:45.890> I

touch<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.610> want<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:47.000> release<00:02:47.330> my<00:02:47.629> finger

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
touch it I want to release my finger

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.740 
touch it I want to release my finger
obviously<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.670> release<00:02:50.000> my<00:02:50.209> finger<00:02:50.269> too

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
soon I get a note if I keep it down too

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.240 
soon I get a note if I keep it down too
long<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:55.400> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.849> thud<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.190> how<00:02:58.190> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
long I get kind of a thud so how you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.339 
long I get kind of a thud so how you
target<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.150> release<00:02:59.510> time<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.170> crucial<00:03:02.349> so

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
target the release time is crucial so

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.930 
target the release time is crucial so
just<00:03:03.590> pretend<00:03:03.769> as<00:03:04.069> soon<00:03:04.220> as<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.489> strike<00:03:04.790> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
just pretend as soon as you strike it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.729 
just pretend as soon as you strike it
you're<00:03:05.060> igniting<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.690> hot<00:03:05.930> stove<00:03:06.319> so

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
you're igniting that hot stove so

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.890 
you're igniting that hot stove so

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
that point because I wanted to point out

am<00:04:59.919> i<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.990> every<00:05:01.990> time<00:05:02.229> I<00:05:02.259> hit<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.620> note<00:05:02.860> I

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
am i and every time I hit a note I

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.000 
am i and every time I hit a note I
released<00:05:04.389> that<00:05:04.539> I'm<00:05:04.900> letting<00:05:05.080> my<00:05:05.320> finger<00:05:05.680> flat

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
released that I'm letting my finger flat

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.990 
released that I'm letting my finger flat
to<00:05:06.760> purposely<00:05:07.360> create<00:05:07.810> some<00:05:08.229> mutes<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.820> that

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
to purposely create some mutes so that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.850 
to purposely create some mutes so that
all<00:05:10.150> these<00:05:10.330> harmonics<00:05:10.630> don't<00:05:11.289> jangle

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
all these harmonics don't jangle

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.770 
all these harmonics don't jangle
together<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:12.880> gives<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:13.150> little<00:05:13.360> bit<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.630> a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
together and it gives a little bit of a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.020 
together and it gives a little bit of a
separation<00:05:14.320> in<00:05:14.889> between

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.090 

then<00:05:19.570> when<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.780> go<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.020> my<00:05:20.200> seventh<00:05:20.620> fret<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:20.890> use

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
then when I go to my seventh fret I use

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.820 
then when I go to my seventh fret I use
my<00:05:21.310> index<00:05:21.670> finger<00:05:22.150> and<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:23.020> want<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.290> target<00:05:23.500> my

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
my index finger and I want to target my

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.080 
my index finger and I want to target my
low<00:05:24.070> base<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:24.670> there

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
low base so there

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.760 
low base so there
I'll<00:05:25.420> change<00:05:25.780> five<00:05:26.170> to<00:05:26.440> six<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.600> back<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.620> my

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
I'll change five to six and back to my

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.810 
I'll change five to six and back to my
12th<00:05:30.160> fret<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:31.740> then<00:05:32.740> when<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:32.950> shift<00:05:33.310> my<00:05:33.460> right

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
12th fret and then when I shift my right

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.910 
12th fret and then when I shift my right
hand<00:05:34.120> down<00:05:34.390> back<00:05:34.720> into<00:05:34.990> position<00:05:35.140> one<00:05:35.710> on

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
hand down back into position one on

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.140 
hand down back into position one on
strings<00:05:36.280> three<00:05:36.550> two<00:05:36.760> one<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:38.760> try<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.820> get<00:05:39.940> my

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
strings three two one I try and get my

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.600 
strings three two one I try and get my
thumb<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.810> go<00:05:40.960> five<00:05:41.290> four<00:05:41.740> three<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.450> you

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
thumb to go five four three so that you

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.070 
thumb to go five four three so that you
you<00:05:45.610> notice<00:05:45.970> when<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.180> come<00:05:46.420> down<00:05:46.450> with<00:05:46.930> my

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
you notice when I come down with my

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.800 
you notice when I come down with my
thumb<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.650> third<00:05:47.860> note<00:05:48.220> I'm<00:05:48.810> targeting

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
thumb on the third note I'm targeting

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.230 
thumb on the third note I'm targeting
that<00:05:50.110> octave<00:05:50.680> string<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.310> 3rd<00:05:51.520> string<00:05:51.790> octave

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
that octave string the 3rd string octave

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.090 
that octave string the 3rd string octave
there<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.690> get<00:05:52.840> kind<00:05:53.140> of<00:05:53.200> a<00:05:53.350> ping<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.770> higher

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
there to get kind of a ping a higher

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.980 
there to get kind of a ping a higher
note

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.400 

and<00:05:58.139> then<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.530> use<00:05:58.680> middle<00:05:59.039> and<00:05:59.160> ring<00:06:00.410> this

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
and then I use middle and ring this

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.320 
and then I use middle and ring this
sound<00:06:01.710> kind<00:06:01.949> of<00:06:02.009> like<00:06:02.100> church<00:06:02.460> bells<00:06:02.819> on<00:06:03.180> the

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
sound kind of like church bells on the

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.510 
sound kind of like church bells on the
second<00:06:03.660> first<00:06:03.900> string<00:06:04.229> there

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.670 

and<00:06:08.970> then<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.180> do<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.449> same<00:06:09.479> thing<00:06:09.900> at<00:06:10.020> fret<00:06:10.289> 7

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
and then I do the same thing at fret 7

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.050 
and then I do the same thing at fret 7
and<00:06:10.830> then<00:06:10.919> when<00:06:11.039> I<00:06:11.069> come<00:06:11.340> back<00:06:11.520> up<00:06:11.759> on<00:06:11.940> the

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
and then when I come back up on the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.189 
and then when I come back up on the
third<00:06:12.240> pass<00:06:12.509> through<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:15.360> first<00:06:15.569> four<00:06:15.930> notes

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
third pass through the first four notes

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.100 
third pass through the first four notes
our<00:06:16.500> sixteenth<00:06:17.069> notes<00:06:17.370> is<00:06:17.610> counted<00:06:18.030> 1e<00:06:18.569> and

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.499 

and<00:06:22.620> a<00:06:22.740> couple<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.189> pinches<00:06:23.490> after<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.270> but

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
and a couple of pinches after that but

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.999 
and a couple of pinches after that but
when<00:06:24.629> I<00:06:24.659> do<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:24.990> sixteenth<00:06:25.470> notes<00:06:25.800> you'll

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
when I do the sixteenth notes you'll

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.820 
when I do the sixteenth notes you'll
notice<00:06:26.370> I've<00:06:27.330> got<00:06:27.599> no<00:06:27.780> choice<00:06:28.050> but<00:06:28.349> to<00:06:28.409> lay<00:06:28.620> my

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
notice I've got no choice but to lay my

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.309 
notice I've got no choice but to lay my
finger<00:06:28.889> flat<00:06:29.580> it's<00:06:29.909> almost<00:06:30.270> just<00:06:30.449> too<00:06:30.870> much<00:06:31.080> to

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
finger flat it's almost just too much to

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.469 
finger flat it's almost just too much to
release<00:06:31.680> it<00:06:31.949> and<00:06:32.129> bring<00:06:32.759> it<00:06:32.879> back<00:06:33.060> down<00:06:33.270> in

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
release it and bring it back down in

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.209 
release it and bring it back down in
that<00:06:33.599> timeframe<00:06:33.930> so<00:06:34.289> I<00:06:34.500> don't<00:06:34.710> mind<00:06:34.860> a<00:06:34.979> little

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
that timeframe so I don't mind a little

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.429 
that timeframe so I don't mind a little
bit<00:06:35.340> of<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.550> thud<00:06:35.849> there<00:06:36.270> it<00:06:36.840> also<00:06:36.990> gives<00:06:37.319> a

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
bit of a thud there it also gives a

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.200 
bit of a thud there it also gives a
little<00:06:37.469> bit<00:06:37.770> of<00:06:37.889> a<00:06:37.979> depth<00:06:38.219> to<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:38.580> harmonics

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
little bit of a depth to the harmonics

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.499 
little bit of a depth to the harmonics
and<00:06:39.680> it<00:06:40.680> allows<00:06:40.949> the<00:06:41.219> 2nd<00:06:41.610> and<00:06:41.729> 1st<00:06:41.879> strings<00:06:42.270> to

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
and it allows the 2nd and 1st strings to

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.119 
and it allows the 2nd and 1st strings to
chime<00:06:42.780> out<00:06:42.810> a<00:06:43.050> little<00:06:43.259> bit<00:06:43.500> more<00:06:43.650> so<00:06:43.830> it's<00:06:43.949> nice

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
chime out a little bit more so it's nice

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.659 
chime out a little bit more so it's nice
to<00:06:44.460> almost<00:06:45.330> accidentally<00:06:46.169> create<00:06:46.949> that<00:06:47.189> 3d

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
to almost accidentally create that 3d

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.790 
to almost accidentally create that 3d
effect<00:06:47.699> because<00:06:48.449> you're<00:06:48.599> forced<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.139> cut<00:06:49.620> it

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
effect because you're forced to cut it

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.300 
effect because you're forced to cut it
here<00:06:50.219> on<00:06:50.930> 543<00:06:51.930> then<00:06:52.169> bring<00:06:52.379> the<00:06:52.500> chime<00:06:52.800> out<00:06:53.009> and

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
here on 543 then bring the chime out and

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.420 
here on 543 then bring the chime out and
you<00:06:53.849> can<00:06:54.000> see<00:06:54.180> how<00:06:54.330> it<00:06:54.509> builds<00:06:54.930> but<00:06:55.169> once<00:06:56.129> again

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
you can see how it builds but once again

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.520 
you can see how it builds but once again
watch<00:06:56.699> the<00:06:56.940> angle<00:06:57.360> of<00:06:57.479> your<00:06:57.629> finger<00:06:58.080> watch<00:06:58.289> the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
watch the angle of your finger watch the

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.320 
watch the angle of your finger watch the
timing<00:06:58.800> of<00:06:59.039> the<00:06:59.159> release<00:06:59.310> and<00:06:59.849> see<00:06:59.969> if<00:07:00.060> you<00:07:00.180> can

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
timing of the release and see if you can

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.350 
timing of the release and see if you can
use<00:07:00.360> harmonics<00:07:01.110> in<00:07:01.289> the<00:07:01.379> tune<00:07:01.560> of<00:07:01.740> your<00:07:01.860> own

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
use harmonics in the tune of your own

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.840 
use harmonics in the tune of your own
good<00:07:03.360> luck<00:07:03.539> to<00:07:03.719> you
