00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
really cool effect for the perk when you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
really cool effect for the perk when you
stab<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> zombie<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.379> damaged

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
stab a zombie they will get damaged

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700 
stab a zombie they will get damaged
slowly<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.810> poison<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.560> what's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
slowly over time like a poison so what's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920 
slowly over time like a poison so what's
so<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.070> almost<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.090> player<00:01:09.420> becomes

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so it's almost like the player becomes

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
so it's almost like the player becomes
the<00:01:10.170> bee<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:11.130> knife<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> almost<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the bee and your knife is almost like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.630 
the bee and your knife is almost like
the<00:01:12.030> sting<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.500> stabbed<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:14.070> they

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the sting so you stabbed them they

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
the sting so you stabbed them they
slowly<00:01:14.939> lose<00:01:15.240> health<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> keep

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
slowly lose health and you know you keep

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460 
slowly lose health and you know you keep
getting<00:01:17.189> points<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.790> i'm<00:01:17.880> guessing<00:01:18.470> also

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
getting points for it i'm guessing also

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
getting points for it i'm guessing also
there<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.799> side<00:01:20.189> effect<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.820> he<00:01:20.970> came<00:01:21.450> up

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there is a side effect that he came up

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.740 
there is a side effect that he came up
with<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.610> zombie<00:01:23.939> hits<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
with and that is if a zombie hits you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.440 
with and that is if a zombie hits you
they<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.500> die<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> bee<00:01:26.549> dies<00:01:26.759> after<00:01:27.090> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
they will die like a bee dies after they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
they will die like a bee dies after they
sting<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.810> which<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.040> cool<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.520> like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sting you which is pretty cool i like

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
sting you which is pretty cool i like
that<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.420> i'm<00:01:30.540> guessing<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.229> basically<00:01:31.740> like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that so i'm guessing it's basically like

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.330 
that so i'm guessing it's basically like
if<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.790> zombie<00:01:32.939> hits<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.409> zombie<00:01:34.860> does<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
if a zombie hits you the zombie does the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
if a zombie hits you the zombie does the
damage<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.509> dies<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.259> afterwards

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
damage but it also dies right afterwards

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.249 
damage but it also dies right afterwards
like<00:01:38.220> its<00:01:38.460> stinger<00:01:38.790> fell<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.509> i<00:01:39.810> think

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like its stinger fell out so i think

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
like its stinger fell out so i think
that's<00:01:40.500> cool<00:01:40.799> i'm<00:01:41.729> guessing<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.240> perks<00:01:42.600> gonna

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that's cool i'm guessing the perks gonna

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
that's cool i'm guessing the perks gonna
have<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> cost<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> money<00:01:43.829> maybe<00:01:44.189> 4,000

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
have to cost a lot of money maybe 4,000

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.899 
have to cost a lot of money maybe 4,000
points<00:01:45.030> maybe<00:01:45.720> 5,000<00:01:46.640> somewhere<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> high

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
points maybe 5,000 somewhere in the high

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.280 
points maybe 5,000 somewhere in the high
ranges<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:48.990> cool<00:01:49.200> effect

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
ranges because it's a really cool effect

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.830 
ranges because it's a really cool effect
and<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.579> customized<00:01:51.060> perk<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.689> takes

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and it's a customized perk so it takes

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
and it's a customized perk so it takes
time<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> make<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.460> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> make<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
time to make it and you want to make it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.740 
time to make it and you want to make it
cost<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.790> harder<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.820> get<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.719> i

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cost more so it's harder to get but i

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350
