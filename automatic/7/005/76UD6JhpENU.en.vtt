00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
whole time but I mean obviously I think

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.590 
whole time but I mean obviously I think
the<00:03:01.260> Avengers<00:03:02.010> 2<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.790> gonna<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.420> after

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the Avengers 2 is gonna be right after

the Avengers 2 is gonna be right after
the<00:03:03.840> winter<00:03:03.990> soldier<00:03:04.260> story<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.640> know

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the winter soldier story so and I know

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.880 
the winter soldier story so and I know
that<00:03:06.030> Hawkeye<00:03:06.480> has<00:03:07.140> something<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.770> with

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
that Hawkeye has something to do with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010 
that Hawkeye has something to do with
ink<00:03:08.370> breaking<00:03:08.760> out<00:03:08.910> Quicksilver<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:09.870> Scarlet

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
ink breaking out Quicksilver and Scarlet

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.950 
ink breaking out Quicksilver and Scarlet
Witch<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.490> mean<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.300> by<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
Witch so I mean that's just going by the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.630 
Witch so I mean that's just going by the
set<00:03:13.200> photos<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.710> videos<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.220> actually<00:03:14.490> see

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
set photos and videos we actually see

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.820 
set photos and videos we actually see
just<00:03:14.910> three<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.450> three<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.690> them<00:03:15.900> somewhere

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
just three the three of them somewhere

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.340 
just three the three of them somewhere
