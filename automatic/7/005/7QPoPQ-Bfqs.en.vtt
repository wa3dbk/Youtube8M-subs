 Good, you're going to get the middle way. 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:12.090
 solder here or in this somewhat 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.269

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.670
 positive wire 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:36.829

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.370
 Let's get a put here to give more 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 a space puts the serve but even 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 so with the bill that leaves my uniform 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 this distance that has more or less 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 seven thousand subscribers 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:14.250
 then put tape here you can 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:16.940
 insert the cold here again 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.940
 positive 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:29.930
 so you're going to lean here on the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.930
 It is the tape and all espacinhos 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.060

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.780

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.220
 ae 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:57.520

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.410
 you want with 14 a cart you stay 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.009

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:19.870
 A knife, an alloy key, and off. 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:22.150
 So you want to turn the TV on and lean against it. 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.349
 want to call 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:33.789

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.900
 in this middle nest and only in the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.479
 or you just just rolled into the 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.349

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:06.159
 Who 's good is going to have a little time left? 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.120
 the other side leaves the sector makes its 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.360
 choice 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.620
 You pick up a wire runs on anyone. 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:22.349

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.349
 the supply at source will be negative 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.220
 If you had it here, you could also 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.220
 uniform in the distance 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:07:01.030
 you place here is the largest source of 12 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:07:01.030
