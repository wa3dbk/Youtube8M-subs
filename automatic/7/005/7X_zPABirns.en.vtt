 minecraft almost every day and good 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.820
 I bring you this time a tutorial of how 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
 accelerate the minecraft to 100% and not have 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 black unless you have a computer 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.039
 very slow well I have a very compu 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 slow but the minecraft runs me 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.660
 perfectly when I do not record but 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 when I record it gives me a little bit sometimes 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.789
 up to 30 fps is but we're going to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 start with the good tutorial here 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.250
 runs at 30 fps if I do not get low 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 they come or because I run 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 and well let's see how how to put the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.100
 minecraft we give you options video 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.059
 settings and in graphics I'll leave it in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 fat because in fancy he had a lot 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 render distance we leave you in tiny 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 because they will have it once that normal 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 we leave in training small die that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 we leave off 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.050
 performance we leave you the maximum of fps 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.640
 here do not click on the coffe here on 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.300
 the view butch vig booking with here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.090
 in scale in good and with some scouts 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.399
 leave the car and here at open nfl something if 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.530
 we leave you in off in brightness we leave you 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.460
 up to the maximum because if we let him 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.070
 even in mode and it looks very dark in its 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.570
 blog we leave you in is mod approach that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.780
 here we leave you in nov 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.000
 as you want the approach is that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.860
 that I will live far away because it 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.920
 look further 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.750
 here the focus is left 0.8 in 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 detail we leave the clouds we leave you 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.270
 in off the leaves in fat the water in fat 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.980
 the sky on the moon and the sun on and off 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.200
 as you want me to activate it 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 because I know of chita the minecraft attends 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.710
 fox in on here is the distance from heaven 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.729
 but I leave you the grass, we leave it 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 in fat rain and snow we leave in fast 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.560
 star xenon or as you want 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.570
 this does not affect much minecraft but 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.040
 if you have it very varied activate all 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.360
 all sorry snow caps we leave you in the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.180
 item in off good one is quality here 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.840
 we all left here we all all 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 all and is away in minimum liniers 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.720
 if we have if we go to animations on 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.209
 I recommend that you activate them and 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.459
 the lava are the only two animations 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.880
 that deactivated so that it runs better 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.150
 the minecraft 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.070
 good in performance 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:51.480
 fps we left in with the farc in two their 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.250
 club but when we do not leave in one is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.430
 mod work on that says pray love tour of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.150
 and here are the textures this also in 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.780
 the different brought of textures that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.790
 you can change when you're playing is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 logical then change us and you have to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.269
 It is coming out that's not good 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.459
 change your textures if you run very 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.200
 side I recommend you download 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.209
 some textures of simply craft something like that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.910
 they're called textures and well let's 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.140

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.400
 for when you enter a server sometimes you 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.560
 says that if you want to download the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.420
 color server textures 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.520

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.410
