00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 The important thing now is to keep this idea 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.100
 of race and lots of soul inside the game 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.660
 How much can you help with this next one? 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.189
 game against corinthians 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.759
 this idea of ​​this race of this soul 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.080
 program has now implanted felipão 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.609
 when it is assumed the guild is the first 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.279
 first request he made to us 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.529
 For us, this is what we 're going to do. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.289
 this spirit that spirit of the guild 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 delivery spirit the 90 minutes of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.429
 a lot of will determination is that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 the results will start to happen 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.469
 so it's show when the cruise was a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 example of this type of team attitude 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.649
 and we 're going to try to do it now, and if 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 deliver the most as we always do 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.290
 Come on, get the 90 minutes. 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 winning with a whole group surrendering is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 tactical part and look for the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.050
 make the goals that is what goes of the victory 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.670
 in the next games had an evolution 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.800
 ramiro da grêmio in this last game 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 against the cruise already designing 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.020
 which is also difficult as well as 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.520
 was in minas gerais against corinthians 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
 I think I think we did. 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.640
 a match there is a very good match 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.880
 tactically defensively is we were 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 Very well and when we have the ball, let's go 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.850
 exploit the attacks against both 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.299
 we created several chances of goal 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.369
 so the team comes is taking a model 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.240
 a drawing with the filipe teacher and is 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.610
 Continue 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 it is in this rhythm following with 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 always evolving every game and every 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.509
 training to the moment that people 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 arrive at the teacher see iran a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.470
 smile on his obvious arrival has 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.390
 joy in the neighborhood is recovered and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.979
 able to return to play is what is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 evident you most like to be 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.850
 doing and coming back at the moment he is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.079
 in a transitional phase, so let's 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.210
 made a great game for example not 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.799
 achieved the result and tomorrow there is more 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 a great rival that the Corinthians 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:59.100
 obviously happy to start getting 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.219
 the victory that we are needing because 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.799
 We're playing one for one thing. 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.509
 or else we made no mistake and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.039
 already take aim né 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.440
 so we have to do a little bit 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.750
 tomorrow in Nyon and also capricha 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.530
 what happens 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.030
 No one who does it has not changed the team is 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.620
 a game to the other and all 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.960
 how are you guys seeing these 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.280
 changes changes that he even desire 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.870
 but also change that he is required to 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.990
 do as in this case has three 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.970
 I think it's normal there. 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.560
 doing now is what you want too 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.500
 opportunity the world knew everything 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.070
 world then it's normal here that it looks 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.730
 has change came the luan and and I 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.560
 jo understand is we're accepting 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.720
 very well 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.239
 We always talk here does not have a headline. 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.470
 nor if the customer is taking Brazil 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.209
 anton 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.209
 We have to accept what the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.070
 coach wants the marks as much as you 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.230
 was left out rodolfo was the captain 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.090
 you are the body of the leaders shows 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.920
 this leadership and rhodolph after the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.080
 game against the cruise ended up admitting 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 the crime was a bit juvenile in the game 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.489
 against the cruise in that move thinks that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.140
 Missed a bit of program maturity 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.400
 within 90 minutes 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.260
 around a little to keep it quiet 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.860
 kill the game 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.799
 another day and 40 minutes per agent 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.130
 cut hasan that left the goal cut him 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.470
 the avaí in china but I did not think for 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.580
 What happens then? 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.440
 learn 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.440
 I was cutting the game at the right time.
