00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you know a lot of products do that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
you know a lot of products do that
already<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.850> throw

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
already but what they do is they throw

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.729 
already but what they do is they throw
in<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:39.960> decent<00:00:41.180> fat<00:00:42.180> loss<00:00:42.390> aids<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.290> instead

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in some decent fat loss aids so instead

in some decent fat loss aids so instead
of<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> call<00:00:44.579> pixie<00:00:45.059> dusting<00:00:45.480> a

maybe if you're lucky some l-carnitine
and<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.430> try<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.789> play<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> off<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.570> a

and they try and play it off as a as a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
and they try and play it off as a as a
fat<00:00:51.840> loss<00:00:51.930> product<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> may<00:00:52.980> be

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
fat loss product this because it may be

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
fat loss product this because it may be
extra<00:00:53.370> step<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.020> actually

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
extra step to go okay what actually

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.110 
extra step to go okay what actually
addresses<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> they're<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.640> lucky<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
addresses this and they're very lucky to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
addresses this and they're very lucky to
have<00:00:57.149> their<00:00:57.600> rig<00:00:58.020> formula<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.920> take

have their rig formula they can take

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.849 
have their rig formula they can take
some<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.170> non-stimulant<00:01:01.170> aids<00:01:01.410> element

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
some of the non-stimulant aids element

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
some of the non-stimulant aids element
and<00:01:01.949> put<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.969> soup<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.780> with

a couple extra non-stimulant aids as

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
a couple extra non-stimulant aids as
well<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.260> reason<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> keep<00:01:07.710> saying<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
well the reason I keep saying on

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
well the reason I keep saying on
stimulant<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.049> protein<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
stimulant is that was protein you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.600 
stimulant is that was protein you
wouldnt<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.680> able<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> take<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> any<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wouldnt be able to take it any time of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.179 
wouldnt be able to take it any time of
the<00:01:11.640> day<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> evening<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the day even in the evening and you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.380 
the day even in the evening and you
don't<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.520> stimulants<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.150> keep<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
don't want stimulants that will keep you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
don't want stimulants that will keep you
awake<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.380> those<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:16.740> powerful<00:01:17.070> earlier

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
awake so those are very powerful earlier

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
awake so those are very powerful earlier
in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> day<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> produce<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.689> key<00:01:18.840> hormones

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
in the day to produce the key hormones

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
in the day to produce the key hormones
and<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:19.830> pre-workout<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.970> expend

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and good pre-workout to make you expend

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
and good pre-workout to make you expend
more<00:01:21.900> energy<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:23.009> better<00:01:23.130> results<00:01:23.509> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
more energy and get better results but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
more energy and get better results but
to<00:01:24.689> address<00:01:25.070> quality<00:01:26.070> protein<00:01:26.490> sources

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to address quality protein sources

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.030 
to address quality protein sources
there's<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.900> 25<00:01:28.290> grams<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.710> protein<00:01:29.009> per

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there's about 25 grams of protein per

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's about 25 grams of protein per
scoop<00:01:29.250> minimum<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.119> equivalent<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
scoop minimum so that's equivalent to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710 
scoop minimum so that's equivalent to
sort<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> four<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.770> five<00:01:31.890> colleagues<00:01:32.720> without

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sort of four or five colleagues without

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.620 
sort of four or five colleagues without
all<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> fat<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.259> cholesterol<00:01:35.180> like<00:01:36.180> yummy

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
all the fat and cholesterol like yummy

frequent snacks because most people will
know<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.900> protein<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.830> your<00:02:52.860> three

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
know that protein of your three

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.910 
know that protein of your three
macronutrients<00:02:53.720> effect<00:02:54.720> cabs<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.230> protein

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
macronutrients effect cabs and protein

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
macronutrients effect cabs and protein
proteins<00:02:56.520> very<00:02:56.670> difficult<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.600> convert

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
proteins very difficult to a convert

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.640 
proteins very difficult to a convert
into<00:02:58.560> energy<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.820> fat<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.690> therefore<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.500> can

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
into energy or fat so therefore you can

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.900 
into energy or fat so therefore you can
control<00:03:02.010> your<00:03:02.190> appetite

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
control your appetite

control your appetite
you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.630> address<00:03:05.209> your<00:03:06.209> needs<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.600> recovery

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
you can address your needs of recovery

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.290 
you can address your needs of recovery
if<00:03:07.110> you're<00:03:07.260> doing<00:03:07.470> any<00:03:07.620> kind<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.890> exercise

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
if you're doing any kind of exercise

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.130 
if you're doing any kind of exercise
plus<00:03:09.300> you're<00:03:09.570> giving<00:03:09.780> yourself<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
plus you're giving yourself the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
plus you're giving yourself the
thermogenic<00:03:10.620> benefits<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.519> actually<00:03:11.970> burn

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
thermogenic benefits to actually burn

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560 
thermogenic benefits to actually burn
more<00:03:12.570> calories<00:03:12.959> doing<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.920> same<00:03:14.100> plan<00:03:14.570> so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
more calories doing the same plan so

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.110

that's<00:03:15.660> very<00:03:15.870> effectively<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.090> a
