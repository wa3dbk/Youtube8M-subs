 the traffic of vehicles between rondônia and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.559
 acre at night was suspended 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.590
 informed the spokesman alvarez of the 21st 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 oversight the water reaches prf 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.439
 a layer of 80 centimeters over the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 asphalt in localities known as 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 ancient mutum 177 km from 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 port and puts at risk the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 safety of drivers and passengers 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.120
 during the night because of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.850
 the section will be closed all 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.899
 nights until the river shows a sign of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 leakage 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.809
 with the measure the acre will be isolated from the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 the rest of the country about 12 hours 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.910
 every day traffic by site only 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 will be released from the 6 hours of the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 every morning while you stay 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.309
 the current level of the waters of the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.000
 my side inspector alvarez da prf 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.760
 inspector 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.399
 the main objective of the br 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.400
 meaning port old to here on the perimeter 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 the old mutuma being forbidden is 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 alarm cause 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.439
 look naturally like everyone has 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 accompanied to we have a blade 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.270
 that has a stretch is not practical 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 of practically one thousand meters in two by two is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 in two moments we have more than one 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.340
 kilometer practically a blade 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.369
 that until yesterday during the day she 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 was in the range of 60 and 70 cm 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.470
 depending on the depression until then we 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.210
 we are allowing is the flow is made to 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 night we already had a decision to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.759
 suspend like we did yesterday we did 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 yesterday 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.189
 only this morning and given to this 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 new rise is from the river increased this 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.820
 blade is to have a little bit of current 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 so for safety reasons we 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 we prevent traffic is until this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.869
 blade lowers a bit so we 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 can we do this heavy traffic 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.430
 of the cargo center with safety and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 I repeat important cargo vehicles that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.899
 the passenger vehicles is understand the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.219
 moment we 're seeing right 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.250
 we are giving priority to 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.790
 All types of cargo vehicles 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 food and fuel gas because it is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.760
 a very big concern 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.780
 ours is to be able to make it arrive 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.620
 to the acre né 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.950
 the genres for the population to be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.519
 stocked 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.769
 then whoever can postpone his 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.950
 travel by truck or see 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.480
 with the slightest it is that you do it and as soon 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.030
 this water will go down and we will go 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.860
 naturally resume the passage there 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.780
 guided by colleagues to the police 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.080
 dnit buses that are in the area there 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.420
 taking care of this stretch the level of br 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 in that stretch of the br where they are flooded 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.299
 comes to more or less than the height is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 this morning reached almost a 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.200
 depth of this blade of 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.739
 water why we take this 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 is to prevent the flow to 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.730
 download a little, right? 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.549
 and we can not take the risk that 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 Someone has an accident there and has 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.329
 consequences of notes what we 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.910
 We want it with the grace of God to pass. 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.099
 for this period of turbulence without 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.260
 no loss of human life 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.760
 It's okay thank you very much with pictures of 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 a sign of alencar rosinaldo guedes 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.609
 for police duty the first on the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.609
 tv in the people's preference
