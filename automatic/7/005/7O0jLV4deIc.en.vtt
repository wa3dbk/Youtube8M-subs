on my best lace leggings i had a while

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
ago and it was like a yak yak see
texture<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.299> exactly<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
texture here and this is exactly what it

reminds<00:01:37.079> me<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.159> even<00:01:38.340> shedding

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
reminds me of it's not even shedding

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.870 
reminds me of it's not even shedding
much<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:40.500> say<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.430> does<00:01:41.670> shed<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
much right now i will say it does shed a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.960 
much right now i will say it does shed a
little<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.450> after<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.729> flower<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
little bit more after you on flower on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
little bit more after you on flower on
it<00:01:45.090> though<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.619> while<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.740> brushing<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it though or while you're brushing it I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.850 
it though or while you're brushing it I
guess<00:01:48.360> simply<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
guess simply because you know all the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.240 
guess simply because you know all the
brush<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> angling<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.100> don't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
brush like that but it's angling I don't

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.819 
brush like that but it's angling I don't
have<00:01:53.460> any<00:01:53.640> tangles<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
have any tangles it's really really

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
have any tangles it's really really
really<00:01:55.950> soft<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.729> bone<00:01:57.090> bone<00:01:57.390> straight

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
really soft it's not bone bone straight

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
really soft it's not bone bone straight
and<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> didn't<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.070> want<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.119> know

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and I didn't really want it you know

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.709 
and I didn't really want it you know
it's<00:02:00.420> still<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:00.780> wavy<00:02:00.990> pieces<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it's still some wavy pieces in there in

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.420 
it's still some wavy pieces in there in
certain<00:02:04.020> places<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.439> over<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
certain places like over here but I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850 
certain places like over here but I
don't<00:02:05.520> mind<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> think

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
don't mind it at all really but I think

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
don't mind it at all really but I think
it<00:02:08.099> gives<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> more<00:02:08.580> natural<00:02:08.970> look<00:02:09.000> enough

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it gives it a more natural look enough

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.150 
it gives it a more natural look enough
and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.970

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
of my week stash but I'm actually this

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.110 
of my week stash but I'm actually this
is<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.880> think<00:03:02.910> my<00:03:03.240> fifth<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.660> sixth<00:03:03.960> time<00:03:03.990> buying

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
is I think my fifth or sixth time buying

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.640 
is I think my fifth or sixth time buying
this<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.480> way<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.530> different

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
this is that way just in a different

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.990 
this is that way just in a different
color<00:03:07.980> normally<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.670> get<00:03:08.880> into<00:03:09.150> color<00:03:09.360> 1b<00:03:11.000> not

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
color normally I get into color 1b not

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.760 
color normally I get into color 1b not
going<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.210> call<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.360> too<00:03:12.600> i<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.140> had<00:03:13.410> twice

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
going to call it too i have it had twice

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.460 
going to call it too i have it had twice
on<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.040> two<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:15.080> had<00:03:16.080> twice<00:03:16.500> them<00:03:16.860> blood<00:03:17.780> i<00:03:18.780> have

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
on the two i had twice them blood i have

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.280 
on the two i had twice them blood i have
the<00:03:19.680> red<00:03:19.860> color<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:20.520> i<00:03:20.820> had<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.330> blonde

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the red color and then i had a blonde

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.120 
the red color and then i had a blonde
brown<00:03:22.620> mixture<00:03:23.070> too<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.490> I<00:03:23.700> guess<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
brown mixture too so I guess this is a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.460 
brown mixture too so I guess this is a
six<00:03:26.130> wait<00:03:26.580> actually<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.330> they<00:03:28.080> hold<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.440> really

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
six wait actually in they hold up really

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.070 
six wait actually in they hold up really

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
well day it doesn't shed it hasn't lost

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.800 
well day it doesn't shed it hasn't lost

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
out in the front it probably will look

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.750
