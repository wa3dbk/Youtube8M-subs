okay<00:00:01.620> so<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> know<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.190> guys<00:00:02.280> did<00:00:02.490> color<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.820> cell

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay so I know you guys did color a cell

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.240 
okay so I know you guys did color a cell
when<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.510> wasn't<00:00:04.020> around<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.890> had<00:00:05.040> miss

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
when I wasn't around you had miss

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.550 
when I wasn't around you had miss
Ferrari<00:00:05.700> um<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.899> want<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> have

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Ferrari um but I do want you to have

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.169 
Ferrari um but I do want you to have
access<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.519> case<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.820> need<00:00:08.940> at<00:00:09.030> home

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
access to this in case you need at home

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
access to this in case you need at home
cuz<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.630> don't<00:00:09.780> all<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> sex<00:00:10.230> books

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
cuz I know you don't all have sex books

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.799 
cuz I know you don't all have sex books
um<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.670> over<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.420> have<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> nucleus

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
um so over here you have the nucleus

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.689 
um so over here you have the nucleus
over<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.190> vacuole<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.630> mitochondria

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
over here the vacuole the mitochondria

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
over here the vacuole the mitochondria
the<00:00:17.750> chloroplasts<00:00:18.750> which<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:19.020> always<00:00:19.260> bigger

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the chloroplasts which are always bigger

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.320 
the chloroplasts which are always bigger
than<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> mitochondria<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:21.060> you'll<00:00:21.210> learn

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
than the mitochondria which you'll learn

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
than the mitochondria which you'll learn
about<00:00:21.480> will<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.500> learned<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:22.920> because

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
about will have learned about because

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.679 
about will have learned about because
you'll<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.490> done<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> plant<00:00:24.119> cell<00:00:24.359> lab<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
you'll have done the plant cell lab and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
you'll have done the plant cell lab and
you<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.109> chloroplasts<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.070> can't

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you can see chloroplasts but you can't

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.519 
you can see chloroplasts but you can't
see<00:00:26.400> mitochondria<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.320> little

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
see mitochondria on the little little

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.910 
see mitochondria on the little little
dots<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> ribosomes<00:00:29.670> um<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.349> smooth

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
dots are the ribosomes um the smooth

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
dots are the ribosomes um the smooth
endoplasmic<00:00:32.450> reticulum<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> rough

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
endoplasmic reticulum and miss Ferrari I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.060 
endoplasmic reticulum and miss Ferrari I
left<00:00:36.719> me<00:00:36.840> note<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.410> always<00:00:37.559> attached

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
left me note these are always attached

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
left me note these are always attached
to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> nucleus<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.480> endoplasmic<00:00:39.750> reticulum

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to the nucleus the endoplasmic reticulum

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
to the nucleus the endoplasmic reticulum
is<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> nucleus<00:00:42.350> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is like right up on the nucleus the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
is like right up on the nucleus the
Golgi<00:00:43.649> apparatus<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> looks<00:00:44.850> similar

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
Golgi apparatus I know it looks similar

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
Golgi apparatus I know it looks similar
especially<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> picture<00:00:45.899> gets<00:00:46.079> smaller

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
especially when the picture gets smaller

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.610 
especially when the picture gets smaller
it's<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.190> attached<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> nucleus<00:00:48.480> um<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it's not attached to the nucleus um and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's not attached to the nucleus um and
then<00:00:49.739> microtubules<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.289> cell<00:00:52.289> membrane

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
then microtubules and the cell membrane

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
then microtubules and the cell membrane
and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.699> cell<00:00:53.730> wall<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.570> pretty

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and the cell wall which are pretty

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.029 
and the cell wall which are pretty
self-explanatory

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
self-explanatory

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
self-explanatory
um<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> cytoplasm<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> like

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
um and in the cytoplasm which is like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.130 
um and in the cytoplasm which is like
the<00:00:58.590> jello<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> holds<00:00:59.399> everything<00:00:59.730> together

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
the jello that holds everything together

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
the jello that holds everything together
um<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> functions<00:01:02.879> as

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
um so just so you have the functions as

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
um so just so you have the functions as
well<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.229> nucleus<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.860> part<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> cell

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
well the nucleus is the part of the cell

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
well the nucleus is the part of the cell
that<00:01:05.640> controls<00:01:06.030> growth<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.540> reproduction

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that controls growth and reproduction

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
that controls growth and reproduction
it's<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> brain<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> cell<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's like the brain of the cell all the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's like the brain of the cell all the
DNA<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> stored<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.670> mitochondria<00:01:12.360> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
DNA is stored here the mitochondria are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
DNA is stored here the mitochondria are
the<00:01:12.869> powerhouse<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> cell<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.159> they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the powerhouse of the cell so they

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390 
the powerhouse of the cell so they
process<00:01:14.700> food<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.420> energy<00:01:15.619> okay<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
process food for energy okay so this is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
process food for energy okay so this is
where<00:01:17.580> cellular<00:01:18.060> respiration<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
where cellular respiration is going to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
where cellular respiration is going to
take<00:01:19.170> place<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.220> your

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
take place because this is like your

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
take place because this is like your
power<00:01:20.610> plant<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> city<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
power plant if this was like a city and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.429 
power plant if this was like a city and
you<00:01:22.439> needed<00:01:22.680> energy<00:01:23.070> um<00:01:23.960> vacuoles<00:01:24.960> are

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you needed energy um vacuoles are

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
you needed energy um vacuoles are

them<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.090> animal<00:01:45.450> cells<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:46.049> used<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
them in animal cells are used to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
them in animal cells are used to
transport<00:01:46.710> proteins<00:01:47.220> throughout<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> cell

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
transport proteins throughout the cell

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.149 
transport proteins throughout the cell
and<00:01:48.240> also<00:01:48.540> provide<00:01:49.020> structure<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and also provide structure like a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
and also provide structure like a
highway<00:01:50.369> system<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.630> tell<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
highway system you can tell the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270 
highway system you can tell the
difference<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> rough<00:01:52.950> endoplasmic

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
difference because the rough endoplasmic

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
difference because the rough endoplasmic
reticulum<00:01:54.090> has<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.540> ribosomes<00:01:55.020> stuck<00:01:55.500> all

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
reticulum has little ribosomes stuck all

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
reticulum has little ribosomes stuck all
over<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> um<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.149> where<00:01:57.479> proteins

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
over it um and this is where proteins

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.389 
over it um and this is where proteins
are<00:01:58.110> made<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.530> where<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> genetic<00:01:58.920> code<00:01:59.280> from

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
are made so where the genetic code from

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
are made so where the genetic code from
the<00:01:59.520> nucleus<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> translated<00:02:00.600> into<00:02:00.780> proteins

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the nucleus is translated into proteins

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170 
the nucleus is translated into proteins
so<00:02:01.770> synthesis<00:02:02.250> meats<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.759> make<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so synthesis meats like to make so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.959 
so synthesis meats like to make so
you're<00:02:03.299> making<00:02:03.390> proteins<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you're making proteins and then the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
you're making proteins and then the
Golgi<00:02:06.270> apparatus<00:02:06.390> packages<00:02:06.780> those<00:02:07.439> proteins
