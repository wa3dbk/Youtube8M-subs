hey<00:00:02.550> guys<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:02.970> welcome<00:00:03.030> back<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.449> jax<00:00:04.170> tech

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hey guys and welcome back to jax tech

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey guys and welcome back to jax tech
today<00:00:04.920> we'll<00:00:05.190> be<00:00:05.220> looking<00:00:05.430> at<00:00:05.700> what<00:00:05.759> Colin

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
today we'll be looking at what Colin

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.100 
today we'll be looking at what Colin
versus<00:00:07.379> air<00:00:07.620> Colin<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:09.059> there's<00:00:09.510> only<00:00:09.660> really

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
versus air Colin so there's only really

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.789 
versus air Colin so there's only really
two<00:00:10.440> major<00:00:11.070> contenders<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:13.110> wall<00:00:13.320> calling

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
two major contenders on the wall calling

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
two major contenders on the wall calling
side<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.219> things<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:15.360> could<00:00:15.509> argue<00:00:15.690> NZXT<00:00:16.590> with

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
side of things you could argue NZXT with

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.210 
side of things you could argue NZXT with
a<00:00:17.130> Kraken<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.390> x60<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> side<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.770> things<00:00:19.920> but

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a Kraken and x60 the side of things but

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.720 
a Kraken and x60 the side of things but
it's<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.580> only<00:00:20.850> Corsair<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.990> swiftech

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
it's really only Corsair and swiftech

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
it's really only Corsair and swiftech
these<00:00:23.730> are<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.150> major<00:00:24.390> companies<00:00:24.990> who

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
these are the two major companies who

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
these are the two major companies who
got<00:00:25.920> static<00:00:26.250> pressure<00:00:26.640> optimized<00:00:27.060> funds

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
got static pressure optimized funds

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.349 
got static pressure optimized funds
which<00:00:28.349> also<00:00:28.590> were<00:00:28.890> helpful<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.519> air<00:00:29.910> calling

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
which also were helpful for air calling

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
which also were helpful for air calling
but<00:00:31.230> they've<00:00:31.410> got<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.980> H<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.730> course<00:00:33.420> over

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
but they've got the H the course over

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
but they've got the H the course over
the<00:00:33.780> hydro<00:00:34.170> series<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.460> top<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> the

at 120 millimeter rad support it's an

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
all-in-one system which means as the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.710 
all-in-one system which means as the
pump<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.200> block<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> closed<00:01:12.420> loop

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pump on the block and it is closed loop

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
pump on the block and it is closed loop
which<00:01:13.020> means<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> care<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.680> cannot<00:01:13.979> add<00:01:14.130> any

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
which means you care you cannot add any

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
which means you care you cannot add any
other<00:01:14.610> bits<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.470> features<00:01:17.720> like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
other bits into it it also features like

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.490 
other bits into it it also features like
this<00:01:18.990> control<00:01:19.650> system<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.630> through<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.229> two

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
this control system so through the two

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
this control system so through the two
ports<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> top<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> block

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
ports that are on the top of the block

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
ports that are on the top of the block
it<00:01:24.810> controls<00:01:25.259> pump<00:01:25.560> speed<00:01:25.830> fan<00:01:26.340> speed

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it controls pump speed fan speed

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.899 
it controls pump speed fan speed
everything<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.689> along<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> system

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
everything to go along with the system

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
everything to go along with the system
so<00:01:30.079> these<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.470> ones<00:01:31.680> there's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> few

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so these all in ones there's a few

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
so these all in ones there's a few
advantages<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> Vantage<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
advantages to them then the Vantage is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.539 
advantages to them then the Vantage is
being<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.990> runs<00:01:36.990> cooler<00:01:37.320> than<00:01:37.619> most<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.460> the

being a runs cooler than most of the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
being a runs cooler than most of the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
systems and they're optimized for high
performance<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.619> ports<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> gives<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
performance the ports on them gives the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
performance the ports on them gives the

if<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.240> using<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:54.570> AMD<00:01:54.810> system<00:01:55.110> these

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
if you're using an AMD system these
