hey folks Matt for my really image calm
following<00:00:03.179> up<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.870> last<00:00:04.140> video<00:00:04.500> about<00:00:04.950> Tony

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
following up on my last video about Tony

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.040 
following up on my last video about Tony
Northrup's<00:00:06.140> ISO<00:00:07.370> and<00:00:08.420> crop<00:00:09.420> factor<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.990> how

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
Northrup's ISO and crop factor and how

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.970 
Northrup's ISO and crop factor and how
he<00:00:10.110> was<00:00:10.320> saying<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.800> play<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
he was saying you have to play a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.589 
he was saying you have to play a
multiplier<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.969> disagree<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
multiplier and how I disagree with that

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.629 
multiplier and how I disagree with that
I<00:00:12.750> your<00:00:13.170> exposure<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.710> your<00:00:13.980> exposure<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.429> was

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I your exposure is your exposure I was

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.480 
I your exposure is your exposure I was
saying<00:00:15.139> and<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.650> saying<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.070> video<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
saying and what I'm saying that video is

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
saying and what I'm saying that video is
if<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.760> exposures<00:00:18.150> f/8<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.960> 250th<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> a

second<00:00:20.010> iso<00:00:20.460> 200<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.810> for

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
second iso 200 that's what it is for

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
second iso 200 that's what it is for
full-frame<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.670> aps-c

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
full-frame that's what it is for aps-c

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 
full-frame that's what it is for aps-c
crop<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.710> Micro<00:00:26.099> Four

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
crop that's what it is for Micro Four

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.390 
crop that's what it is for Micro Four
Thirds<00:00:26.310> doesn't<00:00:27.150> change<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> Tony<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.189> saying

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
Thirds doesn't change so Tony was saying

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
Thirds doesn't change so Tony was saying
you<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> apply<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.029> crop<00:00:30.840> multipliers

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you have to apply these crop multipliers

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.880 
you have to apply these crop multipliers
like<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.130> would<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.410> equivalent<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
like you would to get equivalent of the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.080 
like you would to get equivalent of the
lens<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.530> 300<00:00:37.530> millimeter<00:00:37.980> lens<00:00:38.730> on

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
lens like that a 300 millimeter lens on

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.069 
lens like that a 300 millimeter lens on
full<00:00:39.390> frame<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.170> 450<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.640> roughly<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> 450

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
full frame is a 450 on a roughly a 450

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.200 
full frame is a 450 on a roughly a 450
field<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.620> view<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:46.039> aps-c<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.059> about

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
field of view on a aps-c and it's about

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
field of view on a aps-c and it's about
a<00:00:48.270> 600<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.680> micro<00:00:49.980> four-thirds<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
a 600 on a micro four-thirds that is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.819 
a 600 on a micro four-thirds that is
correct<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> lens<00:00:51.870> field<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.320> view<00:00:52.410> changes

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
correct your lens field of view changes

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.119 
correct your lens field of view changes
but<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.129> ISO<00:00:53.430> does<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> has

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
but your ISO does not and he kind of has

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.380 
but your ISO does not and he kind of has
the<00:00:56.280> same<00:00:58.609> let's<00:00:59.609> say<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:01:00.030> disagree

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the same let's say I'm gonna disagree

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.009 
the same let's say I'm gonna disagree
with<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> aperture<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> apertures<00:01:03.899> have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
with them on aperture and apertures have

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.160 
with them on aperture and apertures have
got<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.860> aspects<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.720> if<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.930> talking

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
got two aspects to it if you're talking

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
got two aspects to it if you're talking
about<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> exposure<00:01:07.979> again<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:09.150> aperture

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
does not change you do not apply a crop

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840 
does not change you do not apply a crop

across<00:01:50.970> clearly<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.710> depth<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
across clearly is that your depth of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
across clearly is that your depth of
field<00:01:53.280> changes<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.840> use<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
field changes you can use the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
field changes you can use the
calculations<00:01:56.219> he's<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> talking<00:01:56.850> about

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the crop factors if you want to know

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
the crop factors if you want to know
what<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> differences<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> depth<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> field

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
what the differences in depth of field

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.560 
what the differences in depth of field

in other words F let's go let's go to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.030 
in other words F let's go let's go to
the<00:02:03.719> shallow<00:02:04.020> depth<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> fields<00:02:04.799> where<00:02:04.890> you're

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the shallow depth of fields where you're

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440 
the shallow depth of fields where you're
really<00:02:05.219> gonna<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.240> where

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
really gonna see it and that's where

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
really gonna see it and that's where
people<00:02:06.659> talk<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.320> micro<00:02:07.649> four-thirds<00:02:08.099> not

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
people talk about micro four-thirds not

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
people talk about micro four-thirds not
liking<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.300> that

shallow depth of field and hence the the

to be the same as aps-c f-18 you would

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.800 
to be the same as aps-c f-18 you would

apply that 1.5 or 1.6 with canon

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.290 
apply that 1.5 or 1.6 with canon
multiplier<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.940> would<00:02:28.030> apply<00:02:28.120> two

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
multiplier and then you would apply two

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.330 
multiplier and then you would apply two
times<00:02:28.630> multiplier<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.590> micro<00:02:29.950> four-thirds

times multiplier with micro four-thirds

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.610 
times multiplier with micro four-thirds
to<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> same<00:02:31.240> depth<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.600> field<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.020> that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to get the same depth of field and that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.920 
to get the same depth of field and that
is<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.890> function<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.150> field<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.540> view<00:02:34.690> of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
is a function of the field of view of

is a function of the field of view of
the<00:02:35.350> lens<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.160> smaller<00:02:36.550> sensor

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
the lens and the smaller sensor

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.960 
the lens and the smaller sensor
definitely<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> factor<00:02:39.100> there<00:02:39.430> that's<00:02:39.640> depth

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
definitely a factor there that's depth

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.360 
definitely a factor there that's depth
of<00:02:40.180> field<00:02:40.480> which<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.900> not<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.380> same<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.890> your

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.510 
exposure your correct exposure would
remain<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> same<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:48.040> you're<00:02:48.220> looking<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
remain the same if you're looking to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.920 
remain the same if you're looking to
adjust<00:02:48.790> depth<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> field<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.480> could<00:02:49.660> use<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
adjust depth of field you could use the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.270 
adjust depth of field you could use the
multiplier<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:50.680> you're<00:02:50.800> gonna<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
multiplier but then you're gonna have to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.640 
multiplier but then you're gonna have to
adjust<00:02:51.400> your<00:02:52.210> shutter<00:02:52.480> speed<00:02:52.540> and/or<00:02:53.440> your

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
adjust your shutter speed and/or your

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.590 
adjust your shutter speed and/or your
eyes<00:02:53.770> so<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.670> get<00:02:54.790> your<00:02:54.940> exposure<00:02:55.240> back<00:02:55.450> to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
eyes so to get your exposure back to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480 
eyes so to get your exposure back to
where<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.810> needs<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.110> be<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
where it needs to be so you see it's a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.240 
where it needs to be so you see it's a
little<00:02:57.750> strange<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:59.410> not<00:02:59.440> be<00:02:59.770> pointing<00:03:00.130> out

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
little strange to not be pointing out

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.520 
little strange to not be pointing out
that<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:01.330> aperture<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.110> same<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
that the aperture is the same the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.170 
that the aperture is the same the
aperture<00:03:02.860> setting<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.790> want<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.090> adjust

the depth of field that the aperture
gives<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.300> apply<00:03:07.570> those<00:03:07.750> crop

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
gives you then you can apply those crop

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.440 
gives you then you can apply those crop
factors<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:09.070> do<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.190> guys<00:03:09.250> think<00:03:09.550> do<00:03:10.360> you

understand that did you know that Tony

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.610 
understand that did you know that Tony
was<00:03:12.250> kind<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.580> not<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.660> know<00:03:13.750> did<00:03:13.990> when<00:03:14.410> Tony

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
was kind of not you know did when Tony

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.110 
was kind of not you know did when Tony
says<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.100> did<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.370> know<00:03:15.520> he<00:03:15.670> was<00:03:15.790> just

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
says that did you know he was just

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240 
says that did you know he was just
talking<00:03:16.420> about<00:03:16.480> depth<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.959> field<00:03:17.170> or<00:03:17.350> what<00:03:18.160> he

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
talking about depth of field or what he

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.980 
talking about depth of field or what he
was<00:03:18.340> saying<00:03:18.640> only<00:03:18.880> applies<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.450> depth<00:03:19.840> of

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
was saying only applies to depth of

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.330 
was saying only applies to depth of
field<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> doesn't<00:03:20.890> apply<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
field because it doesn't apply to the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.120 
field because it doesn't apply to the
exposure<00:03:21.640> or<00:03:22.290> did<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.860> was

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
exposure or did you get what I was

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.290 
exposure or did you get what I was
thinking<00:03:24.430> where<00:03:24.520> he<00:03:24.580> kind<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.850> doesn't<00:03:25.150> make

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
thinking where he kind of doesn't make

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.610 
thinking where he kind of doesn't make
that<00:03:25.420> clear<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.930> what<00:03:26.020> he's<00:03:26.140> saying<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
that clear and what he's saying and I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.930 
that clear and what he's saying and I
think<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.160> some<00:03:27.370> people<00:03:27.400> maybe<00:03:27.730> get

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
think that some people maybe get

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.670 
think that some people maybe get
confused<00:03:28.420> from<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.750> let<00:03:29.260> me<00:03:29.290> know<00:03:29.440> leave<00:03:29.590> a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
confused from that let me know leave a

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.290 
confused from that let me know leave a
comment<00:03:29.860> below<00:03:30.070> we'd<00:03:30.610> have<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> discussion<00:03:31.090> on

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
comment below we'd have a discussion on

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.140 
comment below we'd have a discussion on
it<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:32.170> difference<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.490> know<00:03:33.580> aperture
