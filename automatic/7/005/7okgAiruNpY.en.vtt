hello to everyone watching I'm sorry

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.749 
hello to everyone watching I'm sorry
this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.870> not<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.170> best<00:00:04.319> microphone<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.279> have

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is not the best microphone I have

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is not the best microphone I have
some<00:00:06.000> new<00:00:06.150> stuff<00:00:06.359> coming<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.779> though<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.170> don't

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
some new stuff coming in though so don't

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.410 
some new stuff coming in though so don't
worry<00:00:07.529> about<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.880> just<00:00:09.120> wanted<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
worry about that but I just wanted to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.089 
worry about that but I just wanted to
make<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> quick<00:00:09.780> little<00:00:10.050> video<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.410> talking

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
make a quick little video here talking

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
make a quick little video here talking
about<00:00:11.719> guess<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.900> ta<00:00:14.630> so<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.660> play<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> lot<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
about guess what ta so I play a lot of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.019 
about guess what ta so I play a lot of
ta<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.859> pretty<00:00:17.400> much<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> biggest

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
ta I'm pretty much one of the biggest

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.560 
ta I'm pretty much one of the biggest
drive<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.660> find<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.730> I<00:00:20.730> see

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
drive so you can find for you and I see

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
drive so you can find for you and I see
a<00:00:21.600> lot<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.840> theory<00:00:22.320> crafting<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> people

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a lot of theory crafting and people

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
a lot of theory crafting and people
asking<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.539> mechanics<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.500> there

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
asking about how mechanics work on there

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
asking about how mechanics work on there
and<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.550> understandable<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and so on it's understandable if you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
and so on it's understandable if you
don't<00:00:27.449> play<00:00:27.599> tons<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.019> ta<00:00:28.260> games<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> one

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
don't play tons of ta games and one

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
don't play tons of ta games and one
thing<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> people<00:00:30.240> misunderstand<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
thing the people misunderstand about the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.080 
thing the people misunderstand about the
desolator<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.279> why<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.149> important<00:00:34.040> is

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
desolator and why it's so important is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.250 
desolator and why it's so important is
probably<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> reason<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.809> asked<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> go

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
probably the reason I get asked to go

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
probably the reason I get asked to go
either<00:00:37.469> build<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.160> often<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.059> don't

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
either build so often but people don't

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.410 
either build so often but people don't
understand<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:40.010> key<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.340> item<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.270> your

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
understand how key this item is to your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
understand how key this item is to your
success<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> make<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> quick

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
success so I just want to make a quick

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.569 
success so I just want to make a quick
video<00:00:45.180> talking<00:00:45.719> about<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.550> mechanic<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
video talking about a mechanic that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.389 
video talking about a mechanic that
people<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.440> people<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.250> think

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
people don't know or people don't think

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.299 
people don't know or people don't think
about<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> much<00:00:51.000> anyway<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.280> about

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
about that much anyway the thing about

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
about that much anyway the thing about
this<00:00:53.730> later<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> purchase<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this later is that when you purchase it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.330 
this later is that when you purchase it
you<00:00:57.660> increase<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.140> damage<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.219> by

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you increase your damage not just by

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.569 
you increase your damage not just by
right-click<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.510> by<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.109> melt<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
right-click but also by your melt so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.140 
right-click but also by your melt so
this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.030> very<00:01:03.300> key<00:01:03.600> feature<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.369> I'll<00:01:05.369> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this is a very key feature and I'll just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
this is a very key feature and I'll just
go<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> show<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.799> typical

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
go in game here to show you a typical

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
go in game here to show you a typical
item<00:01:08.610> progression<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.780> blink<00:01:10.080> dagger

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
item progression would be blink dagger

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.000 
item progression would be blink dagger
into<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.430> later<00:01:11.840> into<00:01:12.840> crit<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.350> course<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
into this later into crit of course you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
into this later into crit of course you
go<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.369> bottle<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.270> go<00:01:15.479> aqua<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
go for bottle could go aqua like you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.010 
go for bottle could go aqua like you
skip<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.850> could<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.479> course<00:01:18.810> face

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
skip it and could go of course face

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.340 
skip it and could go of course face
boots<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.380> threads<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> preference<00:01:20.460> thing

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
boots or threads it's a preference thing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
boots or threads it's a preference thing
but<00:01:22.350> again<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.250> back<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.240> works

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
but again going back to how it works

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.429 
but again going back to how it works
when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> hit<00:01:25.710> someone<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> order<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
when you hit someone the order of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.940 
when you hit someone the order of
interactions<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.670> ta<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.689> first<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.229> all-

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
interactions as ta is that first of all-

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.120 
interactions as ta is that first of all-
armor<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.579> applied<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.200> melds

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
armor is applied so if you have melds

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460 
armor is applied so if you have melds
going<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.420> minus<00:01:36.659> 8<00:01:36.869> armor<00:01:37.229> there

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
going off you have minus 8 armor there

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
going off you have minus 8 armor there
if<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.100> desolator<00:01:38.729> minus<00:01:39.329> 7<00:01:39.600> armor

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
if you have desolator minus 7 armor

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
if you have desolator minus 7 armor
there<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.799> these<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.189> items<00:01:41.340> together

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there so with these two items together

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.510 
there so with these two items together
you're<00:01:42.360> putting<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.869> opponent<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.530> minus<00:01:43.950> 15

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you're putting your opponent at minus 15

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.179 
you're putting your opponent at minus 15
of<00:01:44.729> their<00:01:44.909> current<00:01:45.119> armor<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.799> massive

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of their current armor that is massive

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
of their current armor that is massive
that's<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> first<00:01:48.060> thing<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> happens<00:01:48.960> when

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that's the first thing that happens when

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's the first thing that happens when
you<00:01:49.200> melt<00:01:49.350> strike<00:01:49.649> someone<00:01:49.920> after<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you melt strike someone after that you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
you melt strike someone after that you
have<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> meld<00:01:51.750> damage<00:01:52.229> being<00:01:52.470> taken<00:01:52.799> into

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
have to meld damage being taken into

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.550 
have to meld damage being taken into
account<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.939> separate<00:01:54.570> instance<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> damage

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
account as a separate instance of damage

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
account as a separate instance of damage

nonetheless<00:02:30.850> because<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.840> put<00:02:32.020> them<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.650> such

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
nonetheless because you put them at such

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
a good position when you deal tons of

a good position when you deal tons of
damage<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.370> enemy<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.780> that's<00:02:38.080> why<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
damage to enemy so that's why the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.400 
damage to enemy so that's why the
desolator<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.520> super<00:02:39.940> key<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.450> ta<00:02:40.480> not<00:02:41.140> just

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
desolator is super key for ta not just

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.960 
desolator is super key for ta not just
because<00:02:41.740> you're<00:02:41.920> right<00:02:42.190> click<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.610> increased

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
because you're right click is increased

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.460 
because you're right click is increased
yes<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.630> an<00:02:43.720> impressive<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.260> click

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
refraction damage but also because meld

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.420 
refraction damage but also because meld
is<00:02:48.210> just<00:02:49.210> as<00:02:49.360> well<00:02:49.570> increased<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.130> one<00:02:51.310> of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
is just as well increased it is one of

craft like I might try it out a little
bit<00:03:06.490> right<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.210> can<00:03:07.360> theory<00:03:07.690> craft<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.170> say

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
bit right you can theory craft and say

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.250 
bit right you can theory craft and say
though<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.680> should<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.100> really<00:03:09.370> good<00:03:09.580> but

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

always purchase it on ta almost

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.199 
always purchase it on ta almost
exclusively<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:18.340> just<00:03:18.700> very<00:03:18.880> hard<00:03:19.000> for

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
it's not really a type of fight that you

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.330 
it's not really a type of fight that you
can<00:04:42.960> take<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.290> ta<00:04:43.500> especially<00:04:44.070> when<00:04:44.220> the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
can take as ta especially when the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
we get a pretty good chance when they

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:08.120 
we get a pretty good chance when they
keep<00:04:54.360> chasing<00:04:54.750> on<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.410> score<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:07.229> must<00:05:07.770> I
