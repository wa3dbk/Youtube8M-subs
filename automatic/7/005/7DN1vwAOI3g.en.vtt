00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.080
Oh but you’re the insiders! 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.110
I'm a fan. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.890
I’ll let you in, but don’t tell anyone. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.070
Off you go, go, go!

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.060

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.900
The first part of the activity consists in managing and checking the components. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.160
This is done in an exceptionally clean and regulated area, over here.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.700

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.000
It’s in here that all this takes place. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.750
Here we are in the heart of the quality control department. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
All the control and quality activities are managed and coordinated from here. 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.820
In particular everything in relation to the inspection of components.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
Components, movements, dials, hands, cases, straps/bracelets

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.040
all these components are inspected, checked by the two controllers in here.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.570

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.290
Here, for example, we are inspecting dials.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.480
On the dials, as on all components, we carry out aesthetic checks

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.680
as well as technical controls with the equipment all around this room

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.940
At this workstation for instance, we're going to check a number of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.240
mechanical and dimensions characteristics so that we can ensure

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.880
that this movement can be used. 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.260
So we will be able to fit the dial in just the right conditions

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.220
and also to fix the hands in the right conditions.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.220
Here, for example, there’s a scratch on the 8, it will never cleared for use!

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.980
This is totally unacceptable. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.520
We have now seen all the technical side. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020
Now, there are all aesthetic checks.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.960
We will carry out these aesthetic controls by comparison with a specimen piece.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.850
We keep the specimen pieces here, and these are reference standards with which we

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.720
will compare all components that we receive.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.850
For instance, here are slightly earlier dials. 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.380
However, we obviously have the entire brand history.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.330
Everything is here, in particular the new products are also found here.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.400
We won’t look at the ones in here for too long as they are trade secrets.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.150
For leather straps too, we have various colors, particular shapes,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.020
textures and types of leather and we will always compare them

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.590
with these reference standards in here which we use to validate components that are delivered

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.750
So the components are checked here.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.980
Those that comply with our standards will be sent to the storeroom to be kept in stock.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.460
Let’s go!
