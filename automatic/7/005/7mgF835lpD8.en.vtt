00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.370 

the<00:00:21.070> bangs<00:00:21.310> on<00:00:21.519> the<00:00:21.550> TV<00:00:21.970> are<00:00:22.090> long<00:00:22.359> so<00:00:22.689> I<00:00:22.990> put

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the bangs on the TV are long so I put

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.230 
the bangs on the TV are long so I put
the<00:00:23.529> wig<00:00:23.680> on<00:00:23.830> my<00:00:24.009> own<00:00:24.220> head<00:00:24.580> marked<00:00:25.029> where<00:00:25.210> I

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
the wig on my own head marked where I

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.040 
the wig on my own head marked where I
wanted<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:25.869> bangs<00:00:26.109> to<00:00:26.320> be<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.740> then<00:00:27.279> cut<00:00:27.640> them

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
wanted the bangs to be and then cut them

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.560 
wanted the bangs to be and then cut them
next<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.349> want<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.860> curl<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:30.759> bangs<00:00:31.029> in

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
next you want to curl the bangs in

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.920 
next you want to curl the bangs in
layers<00:00:32.559> because<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.850> fibers<00:00:34.329> are<00:00:34.449> so<00:00:34.629> thick

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
layers because the fibers are so thick

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.619 
layers because the fibers are so thick
you're<00:00:35.140> going<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.379> have<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.800> separate<00:00:36.629> layers

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
you're going to have to separate layers

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.079 
you're going to have to separate layers
out<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.530> your<00:00:38.680> curling<00:00:39.010> iron<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.489> actually<00:00:39.879> do

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
out so your curling iron can actually do

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.600 
out so your curling iron can actually do
the<00:00:40.210> work<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.199> separated<00:00:41.890> mine<00:00:42.160> into<00:00:42.460> about

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the work so I separated mine into about

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.729 
the work so I separated mine into about
three<00:00:42.940> layers<00:00:43.210> curl<00:00:43.780> them<00:00:43.900> one<00:00:44.050> at<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.260> time<00:00:44.470> and

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
three layers curl them one at a time and

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.530 
three layers curl them one at a time and
then<00:00:44.860> kind<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.190> blended<00:00:45.579> them<00:00:45.699> in<00:00:45.879> later<00:00:46.150> by

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
then kind of blended them in later by

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.430 
then kind of blended them in later by
combing<00:00:47.199> it<00:00:47.320> out

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.279 

then<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> cut<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> pigtails<00:00:54.000> you'll<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
then to cut the pigtails you'll want to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.729 
then to cut the pigtails you'll want to
add<00:00:55.859> another<00:00:56.430> elastic<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:58.079> farther

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
add another elastic a little farther

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.910 
add another elastic a little farther
away<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.969> first<00:01:00.239> elastic<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:01.800> when

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
away from the first elastic so that when

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
away from the first elastic so that when
you<00:01:02.010> cut<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> pigtail<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you cut the pigtail off it's not a just

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
you cut the pigtail off it's not a just
a<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.350> mess<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> fibers<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> hold

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a big mess of fibers you want to hold

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
a big mess of fibers you want to hold
them<00:01:06.360> together<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:07.950> make<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
them together so that they don't make a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.940 
them together so that they don't make a
big<00:01:08.549> mess

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.920 

after<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> cut<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> pigtails<00:01:14.790> off<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.780> want

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
after you cut the pigtails off you want

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.800 
after you cut the pigtails off you want
to<00:01:16.020> clean<00:01:16.440> up<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.100> stubs<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.630> have

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to clean up the stubs that you have

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.030 
to clean up the stubs that you have
created

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.060 

next<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> create<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> firm<00:01:27.240> stub<00:01:28.070> most

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
next you want to create a firm stub most

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.330 
next you want to create a firm stub most
tutorials<00:01:29.700> suggest<00:01:30.119> using<00:01:30.299> caulking<00:01:31.340> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
tutorials suggest using caulking I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
tutorials suggest using caulking I
didn't<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.119> any<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.360> hand<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> used<00:01:34.110> hot

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
didn't have any on hand so I used hot

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.100 
didn't have any on hand so I used hot
glue<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.040> since<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.640> wig<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
glue and since this wig is

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
glue and since this wig is
heat-resistant

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
heat-resistant

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.920 
heat-resistant
that<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.799> worked<00:01:38.039> okay

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.200 

now<00:01:45.530> get<00:01:45.800> out<00:01:45.890> your<00:01:46.070> ponytail<00:01:46.640> clip<00:01:46.910> it's

now get out your ponytail clip it's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.300 
now get out your ponytail clip it's
basically<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.810> tiny<00:01:48.170> wig<00:01:48.560> wrapped<00:01:48.890> around<00:01:49.100> a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
basically a tiny wig wrapped around a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.570 
basically a tiny wig wrapped around a
hair<00:01:49.460> clip<00:01:49.610> take<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.690> hair<00:01:50.780> clip<00:01:51.020> out<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.710> you

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
hair clip take the hair clip out and you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.700 
hair clip take the hair clip out and you
will<00:01:52.700> see<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.910> piece<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.450> elastic<00:01:53.840> running

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
will see a piece of elastic running

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.530 
will see a piece of elastic running
around<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.040> edge<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.640> ponytail<00:01:55.940> base

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
around the edge of the ponytail base

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.790 
around the edge of the ponytail base
with<00:01:56.900> ends<00:01:57.320> tied<00:01:58.210> you'll<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.680> go<00:02:00.680> ahead

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
with ends tied you'll want to go ahead

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.220 
with ends tied you'll want to go ahead
and<00:02:01.130> cut<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.700> elastic<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.510> half<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
and cut this elastic in half and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.920 
and cut this elastic in half and
preserve<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.650> so<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.790> have<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.000> for<00:02:05.720> each

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
preserve it so that you have it for each

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.020 
preserve it so that you have it for each
pigtail<00:02:06.710> when<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.010> cut<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.490> whole<00:02:07.670> thing<00:02:07.910> in

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
pigtail when you cut the whole thing in

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
pigtail when you cut the whole thing in
half<00:02:08.530> next<00:02:09.530> look<00:02:09.710> at<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.009> way<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.340> wefts<00:02:10.670> are

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
half next look at the way the wefts are

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.040 
half next look at the way the wefts are
running<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.780> want<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.020> cut<00:02:12.370> halfway<00:02:13.370> between

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
running you want to cut halfway between

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
running you want to cut halfway between
the<00:02:15.050> weft<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.650> kind<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.980> count<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.430> wefts

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the weft so kind of count the wefts

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.090 
the weft so kind of count the wefts
divide<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.180> by<00:02:17.270> two<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:18.920> that's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
divide it by two and then see if that's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.490 
divide it by two and then see if that's
even<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.970> cut<00:02:20.510> between<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.930> weft<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.440> you

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
even and cut between the weft so you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.800 
even and cut between the weft so you
don't<00:02:21.860> actually<00:02:22.130> cut<00:02:22.610> into<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> hair<00:02:23.180> fibers

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
don't actually cut into the hair fibers

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.980 
don't actually cut into the hair fibers
then<00:02:24.800> you'll<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.160> two<00:02:25.640> pigtails<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.870> are

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
then you'll have two pigtails that are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.949 
then you'll have two pigtails that are
nice<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.530> thick<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:28.280> long<00:02:28.900> now<00:02:29.900> you

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
nice and thick and really long now you

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.800 
nice and thick and really long now you
can<00:02:30.500> use<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.890> elastic<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.209> have<00:02:32.420> on

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
can use the elastic that you have on

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.340 
can use the elastic that you have on
each<00:02:33.160> ponytail<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:35.060> tie<00:02:35.510> around<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:36.020> stubs

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350

on the base wig you have lots of elastic

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.199 
on the base wig you have lots of elastic
so<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.930> can<00:02:39.080> wrap<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.470> around<00:02:39.709> as<00:02:40.700> many<00:02:40.940> times

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
so you can wrap it around as many times

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.620 
so you can wrap it around as many times
as<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.540> will<00:02:41.660> go

the hair buds each have two small combs
inside<00:02:53.330> them<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.780> remove<00:02:54.290> them<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.770> seam

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
inside them I remove them with a seam

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.009

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
the buns are kind of big so what I did

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.410 
the buns are kind of big so what I did
was<00:03:00.829> kind<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:01.980> tuck<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.269> hair<00:03:03.750> fibers<00:03:04.230> under

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
was kind of tuck the hair fibers under

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.530 
was kind of tuck the hair fibers under
inside<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.750> hair<00:03:06.959> bun<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:08.250> kept<00:03:08.849> twisting

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
inside the hair bun and I kept twisting

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.929 
inside the hair bun and I kept twisting
and<00:03:09.900> scrunching<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.129> just<00:03:11.340> pulling<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
and scrunching and just pulling it

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.360 
and scrunching and just pulling it
together<00:03:12.299> so<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.750> made<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.170> more<00:03:13.500> compact<00:03:13.980> hair

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
together so it made a more compact hair

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.680

bun

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.940 

lastly<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.720> pinned<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.200> into<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> wig<00:03:19.770> with

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
lastly I pinned it into the wig with

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.309 
lastly I pinned it into the wig with
bobby<00:03:20.220> pins<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> temporary<00:03:21.810> solution

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
bobby pins this is a temporary solution

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.600 
bobby pins this is a temporary solution
and<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.880> might<00:03:24.720> not<00:03:24.930> last<00:03:25.170> very<00:03:25.260> long

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
and that might not last very long

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.979 
and that might not last very long
because<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> bobby<00:03:26.940> pins<00:03:27.209> tend<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.599> be<00:03:27.720> pushed

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
because the bobby pins tend to be pushed

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.470 
because the bobby pins tend to be pushed
out<00:03:28.200> by<00:03:28.410> your<00:03:28.590> head<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.300> suggest
