we<00:00:24.179> decided<00:00:24.599> to<00:00:24.689> trim<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> patio<00:00:25.529> pond<00:00:25.859> with

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
we decided to trim the patio pond with

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.609 
we decided to trim the patio pond with
wood<00:00:26.570> now<00:00:27.570> typically<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.289> outdoor

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
wood now typically in an outdoor

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
wood now typically in an outdoor
environment<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.669> choose<00:00:29.939> redwood

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
environment I'm going to choose redwood

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.750 
environment I'm going to choose redwood
come<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> find<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:31.830> client<00:00:32.280> doesn't<00:00:32.550> like

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
come to find out my client doesn't like

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.150 
come to find out my client doesn't like
redwood<00:00:33.030> he<00:00:33.330> wanted<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> light<00:00:34.020> color<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.650> we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
redwood he wanted a light color so we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160 
redwood he wanted a light color so we
chose<00:00:35.370> pine<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.090> easy<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:36.690> by<00:00:36.720> it's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
chose pine it's easy to come by it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.070 
chose pine it's easy to come by it's
affordable<00:00:37.740> the<00:00:38.580> trick<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.570> sensitive

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
affordable the trick is it's sensitive

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.930 
affordable the trick is it's sensitive
to<00:00:40.140> elements<00:00:40.740> it<00:00:40.860> doesn't<00:00:41.130> want<00:00:41.250> water<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to elements it doesn't want water on it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.640 
to elements it doesn't want water on it
so<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> course<00:00:42.750> we're<00:00:42.990> going<00:00:43.080> to<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.470> put

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
so of course we're going to have to put

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.250 
so of course we're going to have to put
some<00:00:43.830> sealant<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.810> thinking

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
some sealant on here but got me thinking

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.320 
some sealant on here but got me thinking
of<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.830> cool<00:00:47.010> element<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.640> could<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.970> is<00:00:48.120> we

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
of a cool element that we could do is we

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.210 
of a cool element that we could do is we
could<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.740> where<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.040> you<00:00:50.100> come

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
could make it to where when you come

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.040 
could make it to where when you come
around<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.460> corner

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
around the corner

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.150 
around the corner
this<00:00:52.050> patio<00:00:52.470> pond<00:00:52.740> is<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.040> look

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this patio pond is going to look

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.800 
this patio pond is going to look
elevated<00:00:53.700> I<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> elevate<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.480> off<00:00:54.660> the

look like the whole thing's floating I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
look like the whole thing's floating I
got<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.310> couple<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.760> cuts<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.630> then

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
got a couple more cuts to make and then

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
got a couple more cuts to make and then
we're<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.170> start<00:01:04.350> screwing<00:01:04.649> it<00:01:04.829> all

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we're gonna start screwing it all

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.380 
we're gonna start screwing it all
together<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.519> we'll<00:01:05.670> show<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
together and we'll show you how to do it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.160 
together and we'll show you how to do it
I<00:01:11.630> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> give<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.899> quick<00:01:13.140> explanation

I want to give you a quick explanation

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
I want to give you a quick explanation
about<00:01:14.009> how<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> frame<00:01:14.579> is<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> wrap

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
about how the frame is going to wrap

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
about how the frame is going to wrap
around<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.570> patio<00:01:15.960> pond<00:01:16.289> there's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> couple

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
around the patio pond there's a couple

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
around the patio pond there's a couple
different<00:01:17.280> ways<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.109> there's<00:01:19.109> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
different ways you can do it there's a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.739 
different ways you can do it there's a
log-cabin<00:01:19.710> approach<00:01:20.340> where<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:21.509> two

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
log-cabin approach where these two

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.510 
log-cabin approach where these two
pieces<00:01:21.929> come<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.499> that<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.399> I'm

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
pieces come like that you see how I'm

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.330 
pieces come like that you see how I'm
joining<00:01:23.909> these<00:01:23.969> together<00:01:24.179> here<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.979> then<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
joining these together here and then the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
joining these together here and then the
next<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.329> come<00:01:27.539> inside<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.479> would

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
next one would come inside so you would

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
next one would come inside so you would
see<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> joint<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.859> and<00:01:32.069> not<00:01:32.249> see<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> joint

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
see a joint here and not see a joint

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
see a joint here and not see a joint
here<00:01:33.359> and<00:01:33.539> then<00:01:34.109> the<00:01:34.200> same<00:01:34.409> thing<00:01:34.439> would

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
here and then the same thing would

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.760 
here and then the same thing would
happen<00:01:34.859> across<00:01:35.249> the<00:01:35.429> back<00:01:35.609> well<00:01:36.679> since<00:01:37.679> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
happen across the back well since that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.050 
happen across the back well since that
side<00:01:38.249> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> feature<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.819> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.999> be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
side of the feature is going to be

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
side of the feature is going to be
covered<00:01:39.359> with<00:01:39.539> plants<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
covered with plants and this side is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.899 
covered with plants and this side is
going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.859> be<00:01:40.950> covered<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.310> plants

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
going to be covered with plants

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
going to be covered with plants
I<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> whole<00:01:42.569> face<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> feature<00:01:43.710> not

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I want the whole face of the feature not

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.139 
I want the whole face of the feature not
to<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.609> any<00:01:44.819> seams<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> I've<00:01:47.340> taken<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.119> time

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to have any seams so I've taken the time

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.629 
to have any seams so I've taken the time
to<00:01:48.719> measure<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.499> across<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.069> this

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:50.639 
to measure all the way across and this

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.550 
to measure all the way across and this
is<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.450> continuous<00:01:51.990> piece<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is going to be one continuous piece and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
is going to be one continuous piece and
the<00:01:52.950> seams<00:01:53.189> are<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> come<00:01:53.729> from<00:01:53.999> behind

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the seams are going to come from behind

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840 
the seams are going to come from behind
this<00:01:54.719> section<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.069> that's<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.579> I've<00:01:56.670> done

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this section so that's what I've done

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
this section so that's what I've done
when<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.179> cut<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> pieces<00:01:58.079> around<00:01:58.319> there

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
when I cut all the pieces around there

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
when I cut all the pieces around there
now<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> explained<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.209> want<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.389> see<00:02:00.509> any

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
now I explained I don't want to see any

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.449 
now I explained I don't want to see any
hardware<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.799> walk<00:02:01.979> around<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> corner

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
hardware when you walk around the corner

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.520 
hardware when you walk around the corner
and<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.030> feature<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.139> hardware<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and see this feature all the hardware is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.020 
and see this feature all the hardware is
going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.709> be<00:02:04.799> done<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.130> behind<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> made

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
going to be done from behind so I made

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
going to be done from behind so I made
these<00:02:06.149> cleats<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.959> these<00:02:07.619> cleats<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.160> what

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
these cleats and these cleats are what

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
these cleats and these cleats are what
we're<00:02:08.460> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.880> I'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.600> screw

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we're going to use I'm going to screw

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
we're going to use I'm going to screw
through<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.350> of<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:11.070> wood<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.630> we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
through the back of this wood so when we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.070 
through the back of this wood so when we
stay

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
stay

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
stay
in<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.260> you're<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.770> gonna<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.250> how<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> thing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
in it you're not gonna see how the thing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.890 
in it you're not gonna see how the thing
was<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.910> together<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.240> got<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> couple<00:02:15.690> more

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
was put together I got a couple more

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.250 
was put together I got a couple more
cleats<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.380> make<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.770> do<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.490> show<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
cleats to make I do want to show you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
cleats to make I do want to show you
since<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.380> dealing<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:20.100> little<00:02:20.910> bit<00:02:21.000> more

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
since I'm dealing with a little bit more

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.590 
since I'm dealing with a little bit more
sensitive<00:02:21.660> wood<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.850> little<00:02:24.300> pilot

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
sensitive wood I have a little pilot

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.320 
sensitive wood I have a little pilot
hole<00:02:28.040> well<00:02:29.040> drill<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> little<00:02:29.520> pilot<00:02:29.760> hole<00:02:29.940> like

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
hole well drill a little pilot hole like

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.260 
hole well drill a little pilot hole like
so<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.070> little<00:02:35.250> impact<00:02:35.790> gun

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
so and then I have my little impact gun

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.950 
so and then I have my little impact gun
here<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:41.010> by<00:02:41.160> doing<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.360> pilot<00:02:42.630> hole

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
here so by doing the the pilot hole

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.020 
here so by doing the the pilot hole
first<00:02:44.150> it's<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.330> make<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:47.030> really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
first it's going to make for a really

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.350 
first it's going to make for a really
clean<00:02:48.330> connection<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.140> it'll<00:02:50.180> won't<00:02:51.180> make

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
clean connection and it'll won't make

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.290 
clean connection and it'll won't make
this<00:02:51.540> crack<00:02:51.959> as<00:02:52.170> easily<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.000> you're<00:02:54.090> using

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
this crack as easily so if you're using

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210 
this crack as easily so if you're using
a<00:02:54.480> treated<00:02:54.870> wood<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.290> lot<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.650> times<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.070> it's

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
a treated wood a lot of times if it's

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220 
a treated wood a lot of times if it's
kiln<00:02:56.459> dried<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.570> go<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> put<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.080> together

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
kiln dried you go to put it together

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680 
kiln dried you go to put it together
like<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.590> it'll<00:02:59.459> crack<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
like that it'll crack but if you put a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.670 
like that it'll crack but if you put a
pilot<00:03:01.020> hole<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.230> there<00:03:01.350> first<00:03:03.530> will<00:03:04.530> come

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
pilot hole in there first will come

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
pilot hole in there first will come
together<00:03:04.830> nice<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.130> clean<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.300> now

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
together nice and clean like that so now

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.300 
together nice and clean like that so now
all<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> cleats<00:03:06.900> are<00:03:07.080> put<00:03:07.230> together<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:08.160> can

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
all the cleats are put together we can

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
all the cleats are put together we can
start<00:03:08.520> putting<00:03:08.730> together<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.330> big<00:03:09.480> frame<00:03:12.230> so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
start putting together the big frame so

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.790 
start putting together the big frame so
I'm<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.440> flush<00:03:13.709> these<00:03:13.920> ends<00:03:14.280> up<00:03:15.740> now<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
I'm going to flush these ends up now the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.490 
I'm going to flush these ends up now the
Laguna<00:03:17.610> prefabricated<00:03:18.390> ponds<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.019> chose

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
Laguna prefabricated ponds that I chose

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.820 
Laguna prefabricated ponds that I chose
that<00:03:20.010> are<00:03:20.100> exactly<00:03:20.489> 18<00:03:20.970> inches<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:22.260> used

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
that are exactly 18 inches so we used

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.360 
that are exactly 18 inches so we used
one<00:03:23.730> by<00:03:23.940> tens<00:03:24.420> gives<00:03:24.930> us<00:03:25.140> two<00:03:25.860> nine<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> half

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
one by tens gives us two nine and a half

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090 
one by tens gives us two nine and a half
inch<00:03:26.670> pieces<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.110> gives<00:03:28.440> us<00:03:28.530> 18<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> half

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
inch pieces or so gives us 18 and a half

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.490 
inch pieces or so gives us 18 and a half
so<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.459> about<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.670> half<00:03:29.760> inch<00:03:30.060> play<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> I

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so I have about a half inch play so I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500 
so I have about a half inch play so I
have<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.920> thing<00:03:31.980> lined<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.610> nice<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:32.850> even

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
have this thing lined up nice and even

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.750 
have this thing lined up nice and even
now<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.530> time<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.709> me<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.950> drop<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.400> cleat

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
now it's time for me to drop this cleat

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750 
now it's time for me to drop this cleat
on<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.500> then<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.860> can<00:03:38.280> drill<00:03:38.580> this

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
on here and then I can drill this

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.520 
on here and then I can drill this
together<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:42.510> I'm<00:03:42.630> going<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.840> pilot<00:03:43.320> this

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
together now I'm going to pilot this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.090 
together now I'm going to pilot this
this<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.550> back<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.860> feature

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
this is the back of the of the feature

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.229 
this is the back of the of the feature
the<00:03:47.459> inside<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:49.070> just<00:03:50.070> barely<00:03:50.340> want<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> pilot

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
the inside I just barely want to pilot

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.590 
the inside I just barely want to pilot
that<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:52.340> don't<00:03:53.340> want<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.519> go<00:03:53.640> too<00:03:54.060> far<00:03:54.300> in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that I don't want to go too far in

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.710 
that I don't want to go too far in
because<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:56.160> don't<00:03:56.910> want<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.209> see<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.450> screws

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
because I don't want to see the screws

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.710 
because I don't want to see the screws
protruding<00:03:58.320> through

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
protruding through

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.810 
protruding through
so<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.990> barely<00:04:01.440> get<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> pilot<00:04:02.670> going<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.760> I

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
so just barely get a pilot going and I

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.430 
so just barely get a pilot going and I
don't<00:04:05.880> want<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> bury<00:04:06.300> these<00:04:06.540> two<00:04:06.840> deep<00:04:07.140> either

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
don't want to bury these two deep either

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.290 
don't want to bury these two deep either
because<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.920> don't<00:04:07.950> want<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:10.850> want<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.120> pop

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
because I don't want that I want to pop

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:36.950 
because I don't want that I want to pop
through<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.630> other<00:04:12.780> side<00:04:35.660> okay<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:36.720> this

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
through the other side okay so this

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.790 
through the other side okay so this
piece<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> complete<00:04:38.390> as<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.450> turn<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:39.960> around

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.930 

you'll<00:04:43.800> notice<00:04:43.860> we<00:04:44.220> won't<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:44.580> any<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.880> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
you'll notice we won't see any of the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:57.140 
you'll notice we won't see any of the
hardware<00:04:46.010> sticking<00:04:47.010> through<00:04:50.510> clean<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:57.000> now

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
hardware sticking through clean so now

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.240 
hardware sticking through clean so now
it's<00:04:57.360> time<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.630> extended<00:04:58.530> long<00:04:58.740> boards<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
it's time to extended long boards and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.170 
it's time to extended long boards and
connect<00:04:59.760> them<00:04:59.850> all<00:04:59.970> together<00:05:01.850> we<00:05:02.850> have<00:05:02.940> most

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
connect them all together we have most

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.060 
connect them all together we have most
of<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.360> frame<00:05:03.540> put<00:05:03.780> together<00:05:03.870> by<00:05:04.170> now<00:05:04.380> but

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
of the frame put together by now but

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.260 
of the frame put together by now but
we're<00:05:05.160> going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.310> work<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.730> face<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
we're going to work on the face of the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.630 
we're going to work on the face of the
whole<00:05:06.300> feature<00:05:06.750> at<00:05:07.200> this<00:05:07.410> point<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:08.310> I've

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
whole feature at this point so I've

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.670 
whole feature at this point so I've
taken<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.060> liberty<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.450> pick<00:05:10.230> out<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> most

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
taken the liberty to pick out the most

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.940 
taken the liberty to pick out the most
interesting<00:05:10.950> pieces<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.850> wood<00:05:12.090> with<00:05:12.950> unique

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
interesting pieces of wood with unique

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.700 
interesting pieces of wood with unique
knots<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.850> them<00:05:15.150> because<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.320> varnish<00:05:16.620> is

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
knots in them because the varnish is

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.870 
knots in them because the varnish is
going<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.920> be<00:05:17.010> clear<00:05:17.310> it's<00:05:17.550> going<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
going to be clear it's going to be a

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.910 
going to be clear it's going to be a
medium<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.570> light<00:05:18.750> stain<00:05:19.140> so<00:05:19.680> you're<00:05:19.770> going<00:05:19.890> to

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
medium to light stain so you're going to

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.350 
medium to light stain so you're going to
see<00:05:20.070> right<00:05:20.250> through<00:05:20.310> this<00:05:20.670> and<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:20.970> figured

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
see right through this and I figured

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360 
see right through this and I figured
we'd<00:05:21.930> pick<00:05:22.080> out<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.320> interesting<00:05:22.530> stuff<00:05:22.920> so

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
we'd pick out the interesting stuff so

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.890 
we'd pick out the interesting stuff so
when<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.550> come<00:05:23.700> around<00:05:23.820> it'll<00:05:24.240> give<00:05:24.660> it<00:05:24.690> some

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
when you come around it'll give it some

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.050 
when you come around it'll give it some
character<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.890> this<00:05:26.130> is<00:05:26.280> where<00:05:26.490> we're<00:05:26.670> going

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
character so this is where we're going

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:53.990 
character so this is where we're going
to<00:05:27.150> put<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.420> one<00:05:27.630> together<00:05:27.750> right<00:05:27.930> now<00:05:53.000> all

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
to put this one together right now all

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.430 
to put this one together right now all
right<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.450> about<00:05:54.600> have<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:54.960> wrapped<00:05:55.230> up

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
right I just about have this wrapped up

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.560 
right I just about have this wrapped up
I<00:05:55.680> do<00:05:55.980> have<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.310> couple<00:05:56.580> more<00:05:56.730> boards<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.210> put<00:05:57.390> on
