hey<00:00:00.539> everyone<00:00:00.989> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.620> I'll<00:00:01.860> be

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey everyone in this video I'll be

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey everyone in this video I'll be
explaining<00:00:02.370> flat<00:00:02.790> wheels<00:00:03.000> now<00:00:03.600> fly<00:00:03.870> wheels

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
explaining flat wheels now fly wheels

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.170 
explaining flat wheels now fly wheels
are<00:00:04.380> energy<00:00:04.740> storage<00:00:05.130> units<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.850> used<00:00:06.089> to

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
are energy storage units and I used to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.730 
are energy storage units and I used to
keep<00:00:06.330> an<00:00:06.509> engine<00:00:06.779> running<00:00:06.899> smooth<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
keep an engine running smooth and to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530 
keep an engine running smooth and to
keep<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.040> running<00:00:08.189> when<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:09.120> not<00:00:09.269> giving

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
keep it running when you're not giving

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560 
keep it running when you're not giving
gas<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> neutral<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.880> good

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
gas or it's in neutral now a good

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
gas or it's in neutral now a good
analogy<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.469> potter's<00:00:13.889> wheel<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.880> you

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
analogy is a potter's wheel so if you

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.070 
analogy is a potter's wheel so if you
think<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> potter's<00:00:15.630> wheel<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
think about a potter's wheel to have a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.960 
think about a potter's wheel to have a
little<00:00:16.350> foot<00:00:16.650> press<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.190> keep<00:00:17.369> pressing<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
little foot press they keep pressing and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
little foot press they keep pressing and
it<00:00:18.330> spins<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.750> large<00:00:18.930> stone<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> bottom<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it spins a large stone on the bottom and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
it spins a large stone on the bottom and
that's<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.550> stones<00:00:20.910> rotating<00:00:21.480> it's

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
that's that stones rotating it's

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
that's that stones rotating it's
connected<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> table<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.250> hold

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
connected to a table in which they hold

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
connected to a table in which they hold
the<00:00:23.550> clay<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.150> shape<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> mold<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the clay and they can shape and mold it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
the clay and they can shape and mold it
and<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.529> clay<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> spinning<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> constant

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and that clay is spinning at a constant

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.670 
and that clay is spinning at a constant
speed<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.630> that's<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> flywheel

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
speed and that's because of the flywheel

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
speed and that's because of the flywheel
down<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> bottom<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.849> has<00:00:30.029> its<00:00:30.210> inertia

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
down at the bottom that has its inertia

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.569 
down at the bottom that has its inertia
and<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> stays<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> constant<00:00:31.980> speed<00:00:32.130> even

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and so it stays at a constant speed even

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
and so it stays at a constant speed even
though<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.850> force<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> apply<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.930> at

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
though the force that you apply is at

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.030 
though the force that you apply is at
intervals<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> same<00:00:36.840> idea<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.620> be

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
intervals so the same idea can be

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
intervals so the same idea can be
applied<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.309> cars<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> cars<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.469> fly<00:00:40.680> wheels

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
applied to cars so cars have fly wheels

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
applied to cars so cars have fly wheels
attached<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> end<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> engine<00:00:42.300> or

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
attached at the end of the engine or

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.110 
attached at the end of the engine or
attached<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> crankshaft<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
attached to the crankshaft and it's the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.569 
attached to the crankshaft and it's the
item<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.170> pressed<00:00:46.890> against<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
item that will be pressed against with

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
item that will be pressed against with
the<00:00:47.760> transmission<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.539> you'll<00:00:48.660> either<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the transmission so you'll either have a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
the transmission so you'll either have a
clutch<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.610> turkin<00:00:51.180> torque<00:00:51.539> converter<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
clutch or a turkin torque converter and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
clutch or a turkin torque converter and
the<00:00:52.559> torque<00:00:52.770> converter<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.399> mounted

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the torque converter would be mounted

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
the torque converter would be mounted
attached<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> flywheel<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> clutch

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
attached to the flywheel and the clutch

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.369 
attached to the flywheel and the clutch
would<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> clutch<00:00:57.030> plate<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.109> press

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
would the clutch plate would press

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
would the clutch plate would press
against<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.789> were<00:00:59.910> trying<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
against it when you were trying to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
against it when you were trying to
accelerate<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.289> you're<00:01:01.440> engaging<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
accelerate or when you're engaging the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.679 
accelerate or when you're engaging the
clutch<00:01:02.250> rather<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> basic<00:01:05.580> idea<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.060> if

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
clutch rather so the basic idea is if

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
clutch rather so the basic idea is if
you<00:01:07.080> didn't<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.799> flywheel<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you didn't have that flywheel on there

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
you didn't have that flywheel on there
you'd<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.750> uneven<00:01:10.320> power

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you'd have really uneven power

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890 
you'd have really uneven power
distribution<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> went<00:01:12.210> through<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
distribution so I went through here and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
distribution so I went through here and
we've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> four<00:01:13.500> strokes<00:01:13.920> divided<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.610> in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we've got the four strokes divided up in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.719 
we've got the four strokes divided up in
take<00:01:15.330> compression<00:01:16.080> power<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.590> exhaust<00:01:16.830> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
take compression power and exhaust so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
take compression power and exhaust so
you've<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:17.970> intake<00:01:18.330> occurring<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> first

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you've got intake occurring the first

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
you've got intake occurring the first
stage<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:20.369> compression<00:01:20.939> occurring<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
stage your compression occurring the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
stage your compression occurring the
second<00:01:21.720> stage<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.740> power

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
second stage and then you got your power

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
second stage and then you got your power
stroke<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.600> engine's<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.140> producing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
stroke so your engine's not producing

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.070 
stroke so your engine's not producing
any<00:01:25.950> torque<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> power

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
any torque when you're not in that power

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
any torque when you're not in that power
stroke<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.009> once<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
stroke and then once you get to it you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.550 
stroke and then once you get to it you
have<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> peak<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.570> power<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.259> you'd<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have a peak of power so you'd have a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
have a peak of power so you'd have a
jerk<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> were<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> vehicle<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
jerk if you were in the vehicle now this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
jerk if you were in the vehicle now this
is<00:01:34.200> eliminated<00:01:34.860> by<00:01:35.369> adding<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.060> flywheel<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is eliminated by adding this flywheel so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.090 
is eliminated by adding this flywheel so
your<00:01:37.170> torque<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> very<00:01:38.040> even<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:40.100> even

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
your torque is very even and so even

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
your torque is very even and so even
when<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.549> applying<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.119> power

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
when you're not applying that power

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.590 
when you're not applying that power
stroke<00:01:42.869> you'll<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.520> power<00:01:45.299> distribution

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
stroke you'll have a power distribution

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
stroke you'll have a power distribution
because<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> inertia<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> flywheel

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because of the inertia of the flywheel

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
because of the inertia of the flywheel
maintains<00:01:47.939> power<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.790> basically<00:01:50.790> however<00:01:51.720> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
maintains power so basically however if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
maintains power so basically however if
you<00:01:52.829> increase<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> size<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> flywheel

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you increase the size of the flywheel

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
you increase the size of the flywheel
then<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.619> increase<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.369> smoothness<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
then you can increase the smoothness and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539 
then you can increase the smoothness and
basically<00:01:57.570> level<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.369> see

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
basically level this out so you can see

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.709 
basically level this out so you can see
there's<00:01:59.729> still<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.090> bump<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> could

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
there's still a little bump you could

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
there's still a little bump you could
get<00:02:00.899> rid<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.350> completely<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.189> just

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
get rid of that completely if you just

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
get rid of that completely if you just
had<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> big<00:02:02.820> enough<00:02:03.030> flywheel<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.140> why<00:02:04.290> would

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
had a big enough flywheel so why would

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.709 
had a big enough flywheel so why would
you<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.280> huge<00:02:05.460> flywheel<00:02:06.030> since

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you have a really huge flywheel since

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
you have a really huge flywheel since
you'll<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> smoother<00:02:07.680> running

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you'll have a smoother running

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910 
you'll have a smoother running
and<00:02:08.399> an<00:02:08.880> even<00:02:09.240> power<00:02:09.479> delivery<00:02:09.840> engine<00:02:10.319> well

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and an even power delivery engine well

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
and an even power delivery engine well
there's<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:12.180> problems<00:02:12.690> really

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
there's two problems really

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
there's two problems really
you've<00:02:13.200> got<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.560> rotational<00:02:14.220> inertia<00:02:14.310> if

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you've got more rotational inertia if

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.340 
you've got more rotational inertia if
you<00:02:14.819> have<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> larger<00:02:15.300> flywheel<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you have a larger flywheel and that

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.809 
you have a larger flywheel and that
means<00:02:16.560> you've<00:02:16.860> got<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.069> spin<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.550> flywheel

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
means you've got to spin that flywheel

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.460 
means you've got to spin that flywheel
up<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.810> takes<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> lot<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.290> energy

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
up and to do that takes a lot of energy

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
up and to do that takes a lot of energy
so<00:02:20.100> that's<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.430> wasting<00:02:20.910> fuel<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:21.420> just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
so that's just wasting fuel you're just

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.820 
so that's just wasting fuel you're just
trying<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.990> flywheel<00:02:22.319> spinning<00:02:22.560> that's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
trying to get a flywheel spinning that's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.979 
trying to get a flywheel spinning that's
not<00:02:22.980> getting<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.490> move<00:02:23.640> anywhere<00:02:24.000> second

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
not getting you to move anywhere second

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.750 
not getting you to move anywhere second
added<00:02:25.380> weight<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.100> want<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> keep<00:02:26.459> everything

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
added weight you want to keep everything

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.250 
added weight you want to keep everything
in<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.090> car<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.360> light<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.630> possible<00:02:27.690> just

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
in your car as light as possible just

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.080 
in your car as light as possible just
for<00:02:28.290> handling<00:02:28.620> purposes<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.730> pretty<00:02:29.940> much

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
for handling purposes for pretty much

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.479 
for handling purposes for pretty much
all<00:02:30.270> purposes<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.500> performance<00:02:32.069> aspect

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
all purposes of the performance aspect

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.130 
all purposes of the performance aspect
of<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> vehicle<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.600> want<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> keep<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
of a vehicle so you want to keep the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.650 
of a vehicle so you want to keep the
flywheel<00:02:34.560> weight<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.160> low<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.790> possible<00:02:36.270> but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
flywheel weight as low as possible but

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.750 
flywheel weight as low as possible but
still<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.319> even<00:02:37.830> torque<00:02:38.160> delivery<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
still have even torque delivery and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.979 
still have even torque delivery and
that's<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.300> purpose<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:41.810> now<00:02:42.810> it's

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that's the purpose of it now it's

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.449 
that's the purpose of it now it's
difficult<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.530> show<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.769> my<00:02:44.010> flywheel

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
difficult to show you my flywheel

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.699 
difficult to show you my flywheel
because<00:02:44.850> its<00:02:45.030> internal<00:02:45.600> but<00:02:45.840> here's<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
because its internal but here's the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.590 
because its internal but here's the
basic<00:02:47.010> idea<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.489> you've<00:02:47.610> got<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> engine<00:02:48.269> here

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
basic idea if you've got the engine here

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
basic idea if you've got the engine here
so<00:02:49.380> you've<00:02:49.500> got<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.769> cylinders<00:02:50.190> line<00:02:50.370> across

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
so you've got the cylinders line across

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.570 
so you've got the cylinders line across
there<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:51.989> inside<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.709> case<00:02:53.010> where

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
there and then inside of this case where

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.309 
there and then inside of this case where
there's<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.850> clutch<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.750> flywheel<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.200> going

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
there's a clutch the flywheel is going

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.710 
there's a clutch the flywheel is going
to<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.440> spinning<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.030> that's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
to be spinning in here and that's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.570 
to be spinning in here and that's
actually<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.290> starter<00:02:58.800> motor<00:02:59.010> will<00:02:59.220> attach

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
actually what starter motor will attach

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.170 
actually what starter motor will attach
to<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.420> start<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.810> engine
