00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 we have clicked on New Year's Eve and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.260
 once in the pan kloppen petronas 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 was then I found a recipe 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:45.110
 that was and it was so super simple 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:50.039
 Just send an email this time 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.879
 be water and it was so delicious 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.010
 that we absolutely have this pizza dough 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.590
 quasi like to do it again 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.260
 normal pizza and I do that today 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 because yes that was totally delicious and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.140
 we also found this pizza man 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 I have received a raclette given 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 because I cook it and I believe the same 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.200
 the second recipe was somehow and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 then you just stop the pond and then 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.000
 is formed to believe shaped bit 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.060
 that you then stop in the pan 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.020
 can push in and then prove halt 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.700
 I also have super delicious ones 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.990
 fresh cheese cream found there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 that was really really cool with 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 so I will be for example with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 Cooked potatoes then decide 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.479
 to get a little salt 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.460
 this cream over it and then stop 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.630
 in the moped bahrain as a person yummy so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 you have to have a look 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.070
 You are more creative because you are rapid 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.659
 feasible there are so many recipes and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.610
 then it makes a lot more fun 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 as if you make these standards thing 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.969

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.790
 with the hands that one has such a time 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.200
 better sense for it and then I leave 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.920
 that stop me from arising and after 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.760
