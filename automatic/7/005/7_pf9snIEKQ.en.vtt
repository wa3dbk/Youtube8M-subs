00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
how to hack them so this isn't easier

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.430 
how to hack them so this isn't easier
way<00:00:11.820> than<00:00:11.849> heck<00:00:12.120> set<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:12.990> open<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
way than heck set in you just open the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.929 
way than heck set in you just open the
program<00:00:21.350> okay<00:00:22.380> then<00:00:22.650> you'll<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.160> car<00:00:23.640> spec

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
program okay then you'll get a car spec

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
program okay then you'll get a car spec
this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.230> editing<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> put<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
this is basically editing so you put you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
this is basically editing so you put you
save<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.490> USB<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.359> before<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:30.599> find<00:00:31.080> you

can change colors so I'll put a link in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.630 
can change colors so I'll put a link in
the<00:01:18.330> description<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.310> further<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the description for like further all the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.590 
the description for like further all the
codes

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.150 

this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.720> bodies<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> cars<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.800> could<00:01:25.950> give<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
this is bodies of cars you could give it

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.070 
this is bodies of cars you could give it
a<00:01:26.310> red<00:01:26.520> ball<00:01:26.790> body<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.600> wanted

a red ball body if you really wanted
while<00:01:28.649> some<00:01:28.830> aggression<00:01:31.910> weight<00:01:32.910> multiplier

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
while some aggression weight multiplier

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
while some aggression weight multiplier
engine<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.640> red<00:01:35.790> ball<00:01:36.000> engine

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
engine so you can have a red ball engine

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.139 
engine so you can have a red ball engine
we<00:01:36.390> need<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.660> code<00:01:37.759> horsepower<00:01:38.759> multiplied

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
we need the code horsepower multiplied

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.480 
we need the code horsepower multiplied
to<00:01:39.210> 5<00:01:39.690> 5<00:01:39.899> s<00:01:40.110> max<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.830> I'll<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.399> high

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to 5 5 s max so I'll put it up as high

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
to 5 5 s max so I'll put it up as high
as<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.940> on<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:43.440> engine<00:01:45.020> they're<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
as it can on that engine they're just

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
as it can on that engine they're just
all<00:01:46.380> parts<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.069> then<00:01:47.429> to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.789> your<00:01:47.940> gear

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
all parts and then to do your gear

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.050 
all parts and then to do your gear
ratios<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.229> tune<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.819> all

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
ratios you go on tune you can do all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.309 
ratios you go on tune you can do all
your<00:01:51.209> gears<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.740> 3000<00:01:54.319> you

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
your gears here so I could do 3000 you

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.840 
your gears here so I could do 3000 you
do<00:01:55.440> all<00:01:55.679> your<00:01:55.830> gears<00:01:56.069> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.429> do<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.640> weight

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
do all your gears you can do you weight

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.380 
do all your gears you can do you weight
