I<00:00:45.710> would<00:00:45.949> say<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.000> know<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.420> a

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
I would say you know if you have a

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:48.759 
I would say you know if you have a
couple<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:47.840> different<00:00:47.899> calibers<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.710> you

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
couple of different calibers and you

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.319 
couple of different calibers and you
want<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.010> get<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.160> decent<00:00:49.550> kit<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.879> take<00:00:50.089> care<00:00:50.300> of

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
want to get a decent kit to take care of

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.979 
want to get a decent kit to take care of
your<00:00:50.480> stuff

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
your stuff

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.669 
your stuff
this<00:00:51.649> would<00:00:51.800> fit<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.609> bill<00:00:52.640> just<00:00:53.089> fine<00:00:53.679> I'm

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
this would fit the bill just fine I'm

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.500 
this would fit the bill just fine I'm
not<00:00:54.890> really<00:00:55.039> unhappy<00:00:55.640> with<00:00:55.789> anything<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.300> here

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
not really unhappy with anything in here

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.790 
not really unhappy with anything in here
because<00:00:56.629> again<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.199> get<00:00:57.379> what<00:00:57.499> you<00:00:57.589> pay<00:00:57.769> for

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
because again you get what you pay for

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.669 
because again you get what you pay for
so<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.280> kind<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.609> expect<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.600> quality<00:01:00.050> one

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
so I kind of expect the quality one

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.470 
so I kind of expect the quality one
thing<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.370> kind<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.820> weird<00:01:02.059> with<00:01:02.300> this

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
thing that is kind of weird with this

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.250 
thing that is kind of weird with this
guy<00:01:02.719> is<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.530> different<00:01:04.159> gauge<00:01:05.080> handles<00:01:06.080> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
guy is the different gauge handles and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.680 
guy is the different gauge handles and
stuff<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.740> wish<00:01:07.250> they<00:01:07.430> would<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.450> as

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
stuff I wish they would get it as

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.390 
stuff I wish they would get it as
standardized<00:01:09.440> as<00:01:09.800> possible<00:01:10.490> not<00:01:11.330> every<00:01:12.400> not

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
standardized as possible not every not

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.270 
standardized as possible not every not
every<00:01:13.430> rod<00:01:14.150> will<00:01:14.480> fit<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.260> handles<00:01:15.740> so

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
every rod will fit with the handles so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.800 
every rod will fit with the handles so
you<00:01:16.370> have<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.670> use<00:01:16.790> these<00:01:16.940> little<00:01:17.150> adapters

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
you have to use these little adapters

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.300 
you have to use these little adapters
which<00:01:18.080> is<00:01:18.260> understandable<00:01:18.920> because<00:01:19.010> if

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
which is understandable because if

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.190 
which is understandable because if
you're<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:20.300> know<00:01:20.420> cleaning<00:01:20.810> in<00:01:20.870> a<00:01:20.930> smaller

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
you're you know cleaning in a smaller

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.520 
you're you know cleaning in a smaller
caliber<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.890> need<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.070> smaller<00:01:22.880> rod<00:01:23.570> however

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
caliber you need a smaller rod however

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.860 
caliber you need a smaller rod however
it<00:01:25.280> seems<00:01:25.730> like<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.120> could<00:01:26.180> have<00:01:26.450> gotten<00:01:26.660> it

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
it seems like they could have gotten it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.820 
it seems like they could have gotten it
a<00:01:26.900> little<00:01:27.110> closer<00:01:27.880> there's<00:01:29.320> four<00:01:30.320> different

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
a little closer there's four different

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.040 
a little closer there's four different
rods

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
rods

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.320 
rods
you<00:01:33.050> know<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:33.350> six<00:01:33.740> adapters<00:01:34.460> two<00:01:34.790> handles

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
you know like six adapters two handles

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.090 
you know like six adapters two handles
and<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.840> combination<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.650> trying<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.920> get

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
and the combination of trying to get

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.070 
and the combination of trying to get
that<00:01:37.250> all<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.490> work<00:01:37.640> together<00:01:37.840> gets<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.960> little

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
that all to work together gets a little

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.380 
that all to work together gets a little
troublesome<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:40.220> other<00:01:40.670> than<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:40.970> pretty

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
troublesome but other than that pretty

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.540 
troublesome but other than that pretty
good<00:01:41.840> -<00:01:41.930> kit<00:01:42.110> for<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.350> money<00:01:42.560> again<00:01:43.040> I'd

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
good - kit for the money again I'd

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.100 
good - kit for the money again I'd
recommend<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.330> somebody<00:01:44.690> that's<00:01:44.870> just
