four weeks your dreads aren't could look

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
four weeks your dreads aren't could look
perfect<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> gonna<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:51.090> months<00:01:51.869> maybe

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
perfect it's gonna take months maybe

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
perfect it's gonna take months maybe
years<00:01:52.560> until<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.159> look<00:01:53.340> good<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
years until they look good and you just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.410 
years until they look good and you just
have<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.689> patient<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.350> weigh<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
have to be patient and weigh it out and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.249 
have to be patient and weigh it out and
that's<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> point<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that's the point of it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
that's the point of it
well<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.790> thought<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> whatever<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
well that's but I thought of whatever it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.350 
well that's but I thought of whatever it
was<00:02:00.420> anyway<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.219> lesson<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.640> patience<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
was anyway it's a lesson in patience and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660 
was anyway it's a lesson in patience and
if<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.710> impatient<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> can't

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
if you're that impatient then you can't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
if you're that impatient then you can't
wait<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.119> few<00:02:06.479> months<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> lock<00:02:07.200> up

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
wait a few months for them to lock up

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.630 
wait a few months for them to lock up
then<00:02:07.680> they're<00:02:07.829> probably<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
then they're probably not for you in the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.440 
then they're probably not for you in the
first<00:02:08.789> place<00:02:10.459> in<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.879> opinion<00:02:12.239> there

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
first place in in my opinion there

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.950 
first place in in my opinion there
really<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> journey<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
really is a journey and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.380 
really is a journey and
it's<00:02:14.960> important<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.350> understand<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.770> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's important to understand that and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.610 
it's important to understand that and
you<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.840> they're<00:02:17.990> not<00:02:18.080> gonna<00:02:18.230> perfect

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
you know they're not gonna perfect

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.870
