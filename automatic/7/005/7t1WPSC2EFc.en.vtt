medium grain rice will do I don't think

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
medium grain rice will do I don't think
it'll<00:01:05.549> work<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.119> long<00:01:06.360> grain<00:01:06.600> rice<00:01:06.630> like

basmati so don't try well you could try

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
basmati so don't try well you could try
but<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.799> totally<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> wouldn't<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> half<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810

to be in a single layer and you'll need
to<00:05:17.340> do<00:05:17.490> them<00:05:17.640> in<00:05:17.730> batches<00:05:17.910> probably<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.610> make

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
to do them in batches probably and make

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.400 
to do them in batches probably and make
sure<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.970> get<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.270> get<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.750> oil<00:05:21.870> back<00:05:22.080> up<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
sure you get the get the oil back up to

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.820 
sure you get the get the oil back up to
temperature<00:05:22.710> between<00:05:23.040> each<00:05:23.370> batch<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:25.650> this

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
temperature between each batch so this

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:33.100 
temperature between each batch so this
is<00:05:26.130> our<00:05:26.370> little<00:05:26.490> orange<00:05:27.210> Eno<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:30.830> we'll<00:05:31.830> just

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
is our little orange Eno and we'll just

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.010 
is our little orange Eno and we'll just
keep<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.260> moving<00:05:34.740> because<00:05:34.890> we<00:05:35.130> don't<00:05:35.340> want<00:05:35.490> any

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
keep it moving because we don't want any

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.950 
keep it moving because we don't want any
burnt<00:05:37.020> bits<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:38.220> cook<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.120> cook<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.690> until

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
he's golden brown which will take

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.180 
he's golden brown which will take
probably<00:05:42.030> three<00:05:42.600> or<00:05:42.630> four<00:05:42.690> minutes<00:05:43.110> okay

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
probably three or four minutes okay

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.110 
probably three or four minutes okay
that<00:05:44.460> looks<00:05:44.670> pretty<00:05:45.630> well<00:05:46.200> cooked<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:47.100> me<00:05:47.310> so
