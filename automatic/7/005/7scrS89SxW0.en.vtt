00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.210
 how to repair a wall with flattened 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.400
 cement is first and foremost 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.349
 have the necessary tools 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 to carry out the work these are 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.330
 very common and there are all the prices 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.820
 Even you can make yours 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.640
 tools are a chisel and a hammer 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.349
 a spoon a trowel a plumb one 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.349
 basin and a wooden ruler 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.540
 then remove all that 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.820
 flattened old that is deteriorated is 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.650
 very important that everything be removed 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.420
 what is lazy then of not 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.420
 doing it will end up falling off 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.020
 If necessary use a scaffold to 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.720
 reach the appropriate height and so that 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.090
 your work is easier 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.250
 according to the specifications of the 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.190
 manufacturer that are different for each 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.820
 case we will attach the sand the cement and the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.800
 water to which we will call mixture to 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.090
 we will do to mix the cement and the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 sand until they have 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.740
 successfully incorporated after 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.410
 we will give it a mountain shape 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.660
 we will open a hole simulating the crater of 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.090
 a volcano to pour into it at 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.370
 water this with the idea of ​​not spilling the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 mix and incorporate it from outside towards 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.400
 in 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.600
 with the help of nails and wire 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.670
 we will leave a network that will help us to give 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
 Flattening support after wetting 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.799
 abundantly the wall the filling of 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.110
 the spaces should be with tablespoons 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.909
 generous of thick mixture that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.310
 will win hard to produce 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 pressure to this flattened we'll call it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.909
 rugged 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.290
 if you work in the upper part it is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.700
 convenient to put a pulley to climb and 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.219
 lower the boats with mixture 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 after throwing the mixture there will be 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.590
 take it to level with the rule and the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.869
 plumb after having let the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 previous work to end with a 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 mix a little more watery flatten we have 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.470
 pressing hard this with the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.239
 intention to fill all those 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 holes were this will 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.830
 we will call fine flattened which should 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.959
 being constantly wet for 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.959
 produce an increasingly smooth texture 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:29.250

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.400
 Finally, it only remains to paint it with the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.400
 color of your preference 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.759

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.820
 we hope you like it July 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.820
