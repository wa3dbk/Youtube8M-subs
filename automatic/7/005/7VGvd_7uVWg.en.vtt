00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.840
 those and all those who will find themselves in forums the creation 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.799
 a secret underground tunnel 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.659
 so for 128 8 went to see that 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.429
 so that the materials you will need needed a lazenay plinth and a bucket 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.999
 water 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.039
 and then a little patience retired 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.749
 so she so I built a little house the desires 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 so yes we'll go inside so I can build in one thing 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.490
 just know to show it 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.850
 and there it feels like nothing at all 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.860
 but I'm doing there 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.790
 we will dig 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.830
 pale then farted find themselves 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.809
 we find 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.739
 a secret passage 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.739
 which brings us to a subterranean place 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 so I'll explain how it works 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 to come out 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.740
 we go the other way 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.100
 and we go back 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.670
 and the way those who reformed at all l 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 and it's really handy 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.940
 so it's an infinity 1 it's the usual bike technique so 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 pastry cooks do it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.310
 it works very well 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.180
 so 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.550
 we'll see how it works 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.280
 so 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 already the dimensions they are very very very small and it's a very 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 very great advantage since 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.430
 we pay cash everywhere 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 so we make the yacht 3 out of 22 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 so we dig 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.890
 and for the debt the water 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 on that side 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.870
 dig 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.320
 on the other side 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.370
 and we must leave their 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.740
 in the middle of the two 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.710
 and we're going to have a good time 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.009
 It will do 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.049
 our eye it has produced only sion to fill this club 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 and so not finished 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 so for me what I advise you is a happy 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.979
 to create in europe suda 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.139
 these measures 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.159
 first created below 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.439
 because after this embarrassing party boulala can not do anything 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.519
 so here is zelaya a lawsuit a 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.279
 even if I am a little in the past 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.279
 a kind of cave 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.769
 this is a house 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.289
 complicated in anything 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.119
 So here is 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.689
 to get out 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.689
 so s 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.769
 here 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.989
 we cash blacks 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.659
 France-evening 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.959
 so for a hundred messi the job at home to go up 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.150
 in front of each other 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.479
 like that before showing sick patient 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.719
 so we will be able to go dig 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.189
 I will show you 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.969
 to tobrouk then 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
 we will start by making a hole in the train 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.269
 2 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.269
 and in the other direction 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.159
 we will take 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.949
 like that 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.949
 and put back in the middle 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.750
 what are we going to do 2 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.349
 and at the elbow 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
 we're going to dig a line like this 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.229
 and for going to be able to start digging them 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.229
 right now 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.129
 we start digging a little bit like I have you as I told you 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.869
 here 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.989
 so expensive and month bars 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.109
 I started digging a small hole 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.159
 and in Slovakia immediately for a larceny of the tombola 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.929
 g master it 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.239
 so 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.239
 I set a hundred benchmarks to go back 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.009
 donkalor the materials we will need faure 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.659
 do totally at the end of serial construction at 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.449
 ladders 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.099
 then we will need support for the banks 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.099
 of a single club 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.969
 follows a ride 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:29.489
 of a material could hide or to make a little more Jul 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.209
 so we will go crescendo who manages to equalize doriot 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.349
 it shows a scale that prevents the lot of wounded 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:45.610
 but the ladders hitherto up to the water 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.169
 a proofreading 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.430
 and so 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 we will put a block diagonally 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.699
 in english bonal farah strong car while weapons compared to them rhodes 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
 side 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.279
 alas then heavier than it is always on the biggest side 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.580
 alas the cr in 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.770
 the small gap and that we dug 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.770
 alas it's gone 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.309
 so the 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.309
 the machine is working 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.419
 so more 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.449
 do not forget to put torches 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.849
 cauldron 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.469
 otherwise you have nothing to do 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.289
 so the 8% 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.020
 hamon of former refugees 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.710
 So here is 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.569
 so the chains 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.169
 after meeting 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.169
 will there be the cube to describe 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.270
 and a crazy money 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.270
 then leave 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.860
 so after 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.520
 how it works 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.759
 haidar 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.759
 you build and the work of putting back 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.740
 good the i what i advice you security the others were not building 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.349
 find only 4 5% 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.349
 his strike alas it's a little your land 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.069
 it's simple mark 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.230
 the treasure 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.999
 so 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.960
 I concede conscious as the stones 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.520
 and so 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.619
 the press 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:28.619
 and we reach our secret hiding place 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.729
 so that's it for today 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.369
 so percent and I wish you 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.099
 a good day and percent at the next
