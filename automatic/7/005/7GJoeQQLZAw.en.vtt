00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
focus let's make solo so now you can see

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.760 
focus let's make solo so now you can see
I<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.710> focus<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.670> object<00:02:03.770> let's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I can focus with this to object let's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.980 
I can focus with this to object let's
make<00:02:05.369> another<00:02:05.520> matter<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> change<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
make another matter and change this and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.919 
make another matter and change this and
I<00:02:07.320> make<00:02:07.530> soul<00:02:07.710> again<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.209> how<00:02:09.390> easy<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
I make soul again you can see how easy a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.730 
I make soul again you can see how easy a
kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.259> work<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.870> basically<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
kind of work so basically the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.010 
kind of work so basically the
plug-in<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.340> very<00:02:14.580> helpful<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.720> very

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
plug-in is very helpful you have very

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500 
plug-in is very helpful you have very
complex<00:02:16.470> skins<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.820> don't<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.300> lose

complex skins and you don't want to lose

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740 
complex skins and you don't want to lose
a<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:20.100> don't<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:21.060> example<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.510> want<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
a so you don't for example you want to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.330 
a so you don't for example you want to
make<00:02:21.930> something<00:02:22.170> nice<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.160> move

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
make something nice or you want to move

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.300 
make something nice or you want to move
object<00:02:23.940> very<00:02:24.450> easy<00:02:24.690> when<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.650> simulator

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
object very easy when you have simulator

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.780 
object very easy when you have simulator
you<00:02:26.550> don't<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> walk<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.860> slow<00:02:29.430> down<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you don't want to walk to slow down you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.430 
you don't want to walk to slow down you
cinema4d<00:02:30.060> maybe<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.840> some<00:02:31.020> simulator

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
cinema4d maybe you have some simulator

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.950 
cinema4d maybe you have some simulator
dynamics<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.190> stuff<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.330> can't<00:02:33.720> work

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
dynamics and we stuff so you can't work

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.740 
dynamics and we stuff so you can't work
all<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.470> VIS<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.980> focus<00:02:35.820> object<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.720> can

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
all the VIS or focus object and you can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.430 
all the VIS or focus object and you can
make<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> update<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.670> already

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
make the update and you have already

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.950 
make the update and you have already
