00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
in each box so you can't really get a

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.500 
in each box so you can't really get a
choice<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.340> but<00:05:38.670> each<00:05:38.760> color<00:05:39.030> looks<00:05:39.240> very

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510

smoothly<00:05:44.820> I'm<00:05:45.270> not<00:05:45.690> even<00:05:45.930> wearing<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.590> lip

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860

by<00:06:20.850> this<00:06:20.910> formula<00:06:21.420> the<00:06:21.810> way<00:06:21.960> that<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.200> goes<00:06:22.380> on

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
by this formula the way that it goes on

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.640 
by this formula the way that it goes on
it<00:06:22.890> glides<00:06:23.190> almost<00:06:23.640> on<00:06:23.850> like<00:06:24.120> I<00:06:24.590> don't<00:06:25.590> know

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
it glides almost on like I don't know

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.100 
it glides almost on like I don't know
like<00:06:25.800> jelly<00:06:26.100> like<00:06:26.370> in<00:06:26.610> a<00:06:26.700> way<00:06:26.820> it's<00:06:26.850> so<00:06:27.600> smooth
