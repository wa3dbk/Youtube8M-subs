00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
kate as i said in this one I guess was

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.310 
kate as i said in this one I guess was
just<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.850> little<00:02:55.000> bit<00:02:55.150> childish<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.930> me<00:02:56.140> I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
just a little bit childish for me I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.830 
just a little bit childish for me I
probably<00:02:57.100> would<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.700> enjoyed<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.090> more<00:02:58.270> if<00:02:58.450> i

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
probably would have enjoyed it more if i

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.060 
probably would have enjoyed it more if i
read<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.140> around<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> time<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.680> i<00:02:59.890> read

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070

conflict<00:03:02.710> was<00:03:02.950> kind<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.060> same<00:03:04.210> thing<00:03:04.270> as

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
conflict was kind of the same thing as

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.960 
conflict was kind of the same thing as
