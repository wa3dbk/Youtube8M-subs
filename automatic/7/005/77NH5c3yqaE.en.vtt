00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.949

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 I am happy transition to one year and seven 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 months and I'm always changing cream 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.070

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.239

 straight soft curls 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.000
 they have a light texture and hydrates 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 because they contain silicone glue and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.400

 it has a very smooth profile and does not leave 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.020
 the boxes inside do not contain oil 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.390
 His formula is also very lightweight. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.420

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:57.209
 Swings but if he in the hair 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:03:00.270

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.860

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.250
