stuff<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:08.020> small<00:03:08.230> racks<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.680> found<00:03:08.950> some

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
stuff is just small racks I found some

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.720 
stuff is just small racks I found some
recycled<00:03:12.270> shelving<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.520> I'm<00:03:15.610> gonna

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
recycled shelving and then I'm gonna

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.720 
recycled shelving and then I'm gonna
leave<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.970> base<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.800> plywood<00:03:18.070> base<00:03:18.460> on

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
leave the base on the plywood base on

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.490 
leave the base on the plywood base on
and<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.060> ran<00:03:19.240> screws<00:03:19.630> down<00:03:19.870> through<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
and I ran screws down through it so the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.750 
and I ran screws down through it so the
concrete<00:03:20.860> would<00:03:21.040> hold<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.490> it<00:03:21.520> would<00:03:21.640> all

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
concrete would hold it and it would all

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.680 
concrete would hold it and it would all
hold<00:03:21.910> together<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:23.320> won't<00:03:23.620> warp

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
hold together so won't warp

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.710 
hold together so won't warp
then<00:03:25.690> I'll<00:03:25.870> strip<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.380> off<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.800> side<00:03:27.720> piece

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
then I'll strip this off the side piece

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.390 
then I'll strip this off the side piece
are<00:03:28.900> on<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.140> side<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:31.150> it
