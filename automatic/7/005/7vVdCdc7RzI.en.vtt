00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
flow and what they did is they all took

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.520 
flow and what they did is they all took
a<00:03:31.549> certain<00:03:32.150> chunk<00:03:32.390> they<00:03:32.660> were<00:03:32.720> entitled<00:03:33.109> to<00:03:33.410> a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
a certain chunk they were entitled to a

a certain chunk they were entitled to a
certain<00:03:33.829> amount<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.600> now<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.709> lower

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
certain amount and now that it's lower

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520 
certain amount and now that it's lower
that<00:03:37.730> it's<00:03:37.970> normal<00:03:38.389> amount<00:03:38.690> everyone's<00:03:39.260> still

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that it's normal amount everyone's still

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.170 
that it's normal amount everyone's still
trying<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.889> get<00:03:40.069> that<00:03:40.250> same<00:03:40.519> chunk<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
trying to get that same chunk and the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.710 
trying to get that same chunk and the
problem<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.109> not<00:03:42.380> adding<00:03:42.739> up<00:03:43.720> there's

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
problem is it's not adding up there's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.180 
problem is it's not adding up there's
not<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> drop<00:03:45.530> left<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
not going to be a drop left in the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.820 
not going to be a drop left in the
bucket<00:03:46.610> if<00:03:46.790> they<00:03:47.569> keep<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:48.019> up<00:03:48.080> because<00:03:48.650> it's

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
bucket if they keep this up because it's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.309 
bucket if they keep this up because it's
not<00:03:48.980> replenishing<00:03:49.730> itself

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
not replenishing itself

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.550 
not replenishing itself
is<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.560> thing<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.040> while<00:03:51.939> everyone's<00:03:52.560> looking

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
is the thing so while everyone's looking

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.679 
is the thing so while everyone's looking
out<00:03:53.709> here<00:03:53.980> at<00:03:54.189> California<00:03:54.939> I<00:03:55.150> want<00:03:55.540> them<00:03:55.629> to

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
out here at California I want them to

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.300 
out here at California I want them to
know<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.139> bigger<00:03:56.319> problem<00:03:56.859> has<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.159> do

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
know that the bigger problem has to do

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.190 
know that the bigger problem has to do
with<00:03:57.579> where<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.269> all<00:03:58.420> coming<00:03:58.810> from<00:03:58.840> from

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
with where it's all coming from from

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.330 
with where it's all coming from from

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
lot more than just California and once

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.170 
lot more than just California and once
again<00:04:07.299> never<00:04:07.689> no<00:04:07.870> mention<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.290> primary<00:04:08.799> water

hmm<00:04:10.180> seems<00:04:11.170> they<00:04:11.319> go<00:04:11.439> out<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.799> way<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.730> not

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
hmm seems they go out of the way to not

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.620 
hmm seems they go out of the way to not
