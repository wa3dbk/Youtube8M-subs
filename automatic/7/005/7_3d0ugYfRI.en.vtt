northern Oregon doing a little mini demo
this<00:00:05.130> one<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.520> skies<00:00:06.000> if<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.109> look<00:00:07.259> closely<00:00:07.500> in

this one on skies if you look closely in

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.830 
this one on skies if you look closely in
the<00:00:09.090> screen<00:00:09.780> right<00:00:10.320> now<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.980> will<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
the screen right now you will see a

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.700 
the screen right now you will see a
little<00:00:12.840> bit<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.769> white<00:00:14.309> cloud<00:00:14.809> light<00:00:15.809> sky<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
a suggestion of shadows on the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
a suggestion of shadows on the
undersides<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.900> side<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.970> this

undersides and to the right side of this
cloud<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.570> particular<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.560> gray<00:00:25.769> right

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
cloud in particular see that gray right

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.810 
cloud in particular see that gray right
here<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> nifty<00:00:28.980> technique<00:00:29.519> for

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here so this is a nifty technique for

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.959 
here so this is a nifty technique for
and<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.960> simple<00:00:31.320> technique<00:00:31.730> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
and a very simple technique I'm going to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
and a very simple technique I'm going to
complicate<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.480> ever<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.020> slightly<00:00:34.350> by

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
complicate it ever so slightly by

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
complicate it ever so slightly by
including<00:00:35.550> two<00:00:36.020> different<00:00:37.340> colors<00:00:38.340> blue<00:00:39.239> for

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
including two different colors blue for

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.350 
including two different colors blue for
the<00:00:39.480> sky<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.020> great<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> shadows<00:00:41.360> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the sky and great for the shadows and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.990 
the sky and great for the shadows and
what<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:44.070> mix<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.910> color

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
what you do is you mix up your color

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
what you do is you mix up your color
here<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:51.260> then<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> paint

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here which I will do now then you paint

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.660 
here which I will do now then you paint
clear<00:00:53.190> water<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.230> sky<00:00:55.760> area<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:01.670> leave

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
clear water on the sky area and leave

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
clear water on the sky area and leave
some<00:01:02.940> whites<00:01:03.149> leave<00:01:03.809> some<00:01:04.129> areas<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
some whites leave some areas of the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.469 
some whites leave some areas of the
paper<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.320> basically<00:01:08.210> untouched<00:01:09.210> I'm

with plenty of water and skip some areas
of<00:02:35.090> white<00:02:36.190> paper<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.520> are<00:02:37.790> left<00:02:38.210> dry<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.010> not

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
of white paper that are left dry and not

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.550 
of white paper that are left dry and not
touched<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.300> water<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.500> to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
touched with the water is this going to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.680 
touched with the water is this going to
be<00:02:45.620> basically<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.100> sky<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.820> we<00:02:46.940> keep<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.270> simple

in a minute

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.860 
in a minute
I<00:03:11.420> take<00:03:12.050> my<00:03:12.260> brush<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.920> has<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:14.239> bloom<00:03:14.510> in<00:03:14.720> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
I take my brush that has the bloom in it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.790 
I take my brush that has the bloom in it
first<00:03:15.470> get<00:03:16.400> plenty<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:17.110> pigment<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.230> water<00:03:18.560> in

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
first get plenty of pigment and water in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.790 
first get plenty of pigment and water in
that<00:03:19.010> brush<00:03:19.250> they<00:03:19.730> come<00:03:19.940> across<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.800> I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
that brush they come across here and I

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.820 
that brush they come across here and I
form<00:03:22.160> some<00:03:22.400> cloud<00:03:22.640> shapes<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:27.590> across

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
form some cloud shapes when I go across

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.750 
form some cloud shapes when I go across
the<00:03:28.130> areas<00:03:28.550> where<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.030> paper<00:03:29.270> is<00:03:29.540> dry<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:31.400> as

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the areas where the paper is dry like as

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.930 
the areas where the paper is dry like as
in<00:03:32.030> here<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.630> here<00:03:33.110> right<00:03:33.920> here<00:03:34.400> at<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
in here and here right here at the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.210 
in here and here right here at the
moment<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:37.670> get<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.910> sort<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:40.750> hard<00:03:41.750> edge

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
moment you get a sort of hard edge

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.880 
moment you get a sort of hard edge
effect<00:03:43.220> which<00:03:43.510> gives<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.989> line<00:03:45.680> of

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
effect which gives you a line of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.360 
effect which gives you a line of
definition<00:03:46.610> for<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.630> clouds<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.320> just<00:03:49.130> kind<00:03:49.310> of

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
definition for the clouds I just kind of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.340 
definition for the clouds I just kind of
fill<00:03:49.610> in<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.790> sky<00:03:50.180> area<00:03:50.600> at<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> top<00:03:50.989> not

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
fill in the sky area at the top not

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.220 
fill in the sky area at the top not
really<00:03:51.590> necessary<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:53.090> what<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.540> does<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:54.050> it

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
really necessary but what it does is it

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.340 
really necessary but what it does is it
gives<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.739> better<00:03:55.040> feeling<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.880> it's<00:03:56.030> a

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
gives you a better feeling that it's a

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.860 
gives you a better feeling that it's a
sky<00:03:57.350> up<00:03:57.560> here<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:57.980> not<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.510> much<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> blue

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
sky up here and not just much a blue

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.089 
sky up here and not just much a blue
paint<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.739> paper<00:04:01.840> come<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:02.959> here

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.350 

with<00:04:09.099> some<00:04:09.310> areas<00:04:09.700> like<00:04:09.910> that

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
with some areas like that

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.250 
with some areas like that
that's<00:04:10.690> my<00:04:10.900> blue<00:04:11.340> no<00:04:12.420> well<00:04:13.420> I've<00:04:13.540> still<00:04:13.870> go<00:04:14.200> to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
that's my blue no well I've still go to

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.580 
that's my blue no well I've still go to
where<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:15.090> take<00:04:16.090> my<00:04:16.269> gray<00:04:16.570> let's<00:04:17.109> say<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
where I take my gray let's say that the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.530 
where I take my gray let's say that the
sunlight<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:18.130> coming<00:04:18.400> from<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.940> upper<00:04:19.299> left

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
sunlight is coming from the upper left

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.730 
sunlight is coming from the upper left
down<00:04:20.290> this<00:04:20.560> way<00:04:20.799> here<00:04:21.210> right<00:04:22.210> like<00:04:22.389> that<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.840> I

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
down this way here right like that so I

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.100 
down this way here right like that so I
come<00:04:24.040> into<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.340> cloud<00:04:24.550> areas<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:27.550> add

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
come into the cloud areas and I add

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.790 
come into the cloud areas and I add
little<00:04:29.110> gray<00:04:31.169> aiming<00:04:32.169> toward<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.560> right<00:04:32.770> side

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
little gray aiming toward the right side

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.980 
little gray aiming toward the right side
for<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> shadow<00:04:33.910> areas<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.720> clouds

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
for the shadow areas of the clouds

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.590 
for the shadow areas of the clouds
because<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.830> basically<00:04:36.450> where<00:04:37.450> they

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
because that's basically where they

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.050 
because that's basically where they
would<00:04:37.780> be<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.910> quick<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.430> lay<00:04:42.430> down<00:04:42.610> that<00:04:42.790> brush

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
would be so quick I lay down that brush

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.909 
would be so quick I lay down that brush
pick<00:04:43.360> up<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.630> brush<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.080> has<00:04:44.260> just<00:04:44.530> water

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
pick up the brush that has just water

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.969 
pick up the brush that has just water
this<00:04:45.550> is<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.760> one<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.630> half<00:04:46.780> inch<00:04:47.110> just

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
use don't want to put too much water in

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.000 
use don't want to put too much water in
there<00:04:51.250> got<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.210> little<00:04:52.240> too<00:04:52.660> much<00:04:52.780> water<00:04:52.990> but<00:04:53.860> it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
there got a little too much water but it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.040 
there got a little too much water but it
should<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.370> alright<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:55.810> kind<00:04:56.020> of

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
should be alright and just kind of

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.860 
should be alright and just kind of
soften<00:04:56.500> those<00:04:56.620> edges<00:04:56.889> as<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.460> floats<00:04:57.760> up<00:04:57.970> into

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
soften those edges as it floats up into

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.960 
soften those edges as it floats up into
the<00:04:58.990> clouds<00:04:59.260> there<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:02.520> what<00:05:03.520> I've<00:05:03.639> done<00:05:03.910> here

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the clouds there so what I've done here

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.219 
the clouds there so what I've done here
is<00:05:04.540> created<00:05:05.110> some<00:05:05.320> clouds<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:06.190> can<00:05:06.430> see

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
is created some clouds and I can see

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.000 
is created some clouds and I can see
here<00:05:08.229> I'm<00:05:08.500> thinking<00:05:08.530> up<00:05:08.950> a<00:05:09.100> coloring<00:05:09.910> with<00:05:10.060> my

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
here I'm thinking up a coloring with my

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.159 
here I'm thinking up a coloring with my
pure<00:05:12.010> water<00:05:12.280> brush<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.880> now<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.180> I'd<00:05:13.990> have

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
pure water brush and now it's I'd have

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.810 
pure water brush and now it's I'd have
to<00:05:14.289> clean<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.950> use<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.340> I<00:05:15.460> want<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.700> get

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
to clean it out to use it I want to get

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.570 
to clean it out to use it I want to get
those<00:05:16.289> paints<00:05:17.289> great<00:05:17.500> drives<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.950> lot<00:05:18.220> lighter

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
those paints great drives a lot lighter

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.690 
those paints great drives a lot lighter
you<00:05:19.570> know<00:05:19.690> like<00:05:20.020> 30<00:05:20.289> 40<00:05:20.740> percent<00:05:21.190> or<00:05:21.340> whatever

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
you know like 30 40 percent or whatever

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.879 
you know like 30 40 percent or whatever
somewhere<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.150> there<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.470> wanted<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.710> get

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
somewhere in there so I wanted to get

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.600 
somewhere in there so I wanted to get
those<00:05:24.450> shadows<00:05:25.450> in<00:05:25.690> those<00:05:25.870> clouds<00:05:26.260> a<00:05:28.410> little

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
those shadows in those clouds a little

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:38.159 
those shadows in those clouds a little
better<00:05:34.560> like<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.419> see<00:05:37.570> how<00:05:37.870> simple

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
better like that so you see how simple

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.340 
better like that so you see how simple
that<00:05:38.380> was<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.770> wet<00:05:39.310> my<00:05:39.460> paper<00:05:39.760> maybe<00:05:40.630> I<00:05:40.780> let<00:05:41.080> the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
that was I wet my paper maybe I let the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.550 
that was I wet my paper maybe I let the
water<00:05:42.310> soak<00:05:42.669> in<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.210> little<00:05:43.810> bit<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.260> paper

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
water soak in a little bit to the paper

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.200 
water soak in a little bit to the paper
and<00:05:45.100> left<00:05:46.080> purposefully<00:05:47.080> some<00:05:48.070> dry<00:05:48.400> areas<00:05:49.030> on

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
and left purposefully some dry areas on

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.409 
and left purposefully some dry areas on
the<00:05:49.300> paper<00:05:49.539> that<00:05:49.720> were<00:05:50.260> untouched<00:05:50.740> by<00:05:50.979> the

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
the paper that were untouched by the

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.140 
the paper that were untouched by the
water<00:05:52.419> that<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.780> pre<00:05:53.169> wet<00:05:53.320> it<00:05:53.440> with<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.610> that's

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
water that I pre wet it with so that's

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.430 
water that I pre wet it with so that's
important<00:05:55.900> so<00:05:57.330> when<00:05:58.330> we<00:05:58.510> have<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.810> dry<00:05:58.990> areas

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
important so when we have the dry areas

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.010 
important so when we have the dry areas
and<00:05:59.680> you<00:05:59.740> get<00:06:00.729> these<00:06:00.849> little<00:06:01.090> rough<00:06:01.389> edges<00:06:01.660> to

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
and you get these little rough edges to

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.680 
and you get these little rough edges to
the<00:06:02.169> clouds<00:06:02.440> which<00:06:02.860> provide<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.280> nice<00:06:03.690> contrast

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
the clouds which provide a nice contrast

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.529 
the clouds which provide a nice contrast
to<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:05.050> very<00:06:05.979> soft<00:06:06.400> effects<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:07.090> those<00:06:07.270> clouds

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
to the very soft effects of those clouds

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.620 
to the very soft effects of those clouds
at<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.380> same<00:06:08.620> time<00:06:08.979> like<00:06:09.970> you'd<00:06:10.180> see<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.389> little

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
at the same time like you'd see a little

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.399 
at the same time like you'd see a little
dry<00:06:10.900> area<00:06:11.289> right<00:06:11.800> here<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:12.900> some<00:06:13.900> over<00:06:13.960> here

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
dry area right here and some over here

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.649 
dry area right here and some over here
that<00:06:14.650> perhaps<00:06:15.130> aren't<00:06:15.640> too<00:06:15.849> good<00:06:16.060> but<00:06:16.330> you

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
that perhaps aren't too good but you

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.350 
that perhaps aren't too good but you
know<00:06:16.780> we<00:06:16.990> could<00:06:17.140> modify<00:06:17.409> those<00:06:17.740> if<00:06:17.979> this<00:06:18.430> is

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
know we could modify those if this is

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.420 
know we could modify those if this is
important<00:06:20.360> painting<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:20.930> me<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.590> what's<00:06:22.280> not

important painting to me and what's not
important<00:06:22.880> is<00:06:22.970> how<00:06:23.780> will<00:06:23.990> I<00:06:24.020> pull<00:06:24.350> this<00:06:24.530> off<00:06:24.710> or

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280

about<00:06:32.449> it<00:06:32.810> by<00:06:33.139> leaving<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.530> dry<00:06:33.740> areas

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310

gray and I use simple pigments I'm not

gray and I use simple pigments I'm not
advocating<00:06:44.180> to<00:06:44.570> use<00:06:44.750> these<00:06:44.960> particular

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
advocating to use these particular

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.950 
advocating to use these particular
pigments<00:06:46.009> for<00:06:46.100> a<00:06:46.160> sky<00:06:46.490> you<00:06:47.000> can<00:06:47.150> use<00:06:47.360> whatever

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
pigments for a sky you can use whatever

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.020 
pigments for a sky you can use whatever
pigments<00:06:48.650> you<00:06:48.770> like<00:06:49.039> and<00:06:49.370> whatever<00:06:49.580> colors

pigments you like and whatever colors
for<00:06:50.270> instance<00:06:50.300> I<00:06:50.690> can<00:06:50.960> get<00:06:51.199> this<00:06:51.349> gray<00:06:51.590> real

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
for instance I can get this gray real

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.890 
for instance I can get this gray real
well<00:06:52.190> out<00:06:52.460> of<00:06:52.610> ultramarine<00:06:53.240> blue<00:06:53.330> and<00:06:53.539> vert

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
well out of ultramarine blue and vert

well out of ultramarine blue and vert
Sienna<00:06:56.020> actually<00:06:57.020> a<00:06:57.050> better<00:06:57.199> great<00:06:57.470> I<00:06:57.770> could

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
Sienna actually a better great I could

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.040 
Sienna actually a better great I could
use<00:06:59.199> cerulean<00:07:00.199> blue<00:07:00.410> up<00:07:00.590> here<00:07:00.889> or<00:07:01.690> almost<00:07:02.690> pure

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
use cerulean blue up here or almost pure

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.010 
use cerulean blue up here or almost pure
silo<00:07:03.949> blue<00:07:04.250> up<00:07:04.460> here<00:07:04.490> or<00:07:05.060> mix<00:07:05.479> it<00:07:05.630> a<00:07:05.690> little<00:07:05.900> bit

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
silo blue up here or mix it a little bit

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.680 
silo blue up here or mix it a little bit
like<00:07:06.169> I<00:07:06.289> did<00:07:06.470> with<00:07:06.680> ultramarine<00:07:07.370> blue<00:07:07.690> the

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
like I did with ultramarine blue the

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.089 
like I did with ultramarine blue the
colors<00:07:08.990> are<00:07:09.169> up<00:07:09.259> to<00:07:09.380> you<00:07:09.500> but<00:07:09.710> it's<00:07:09.949> the

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:10.099 
colors are up to you but it's the

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.310 
colors are up to you but it's the
technique<00:07:10.580> that<00:07:10.880> I'm<00:07:11.449> demonstrating<00:07:11.660> here

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
technique that I'm demonstrating here

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.110 
technique that I'm demonstrating here
today<00:07:12.620> and<00:07:12.740> it's<00:07:12.889> a<00:07:12.949> fairly<00:07:13.160> simple<00:07:13.490> technique

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
today and it's a fairly simple technique

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.779 
today and it's a fairly simple technique
and<00:07:14.300> very<00:07:14.470> effective<00:07:15.470> particularly<00:07:16.370> when<00:07:16.699> you

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
and very effective particularly when you

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.689 
and very effective particularly when you
want<00:07:17.060> a<00:07:17.210> sky<00:07:17.720> a<00:07:18.080> little<00:07:18.740> water<00:07:19.130> cooling<00:07:19.550> down

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
want a sky a little water cooling down

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.460 
want a sky a little water cooling down
here<00:07:20.050> that<00:07:21.050> is<00:07:21.410> rather<00:07:22.370> dynamic<00:07:22.729> and<00:07:23.440> got<00:07:24.440> a

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
here that is rather dynamic and got a

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.110 
here that is rather dynamic and got a
lot<00:07:24.710> going<00:07:25.039> on<00:07:25.190> up<00:07:25.699> here

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
lot going on up here

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.689 
lot going on up here
in<00:07:26.240> the<00:07:26.659> cloud<00:07:26.930> area<00:07:27.590> so<00:07:27.860> that's<00:07:28.070> the<00:07:28.490> mini

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 
in the cloud area so that's the mini
