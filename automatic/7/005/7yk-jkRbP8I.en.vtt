00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hello my dear friends, well, today we are going 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.980
 to start with this makeup today is going to 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.840
 be something quick there is no introduction nor 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.689
 nothing, I just wanted to show you how 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.270
 make this cute moon makeup that 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.470
 very very easy to perform and I think it 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.320
 It looks very cute and different in that time of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.900
 summer those colors are perfect so 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.990
 how good are we going to start with the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.330
 makeup I hope you like it and not 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.280
 forget to leave me your comments and 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.070
 those that still in the subscribed the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.800
 I hope in my channel that they subscribe and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 tell me about my videos 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.290
 well the first thing I'm going to do in this 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.530
 makeup as I always like to apply 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.869
 a prebase on my eyelids 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.250
 then I'm going to start using 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.350
 this prebase is a pre base of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.960
 everton like it seems to me is not a test 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 only to remove the color from 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.700
 eyelid that's super important because 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.250
 the makeup does not look the same when not 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.380
 we correct this area so that's what 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 first we have to do and how 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.110
 second what I'm going to do is apply a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.850
 loose powder to seal what we have already 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 applied as pre-base 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 then what I 'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 start with a transition color this 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.180
 color can be a salmon color or a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.330
 brick color and this color we're going to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.580
 place only in the eye socket and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.659
 let's start with a brush for 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.780
 blur to spread the product but 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.180
 without reaching the bone part of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.759
 the eyebrows only in the part of the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.080
 eye basin and a little bit like 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.880
 coming to the tear and brush come on 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.920
 working the product a little bit 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.519
 little bit up but you do not have to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.050
 get to the sea as I repeat 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.810
 only in the eye socket to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.810
 give depth to that eyelid 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.930
 in circular motions at the best 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.780
 way of how you can blur 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.960
 these products so that we stay as 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 that tuxedo effect or smoked effect 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.700
 let say 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.000
 is the easiest way as you 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.459
 can not perform right now I do not 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.709
 I have taught some other way of how I 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.900
 can you do this is the way I 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.700
 have seen doing it in all the videos and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.020
 What I like to do is do as 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.459
 Circulitos and work the makeup with 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.459
 sufficiently long enough 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.660
 now if you tend now take a tone 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.030
 coffee and only apply it in the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.370
 little corner of the eyes and we are giving 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.460
 little bit in depth and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.050
 we are seeing our eyes 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.050
 so that they remain the same 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.080
 now for the little bone of 6 apply 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.150
 a tone an illuminator pretty clear and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.799
 If you look only apply it in 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 eyebrows of about half the cea 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.650
 outwards then I took another brochita 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.920
 to integrate the colors then I'm going to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.739
 Curl my eyelashes and apply mascara 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.170
 tabs in a normal way and I'm going to apply 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.470
 my false eyelashes if they were fixed is 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.540
 quite simple this makeup and it 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.220
 see completely different you see a 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.599
 pretty cute and different makeup 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 that's what I like about this 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.069
 makeup now I'm going to take this milk 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.019
 here is my eyeliner this 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.260
 revlon eyeliners in the video 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.879
 Last I told them that it was one of my 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.670
 my favorite eyeliners in colors 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.129
 because it's a pretty makeup 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.950
 vibrant and as they see it in the 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.109
 lid stays on the skin so I love 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.450
 the blue color in the eyes I feel that we 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.669
 It gives quite expression 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.709
 so that's why I wanted to use this 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.230
 color apart that is a pretty color 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.230
 cute for these summer days 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.920
 I'll do my normal line we will 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.950
 make sure that the two lines 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.950
 in the same height and the same thickness 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.080
 Now I'm going to apply my lashes 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.330
 you can do it with a 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.860
 clamp if it's easier for me to 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.640
 sometimes I do it with a clamp sometimes what 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.630
 I do with my little hands there are not like you 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.370
 you get better and feel more comfortable 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.290
 and the only thing they have to make sure of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.889
 adjust it pretty well and stay 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:10.159
 well stuck on the edge of our eye 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.259
 now I'm going to take a nude color tone and 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.360
 I'm going to apply it from the inside 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.509
 this to make the eyes see us 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.080
 a little bit bigger and I'm going to apply 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.930
 a brownish tone on the bottom 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.020
 to give a little more intensity to the 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.110
 color although in the end I'm honest 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.210
 the nude color inside the eye does not 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.389
 it seemed like a lot so I changed it and put it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.939
 a dark color but of the two forms 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.580
 the makeup I think it is looks very 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.860
 cute although sometimes suddenly changed 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.300
 the colors or did not change the colors 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.340
 lipsticks i like to try things 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.040
 different then 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.740
 Well, this would basically be the result 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.780
 final I put a lipstick a little strong 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.860
 can use an orange tone a tone 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.010
 red a tone like pink both good 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.449
 they all look pretty and look 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.760
 quite vibrant so good that 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.699
 it would be the final result as I told you 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.669
 it's pretty easy to do even if you do not 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.610
 they have this delineated this eyeliner 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.020
 sorry can make this makeup like 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.180
 a day makeup a makeup 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.789
 pretty natural but what 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.800
 It is perfect for any occasion but 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.850
 if we want to bring a little more color 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.009
 it's the perfect makeup to me 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:36.840
 love and I love how they move 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:39.090
 eyes are expressive sexy elegant as well 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.340
 good friends that would be basically everything 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.289
 I hope you liked it and do not forget
