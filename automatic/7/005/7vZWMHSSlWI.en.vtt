Ripper on a few acres just to see what

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
Ripper on a few acres just to see what
it<00:00:58.440> looked<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.710> compared<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.520> using<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> disc

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it looked like compared to using a disc

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
it looked like compared to using a disc
following<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> chisel<00:01:01.500> plow<00:01:01.829> and

following up with a chisel plow and
getting<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.000> pass<00:01:03.300> instead<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
getting one pass instead of two is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.530 
getting one pass instead of two is
always<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> good<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> job<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
always a good thing but would the job be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.020
