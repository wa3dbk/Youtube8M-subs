presupposes that it was after the time

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.810 
presupposes that it was after the time
of<00:00:50.910> Moses<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.460> Pentateuch

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of Moses and so all of the Pentateuch

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
of Moses and so all of the Pentateuch
can't<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.090> written<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.420> Moses<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
can't be written by Moses if that just

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
can't be written by Moses if that just
wouldn't<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.430> been<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
wouldn't have been there or you know

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
wouldn't have been there or you know
they<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> account<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> Moses<00:00:58.949> death

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they you have the account of Moses death

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
they you have the account of Moses death
and<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.449> happened<00:01:00.690> afterwards<00:01:01.109> what's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and it what happened afterwards what's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.100 
and it what happened afterwards what's
very<00:01:01.559> unlikely<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> Moses<00:01:02.370> wrote<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> one

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
very unlikely that Moses wrote that one

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
very unlikely that Moses wrote that one
and<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> number<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.460> pieces<00:01:06.299> of

and there's a number of pieces of

it wasn't a matter of a bunch of bishops
getting<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> room<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.680> voting<00:01:20.040> or

about<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> Bible<00:01:25.110> came<00:01:25.439> together<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
about how the Bible came together the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.060 
about how the Bible came together the
the<00:01:26.700> early<00:01:27.000> church<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> cannon<00:01:28.740> long

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
before they ever formalized it and the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.859 
before they ever formalized it and the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
they were forced to canonize the Bible

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
they were forced to canonize the Bible
to<00:02:00.750> come<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.079> an<00:02:01.170> official<00:02:01.590> Canon<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.679 
to come up with an official Canon and
that<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.640> only<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.420> another

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that was only because there's another

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
that was only because there's another
guy<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> real<00:02:04.469> popular<00:02:04.710> Chris

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
guy out there a real popular Chris

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
guy out there a real popular Chris
mattock<00:02:05.520> preacher<00:02:05.729> named<00:02:06.000> Marcion<00:02:06.540> who<00:02:07.170> came

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
mattock preacher named Marcion who came

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.510 
mattock preacher named Marcion who came
up<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.770> his<00:02:07.920> own<00:02:08.009> Bible

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
up with his own Bible

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.960 
up with his own Bible
he<00:02:08.940> was<00:02:09.149> an<00:02:09.899> anti-semite<00:02:10.890> hated<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> Jews<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
he was an anti-semite hated the Jews and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430 
he was an anti-semite hated the Jews and
so<00:02:12.480> he

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so he

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
so he
a<00:02:13.470> brand<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.040> Christianity<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.760> was

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
a brand of Christianity that was

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.970 
a brand of Christianity that was
anti-jewish<00:02:15.600> which<00:02:16.260> means<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.620> had<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.740> cut

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
anti-jewish which means he had to cut

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.220 
anti-jewish which means he had to cut
out<00:02:17.100> all<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.580> parts<00:02:17.820> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> Bible<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.110> were

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
out all the parts of the Bible that were

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.360 
out all the parts of the Bible that were
Jewish<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:19.680> that's<00:02:19.800> pretty<00:02:19.980> hard<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> do

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
Jewish now that's pretty hard to do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.420 
Jewish now that's pretty hard to do
since<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.060> thoroughly<00:02:21.420> Jewish<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.380> know

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
since it's a thoroughly Jewish you know

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.370 
since it's a thoroughly Jewish you know
body<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.580> literature<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.570> he<00:02:24.780> cut<00:02:25.020> out<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
body of literature but he cut out you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.870 
body of literature but he cut out you
know<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.220> he<00:02:26.340> didn't<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
know what all that he didn't like and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.460 
know what all that he didn't like and
just<00:02:26.970> kept<00:02:27.210> what<00:02:27.360> he<00:02:27.420> did<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.020> I've

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
just kept what he did like and I've

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
just kept what he did like and I've
started<00:02:28.650> preaching<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.340> being<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.850> true

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
started preaching that as being the true

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.940 
started preaching that as being the true
version<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.540> Christianity<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> church

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
version of Christianity so the church

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250 
version of Christianity so the church
had<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.280> say<00:02:32.460> we<00:02:32.580> don't<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:34.020> people

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
had to say we don't know because people

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.230 
had to say we don't know because people
following<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.920> guy<00:02:35.100> they<00:02:35.700> had<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> say<00:02:36.090> look

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
following this guy they had to say look

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.580 
following this guy they had to say look
at<00:02:36.330> here's<00:02:36.690> what<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> church<00:02:37.230> has<00:02:37.410> always

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
at here's what the church has always

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.830 
at here's what the church has always
believed<00:02:37.950> as<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> Canon<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.450> they<00:02:39.600> they

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
believed as the Canon and so they they

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.620 
believed as the Canon and so they they
didn't<00:02:40.020> create<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.560> Canon<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.760> around<00:02:41.940> 140

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
didn't create the Canon but around 140

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.470 
didn't create the Canon but around 140
they<00:02:42.750> formalized<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.800> Canon<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:45.330> how

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
they formalized the Canon and that's how

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.840 
they formalized the Canon and that's how
we<00:02:45.540> came<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.340> New<00:02:47.460> Testament

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
we came to have the the New Testament

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.950 
we came to have the the New Testament
that<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.180> today<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.420> as<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.600> similar

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
that we have today and as a similar

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.200 
that we have today and as a similar
process<00:02:52.200> went<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.740> with<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.700> Jewish

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
process went on with the the Jewish

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.060 
process went on with the the Jewish
Canon<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> question<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.260> how<00:02:55.740> was<00:02:55.860> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
Canon now the question is how was that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.360 
Canon now the question is how was that
compatible<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:57.090> divine<00:02:57.390> inspiration<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
compatible with divine inspiration and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.050 
compatible with divine inspiration and
my<00:02:59.550> response<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.710> why<00:03:01.710> think<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.850> is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
my response is why think that that is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.380 
my response is why think that that is
not<00:03:03.300> compatible<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.930> divine<00:03:04.290> inspiration

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
not compatible with divine inspiration

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.790 
not compatible with divine inspiration
divine<00:03:06.390> inspiration<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:07.290> inspiration<00:03:07.320> of

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
divine inspiration the inspiration of

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.780 
divine inspiration the inspiration of
the<00:03:07.890> Bible

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
the Bible

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760 
the Bible
it<00:03:09.090> doesn't<00:03:09.420> attach<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.050> process<00:03:10.620> by

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
it doesn't attach to the process by

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.130 
it doesn't attach to the process by
which<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.100> Bible<00:03:11.430> came<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.780> attaches

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
which the Bible came to be it attaches

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.390 
which the Bible came to be it attaches
to<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.650> result<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> process<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> one

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to the result of the process and so one

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.500 
to the result of the process and so one
need<00:03:17.580> only<00:03:17.610> believe<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.090> God

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
need only believe that God

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.630 
need only believe that God
providentially<00:03:18.950> oversaw<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.430> much<00:03:20.610> as

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
providentially oversaw this as much as

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.120 
providentially oversaw this as much as
he<00:03:20.880> needed<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.870> ensure<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.320> what<00:03:23.010> he

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
he needed to to ensure that what he

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.070 
he needed to to ensure that what he
really<00:03:23.370> wanted<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.790> told<00:03:24.000> was<00:03:24.300> told<00:03:24.600> what

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
really wanted to be told was told what

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.390 
really wanted to be told was told what
he<00:03:25.140> didn't<00:03:25.350> want<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.590> told<00:03:25.830> was<00:03:25.980> left<00:03:26.190> out

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
he didn't want to be told was left out

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.340 
he didn't want to be told was left out
and<00:03:26.790> whatever<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.600> conditions<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.260> had

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
and whatever you know conditions you had

because<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.210> me<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.450> doesn't<00:05:12.660> argue<00:05:13.260> against

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
because to me it doesn't argue against

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.100 
because to me it doesn't argue against
divine<00:05:14.250> inspiration<00:05:14.850> it<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.240> tells<00:05:15.570> us<00:05:15.660> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
divine inspiration it just tells us the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.470 
divine inspiration it just tells us the
way<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.380> God<00:05:16.980> brought<00:05:17.430> about<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:18.150> book<00:05:18.360> you

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
way that God brought about the book you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.000 
way that God brought about the book you
wanted<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.720> bring<00:05:18.840> about<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.560> doesn't<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.890> all

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
wanted to bring about it doesn't it all

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.380 
wanted to bring about it doesn't it all
negate<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> fact<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.730> God<00:05:20.970> was<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.270> one

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
negate the fact that God was the one

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.350 
negate the fact that God was the one
doing<00:05:21.690> it<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:23.370> kind<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.640> parallel<00:05:23.940> if<00:05:24.270> you

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
doing it it's kind of a parallel if you

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.090 
doing it it's kind of a parallel if you
will<00:05:24.540> between<00:05:25.170> yeah<00:05:25.590> jump<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:25.920> real<00:05:26.070> quick

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
will between yeah jump in real quick

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.210 
will between yeah jump in real quick
otherwise<00:05:26.430> just<00:05:26.670> keep<00:05:26.790> on<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.980> you<00:05:28.980> know<00:05:29.070> to

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
otherwise just keep on going you know to

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.590 
otherwise just keep on going you know to
me<00:05:29.310> there's<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.580> kind<00:05:29.910> of<00:05:29.970> parallel<00:05:30.360> some

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
me there's a kind of parallel some

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.330 
me there's a kind of parallel some
people<00:05:30.780> think<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.050> evolutionary<00:05:31.680> theory<00:05:32.190> is

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
people think that evolutionary theory is

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.710 
people think that evolutionary theory is
against<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.820> idea<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.180> we're<00:05:33.330> made<00:05:33.510> in<00:05:33.630> the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
against the idea that we're made in the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.380 
against the idea that we're made in the
image<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.990> God<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.440> I'm<00:05:34.710> wondering<00:05:35.190> why

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
image of God and I'm wondering why

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.720 
image of God and I'm wondering why
because<00:05:36.390> if<00:05:37.130> evolutionary<00:05:38.130> theory<00:05:38.400> is<00:05:38.490> true

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
because if evolutionary theory is true

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.700 
because if evolutionary theory is true
and<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.180> tend<00:05:39.420> to<00:05:39.480> think<00:05:39.630> that<00:05:39.720> at<00:05:40.110> least<00:05:40.170> in<00:05:40.500> its

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
and I tend to think that at least in its

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.430 
and I tend to think that at least in its
core<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.280> is<00:05:41.660> though<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.690> don't<00:05:43.020> care<00:05:43.230> enough<00:05:43.290> to

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
core it is though I don't care enough to

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.560 
core it is though I don't care enough to
argue<00:05:43.860> much<00:05:43.980> about<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.150> just<00:05:45.480> shows

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
argue much about it but that just shows

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.450 
argue much about it but that just shows
us<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:46.050> way<00:05:46.230> that<00:05:46.530> God<00:05:46.740> created<00:05:47.130> human<00:05:47.430> beings

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
us the way that God created human beings

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.790 
us the way that God created human beings
it<00:05:48.120> doesn't<00:05:48.480> deny<00:05:48.600> that<00:05:48.870> God<00:05:49.050> was<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.380> one<00:05:49.530> who

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
it doesn't deny that God was the one who

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.160 
it doesn't deny that God was the one who
was<00:05:50.070> working<00:05:51.000> through<00:05:51.180> that<00:05:51.330> process<00:05:51.390> it

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
was working through that process it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.390 
was working through that process it
seems<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.410> me<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.500> God<00:05:52.680> always<00:05:52.950> works

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
seems to me that God always works

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.910 
seems to me that God always works
through<00:05:53.760> natural<00:05:54.420> processes<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:55.440> produce

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
through natural processes to produce

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.000 
through natural processes to produce
supernatural<00:05:56.880> results
