00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.309
 opinion about him so here's my 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.199
 review I have something to comment on 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.790
 novels in general of john green and all 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.229
 the massive translation that is taking place 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.510
 lately of the novels of john green 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.159
 and the john green boom but before 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.000
 that we are going to talk about the synopsis of 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.640
 this 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.920
 wilmer and they are very cool are going two 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440
 guys that are called will grace on and the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.270
 another boy is called will verizon or god 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.180
 mine what novelty seriously a moment 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.920
 Unexpected plot twist can prove very 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.990
 silly but me when I only knew 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.119
 the title was not sure I wanted 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.950
 mean our first will grace on 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.400
 is a person who is little involved 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.570
 things and what goes through life going on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.310
 basically this is why your best 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.110
 friend tiny cooper is decided on 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 match him with someone because he needs 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.130
 a change in your life and you have catch is a 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 pretty special character the truth in 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.330
 the novel I consider it even more 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.280
 protagonist that wilber and they are because in 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.630
 yes everything revolves around him and is a 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.670
 character that I liked a lot and 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 which we are going to talk about later and by 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.420
 another side we have the other wilber are that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.009
 if the first one is already very little involved 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.190
 this is not implied in anything is a 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.560
 sad person saddened dismal like the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.329
 Museum 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.009
 and the only good thing that he considers he has 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.540
 in life is a person who has 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.790
 found thanks to the internet and that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.560
 called aisac and in part thanks to that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.869
 is why these two will grace jones 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
 collide in the temporary space and they 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.770
 they are leaving behind the subject of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.620
 the signs and if entering more into what is 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.290
 my reflection on the book I would like 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 talk about the boom of john green these 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.730
 are the three novels that I have of john 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.280
 green translated into Spanish is missing 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 looking for alaska and the catherine theorem 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.019
 but honestly I do not think the buy 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.280
 that because there I go because the first book 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.870
 that I actually read a triumph under the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.910
 same star obviously and then 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.049
 obviously I loved it we do not have to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.049
 talk more about this book because 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.380
 the next book I read was cities 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.330
 of paper and the truth is that I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 disappointed enough was not because I was going 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.870
 with the expectations of low the same 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.340
 star but because I did not find him 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.320
 a lot of chicha to the story in fact not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.970
 I'm excited for the movie after 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.860
 I bought a band from soft to phoenix for 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.140
 yong rim because he was from jong and he wanted 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.300
 try it and it looked like everything to 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.600
 paper cities to the point that what 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.310
 I stopped reading and I left it practically at 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.530
 beginning so when I live in places 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.360
 still very gray are I was not too sure of 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.280
 if you really wanted to read it because it's that 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.470
 my problem with joplin is that by removing 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.210
 under the same star I always saw the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.510
 same characters pretty much the same 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.150
 plot the same metaphors in part and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.590
 everything revolving around the same thing and 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.270
 then you will say me luisa and because 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.680
 You took the guy and they are very cool they are 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.870
 for a simple reason because it is 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.300
 written by davis levy are also and the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.680
 truth is that I do not regret anything 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.970
 if you like yong lemon drugs 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 I'm sure you'll like it 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.670
 grace jones but on the contrary if 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200
 you have experienced what I 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.420
 experimented with his novels if you 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.780
 they seem similar parallel themselves 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.130
 same tone characters in everything I think that 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.930
 you might like very funny very cool 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.910
 they are for the freshness that it puts in bill 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.130
 evans or john green stays true to its 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.540
 style there are metaphors and then the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.640
 characters as you could see by the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.890
 description they look like they understand 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.240
 paper cities and the theme guy 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.330
 catherine face I do not remember how it 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.670
 call and we may look similar but 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.900
 this book is very different from the truth 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.520
 another side we also have the other 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.340
 character that leads the piece and 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.110
 how each one takes a chapter the thing 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.340
 it gets much more enjoyable I'm not 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.200
 saying that I do not like how he writes 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.630
 john green for nothing in fact I like 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.550
 very much that what sometimes stresses me 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.250
 a little bit that everything revolves around what 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.810
 same and that's why I liked this book 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.190
 and I thought it was a little more original 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.140
 apart they also introduce us the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.730
 community that the first chapter of the 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.380
 I wrote it, I wrote it green, and the second 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.150
 he writes it from the library and from there 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.730
 they alternate well when I 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.410
 I read the first chapter of David Levy fan 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.300
 that in the book was the second what 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.940
 first what you notice is that there is no 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.560
 a capital all is point and there is no 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.270
 a capital letter and it's written in a 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.200
 pretty interesting way indeed 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.419
 I started writing things like hashtag 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.260
 drama and at the end of the chapter I wanted to 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.730
 put some 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.040
 to remember me in the future and 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.920
 basically what I put was chapter 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.110
 the less confusing 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.330
 as I have clashed with the personality of 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.120
 this other way but wow what of the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.640
 capital letters me in paranoia and the last 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.870
 point is I think I like it so that 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.250
 you see that I had enough feelings 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.720
 contradictory when I started writing 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.360
 of good perform because the other book 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.670
 that I had already read of David Levy Fan not 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.650
 it was like this for nothing in fact this obsession 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.980
 It was very dark, very dark and really 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.200
 that hit me a lot and I started like that 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.900
 that feeling of suspicion and I have finished 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.430
 the book liking to the utmost the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.690
 I really liked the part of 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.000
 live levitan but I also liked 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.440
 quite the part of john green I think that 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.180
 he has brought freshness to this whole subject 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.760
 that has been talking before and about 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.900
 all when describing with another author the thing 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.430
 the truth has improved a lot 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.200
 obviously there is man does not need 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 write with anyone to get good 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.710
 books the truth but to me this book in 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.420
 I liked it special indeed 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.100
 I think it's my second favorite of yong 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.660
 lim because the first one is under the same 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.860
 star obviously but it has been a 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.540
 much more good experience than with 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.830
 paper cities or with anna bands two 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.420
 posters that maybe gave him a 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.190
 opportunity of the future to that last 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.560
 The book also deals with 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.240
 community that and basically because there 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.480
 several characters that are and the truth 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.950
 is that not 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.200
 quite because it's one of the first 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.580
 books that I read that deal with the subject and 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.680
 I want to read more because the truth is that 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.600
 I like them a lot I have a great time and 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.220
 this one has a sarcastic point and 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.770
 humorous not only with the gay community 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.750
 but in general and it's really cool the truth 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.220
 I laugh a lot in many scenes and 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.780
 I have also laughed at the drama 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.360
 that some are promoted or that is me 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.400
 loved the friendship that unites the first 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.770
 wilburys even with sainz and cooper has me 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.140
 delighted and that good job I'm not 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.520
 great and I think it's the issues that 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.410
 I liked the book the friendship 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.770
 how he treats her because there are also issues 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.540
 loving but I've been coaxed 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.430
 theme of friendship in this book is a 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.770
 pretty juvenile and very general book 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.850
 but I love them and they spend a 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.190
 I sigh the truth is that you 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.050
 very fast and I'm reading more or 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.180
 less slow not reading those days or so 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.770
 so it's great, equally, not 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.600
 you need a lot more time to read it 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.910
 because there are no frames too dense nor 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.970
 deep I was between a three and a half and 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.070
 a 4 out of 5 but in the end he gave a 4 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.360
 about 5 in good guys although there is 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.700
 between three and a half and four is a 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.560
 quite high score I must say what 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.540
 The only thing that shocked me a little was the 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.490
 final I expected something 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.860
 much more epic as they went 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.960
 trying in the book you were already 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.540
 waiting in the end and the secrecy that 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.780
 it was being created and suddenly 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.760
 it's over 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.590
 I feel I missed something from that ending and 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.440
 that's why you get the best of four to 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.180
 three and he gave me a little but in general 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.860
 the balance is good so I can not 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.300
 put a negative note just for the 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.980
 final if you have read the book if I 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.020
 you understand with the love-hate problem 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.610
 yong rim or if you want to tell me any 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.070
 thing you already know that you can leave it to me 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.870
 the comments if you want to read the 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.150
 You can also leave me book and if you 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.730
