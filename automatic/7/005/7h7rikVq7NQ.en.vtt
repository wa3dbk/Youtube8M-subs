00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
your right side you don't exercise it

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.419

let's<00:01:23.149> say<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:24.020> your<00:01:24.499> left<00:01:24.799> side<00:01:25.069> you<00:01:25.399> can

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
let's say that on your left side you can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.929 
let's say that on your left side you can
turn<00:01:25.939> 30<00:01:26.749> degrees<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.380> your<00:01:27.799> front<00:01:27.979> leg<00:01:28.249> but<00:01:28.819> on

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
turn 30 degrees on your front leg but on

turn 30 degrees on your front leg but on
your<00:01:29.060> right<00:01:29.270> side<00:01:29.569> you<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:30.020> only<00:01:30.170> turn<00:01:30.469> 15

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
your right side you can only turn 15

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.239 
your right side you can only turn 15
degrees<00:01:31.549> on<00:01:31.819> your<00:01:31.969> front<00:01:32.179> leg<00:01:32.799> then<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.979> only

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
degrees on your front leg then you only

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.859 
degrees on your front leg then you only
turn<00:01:34.689> 15<00:01:35.689> degrees<00:01:36.109> on<00:01:36.349> both<00:01:36.380> sides<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.630> I'll

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
turn 15 degrees on both sides and I'll

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.679 
turn 15 degrees on both sides and I'll
go<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.229> step<00:01:39.529> further<00:01:39.799> than<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.369> if<00:01:41.209> you<00:01:41.479> can

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
go one step further than that if you can

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.469 
go one step further than that if you can
only<00:01:41.840> turn<00:01:42.349> 15<00:01:42.979> degrees<00:01:43.459> on<00:01:43.700> your<00:01:43.849> right<00:01:44.090> side

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
only turn 15 degrees on your right side

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.859 
only turn 15 degrees on your right side
you<00:01:45.170> only<00:01:45.349> turn<00:01:45.740> 10<00:01:46.249> degrees<00:01:46.789> on<00:01:47.060> both<00:01:47.479> sides

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
you only turn 10 degrees on both sides

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.809 
you only turn 10 degrees on both sides
because<00:01:48.439> now<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.799> 10<00:01:49.340> degrees<00:01:49.819> is<00:01:50.319> two-thirds

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
because now the 10 degrees is two-thirds

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.300 
because now the 10 degrees is two-thirds
70%<00:01:52.819> of<00:01:52.999> your<00:01:53.179> capacity<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.169> that<00:01:54.740> means<00:01:55.099> you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
70% of your capacity and that means you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.690 
70% of your capacity and that means you
never<00:01:55.490> hit<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.880> bite<00:01:56.179> point<00:01:57.310> no<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.490> bite

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
never hit the bite point no the bite

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.569 
never hit the bite point no the bite
point<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.329> when<00:01:59.659> your<00:01:59.810> body<00:02:00.020> goes<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.829> your

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
point is when your body goes and your

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
hundred-percent that's like yes if I was

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
hundred-percent that's like yes if I was
to<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.110> side<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.890> turn<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
to do it on this side I can turn to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
to do it on this side I can turn to
there<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.970> start<00:02:17.270> feeling<00:02:17.300> stretches

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
there and I start feeling stretches

that<00:02:27.950> side<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:30.020> if<00:02:30.440> that's<00:02:31.240> there<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.600> me<00:02:34.000> here

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
that side so if that's there for me here

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.750 
that side so if that's there for me here
I<00:02:35.209> still<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.630> stretch<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.310> haven't<00:02:37.520> hit

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
I still have stretch but I haven't hit

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.630 
I still have stretch but I haven't hit
that<00:02:37.940> bite<00:02:38.180> point<00:02:41.800> absolutely<00:02:42.800> well<00:02:43.100> if

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that bite point absolutely well if

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.090 
that bite point absolutely well if
there's<00:02:44.270> if<00:02:44.630> there's<00:02:45.020> no<00:02:45.260> stretch<00:02:45.650> you're<00:02:45.920> not

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
there's if there's no stretch you're not

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.699 
there's if there's no stretch you're not
a<00:02:46.130> 70<00:02:46.550> percent<00:02:46.670> you're<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.630> fifty<00:02:48.170> percent<00:02:48.319> or

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
a 70 percent you're a fifty percent or

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.850 
a 70 percent you're a fifty percent or
less<00:02:50.200> okay<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:52.480> let's<00:02:53.480> let's<00:02:54.080> really<00:02:54.410> look<00:02:54.530> at

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
less okay and let's let's really look at

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.900 
less okay and let's let's really look at
this<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.870> let's<00:02:56.870> say<00:02:57.080> 15<00:02:57.650> degrees<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
this now let's say 15 degrees and you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.090 
this now let's say 15 degrees and you
hit<00:02:59.090> your<00:02:59.239> bite<00:02:59.480> point<00:03:03.550> 10<00:03:04.550> degrees<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.890> may

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
hit your bite point 10 degrees you may

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.930 
hit your bite point 10 degrees you may
have<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.670> little<00:03:08.209> bit<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.450> stretch<00:03:09.489> 11<00:03:10.489> degrees

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
have a little bit of stretch 11 degrees

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210 
have a little bit of stretch 11 degrees
that<00:03:11.239> stretch<00:03:11.780> intensity<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.650> starting<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.100> go

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
that stretch intensity is starting to go

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.930 
that stretch intensity is starting to go
up<00:03:13.480> quickly<00:03:14.480> at<00:03:15.170> 12<00:03:15.709> degrees<00:03:15.980> you're<00:03:16.519> really

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
up quickly at 12 degrees you're really

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.900 
up quickly at 12 degrees you're really
starting<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.390> push<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.840> body<00:03:18.489> 15<00:03:19.489> degrees

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
starting to push the body 15 degrees

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.430 
starting to push the body 15 degrees
it's<00:03:20.180> like<00:03:20.360> if<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.569> go<00:03:20.720> more<00:03:20.900> than<00:03:20.930> 15<00:03:21.080> degrees

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
it's like if you go more than 15 degrees

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.199 
it's like if you go more than 15 degrees
you're<00:03:21.769> going<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.010> cause<00:03:22.190> damage<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.910> your

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
you're going to cause damage to your

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.789 
you're going to cause damage to your
system<00:03:24.370> yes<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.430> 10<00:03:28.430> 11<00:03:29.180> degrees<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:30.350> turn

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
system yes so this 10 11 degrees of turn

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.870 
system yes so this 10 11 degrees of turn
is<00:03:32.380> exactly<00:03:33.380> where<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.799> want<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.190> be<00:03:34.310> stopping

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
is exactly where you want to be stopping

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.750 
is exactly where you want to be stopping
and<00:03:35.390> not<00:03:36.110> going<00:03:36.530> into<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.160> really<00:03:37.370> strong

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
and not going into the really strong

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.710 
and not going into the really strong
stretching<00:03:39.459> because<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.820> 10<00:03:41.209> 11

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
stretching because it's that 10 11

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.310 
stretching because it's that 10 11
degrees<00:03:42.350> you're<00:03:43.299> 70%<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.480> 15<00:03:45.549> yes<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:47.109> when<00:03:48.109> you

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
degrees you're 70% of 15 yes is when you

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.180 
degrees you're 70% of 15 yes is when you
really<00:03:49.250> start<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:50.000> get<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.900> nerves<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.530> let<00:03:51.890> go

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
really start to get the nerves to let go

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.349 
really start to get the nerves to let go
and<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.670> go<00:03:52.850> beyond<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.500> 11<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:56.180> is

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
and when you go beyond that 11 this is

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.640 
and when you go beyond that 11 this is
what's<00:03:56.570> starting<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.930> happen<00:03:57.019> in<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.410> nervous

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
what's starting to happen in the nervous

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.680 
what's starting to happen in the nervous
system<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:58.280> protect<00:03:58.519> your<00:03:58.940> body<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:02.329> want<00:04:02.570> it
