the cat has to go into then make sure

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.529 
the cat has to go into then make sure
you<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:49.950> lids<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.030> hamster<00:00:51.360> cages<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.150 

wouldn't<00:00:57.539> recommend<00:00:57.899> letting<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.770> hamster

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
wouldn't recommend letting your hamster

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
wouldn't recommend letting your hamster
and<00:00:59.309> cat<00:00:59.520> sniff<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.420> trying<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and cat sniff are you trying to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
and cat sniff are you trying to
introduce<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.620> cat<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> hamster<00:01:02.460> together

introduce your cat and hamster together

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.359 
introduce your cat and hamster together
because<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> most<00:01:03.600> likely<00:01:03.930> won't<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:05.040> anything

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because it most likely won't do anything

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.850 
because it most likely won't do anything
your<00:01:05.909> cat<00:01:06.119> might<00:01:06.510> even<00:01:06.960> try<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> even

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
your cat might even try to get it even

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
your cat might even try to get it even
more<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> they've<00:01:08.820> smelled<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
more now that they've smelled it and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
more now that they've smelled it and
know<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.900> also<00:01:13.049> very

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
know about it and it's also very

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
know about it and it's also very
stressful<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> hamster<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> sniffed

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
stressful for the hamster to be sniffed

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
stressful for the hamster to be sniffed
by<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> its<00:01:17.070> predators<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.750> even<00:01:19.020> own

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
