hey<00:00:02.639> what's<00:00:02.970> up<00:00:03.149> Andrew<00:00:03.600> Kramer<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.290> and

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hey what's up Andrew Kramer here and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.170 
hey what's up Andrew Kramer here and
today<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.400> take<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> look<00:00:05.790> at<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
today we're going to take a look at the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.530 
today we're going to take a look at the
element<00:00:06.660> 3d<00:00:07.049> render<00:00:07.500> engine<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.179> is

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
element 3d render engine so what it is

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.049 
element 3d render engine so what it is
is<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:09.990> OpenGL<00:00:10.410> based<00:00:10.980> renderer<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.910> was

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
is an OpenGL based renderer that was

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.930 
is an OpenGL based renderer that was
specifically<00:00:12.750> designed<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.530> element<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
specifically designed for element and it

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120 
specifically designed for element and it
was<00:00:15.030> designed<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.690> fast<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.500> looked

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
was designed to be fast and looked

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.090 
was designed to be fast and looked
really<00:00:17.609> good<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.420> let's<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> look<00:00:19.619> at<00:00:19.800> some

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
really good so let's take a look at some

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
really good so let's take a look at some
of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> different<00:00:20.670> features<00:00:21.230> first<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.380> all

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of the different features first of all

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
of the different features first of all
it<00:00:22.800> works<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.640> After<00:00:24.119> Effects<00:00:24.480> lighting<00:00:25.140> so

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
it works with After Effects lighting so

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
it works with After Effects lighting so
we<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> actually<00:00:26.099> move<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.699> lights<00:00:26.910> around

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
we can actually move the lights around

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.169 
we can actually move the lights around
and<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.830> some<00:00:28.980> instant<00:00:29.460> interactive

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and you can get some instant interactive

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
and you can get some instant interactive
feedback<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.949> great<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.189> you're<00:00:32.369> trying

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
feedback so it's great if you're trying

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.010 
feedback so it's great if you're trying
to<00:00:32.640> match<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.180> lighting<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.750> say<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to match the lighting of say the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.560 
to match the lighting of say the
background<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.460> exactly<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.390> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
background you can see exactly what it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
background you can see exactly what it's
looking<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.950> move<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.489> lights

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
looking like as you move the lights

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.740 
looking like as you move the lights
it<00:00:39.690> also<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:40.200> real<00:00:40.590> 3d<00:00:41.280> motion<00:00:41.850> blur<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it also has real 3d motion blur so if I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
it also has real 3d motion blur so if I
turn<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> motion<00:00:43.500> blur<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> comp<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
turn the motion blur on for the comp you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.819 
turn the motion blur on for the comp you
can<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.020> real<00:00:46.260> 3d<00:00:46.649> motion

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
can see that we get some real 3d motion

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
can see that we get some real 3d motion
blur<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.390> responsive<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
blur and it's very responsive so the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
blur and it's very responsive so the
speed<00:00:49.950> doesn't<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.789> slowed<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.780> much

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
speed doesn't get slowed down that much

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
speed doesn't get slowed down that much
by<00:00:52.680> turning<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.579> another<00:00:54.300> thing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
by turning it on now another thing

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
by turning it on now another thing
you'll<00:00:54.719> notice<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.829> element<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.699> handle

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you'll notice is that element can handle

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
you'll notice is that element can handle
some<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.539> high<00:00:57.870> quality<00:00:57.980> models<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
some pretty high quality models this is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
some pretty high quality models this is
a<00:00:59.640> hundred<00:00:59.969> thousand<00:01:00.510> polygons<00:01:00.989> model<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a hundred thousand polygons model and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
a hundred thousand polygons model and
it's<00:01:02.340> looking<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.600> 4k

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it's looking really good it has 4k

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.890 
it's looking really good it has 4k
textures<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.119> impressive<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
textures so it's pretty impressive and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.330 
textures so it's pretty impressive and
it<00:01:07.049> doesn't<00:01:07.290> seem<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.650> slowing<00:01:07.830> things

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it doesn't seem to be slowing things

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.260 
it doesn't seem to be slowing things
down<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.960> we'll<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.470> hit<00:01:10.650> OK<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
down a bit so we'll go and hit OK and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
down a bit so we'll go and hit OK and
let's<00:01:12.270> jump<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.869> another<00:01:13.400> example<00:01:14.400> another

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
let's jump into another example another

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840 
let's jump into another example another
great<00:01:15.240> feature<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> 3d<00:01:16.530> fog<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.729> go

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
great feature is the 3d fog so if we go

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
great feature is the 3d fog so if we go
to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> render<00:01:18.330> settings<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.740> turn<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to the render settings we can turn the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.910 
to the render settings we can turn the
fog<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> adjust<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.710> distance

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
fog on and we can adjust the distance

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.820 
fog on and we can adjust the distance
the<00:01:23.790> fog<00:01:24.090> starts<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.320> set<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the fog starts and we can also set the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
the fog starts and we can also set the
range<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.759> how<00:01:26.880> far<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> fog<00:01:27.630> goes<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.680> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
range for how far the fog goes you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
range for how far the fog goes you can
control<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> color<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.329> some<00:01:30.509> really

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
control the color and do some really

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
control the color and do some really
cool<00:01:30.930> stuff<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.920> great<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.130> motion

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
cool stuff so it's great for motion

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.550 
cool stuff so it's great for motion
graphics<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.299> also<00:01:33.420> great<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.960> making

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
graphics but it's also great for making

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
graphics but it's also great for making
things<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.520> off<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
things look like they go off into the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.410 
things look like they go off into the
distance<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:37.530> another<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.820> important

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
distance now another really important

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.230 
distance now another really important
feature<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.930> depth<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.950> field<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.460> we'll<00:01:42.150> go

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
feature is depth of field so we'll go

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
feature is depth of field so we'll go
and<00:01:42.390> turn<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.490> thing<00:01:44.640> about

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and turn that on now the one thing about

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.910 
and turn that on now the one thing about
depth<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.240> field<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> does<00:01:46.590> slow

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
depth of field is that it does slow

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
depth of field is that it does slow
things<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.780> most

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
things down a little bit but in most

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
things down a little bit but in most
cases<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> turn<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.520> end

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
cases you want to turn it on at the end

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
cases you want to turn it on at the end
when<00:01:51.420> you're<00:01:51.509> ready<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:52.020> render<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.009> cool

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
when you're ready to render but the cool

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
when you're ready to render but the cool
thing<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.270> interacts<00:01:54.720> with

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
thing is that it actually interacts with

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
thing is that it actually interacts with
the<00:01:55.110> focus<00:01:55.470> distance<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.549> camera<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the focus distance of the camera so you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
the focus distance of the camera so you
can<00:01:57.240> control<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.649> by<00:01:58.770> changing<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
can control it just by changing the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
can control it just by changing the
camera<00:01:59.820> settings<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.079> nice<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
camera settings the other nice thing is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
camera settings the other nice thing is
that<00:02:01.710> we've<00:02:01.920> actually<00:02:02.130> built<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.939> couple<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that we've actually built in a couple of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.780 
that we've actually built in a couple of
different<00:02:03.780> depth<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.200> field<00:02:04.380> modes<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.700> we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
different depth of field modes so if we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.880 
different depth of field modes so if we
go<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> pixel<00:02:07.710> blur

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
go in there we can see the pixel blur

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
go in there we can see the pixel blur
and<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> multipass<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.780> bit

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and the multipass are a little bit

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 
and the multipass are a little bit
slower<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.920> they<00:02:11.039> look<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> most<00:02:11.640> accurate

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
slower but they look the most accurate

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
slower but they look the most accurate
and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.900> also<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> pre

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and then we also have the pre

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
and then we also have the pre
you<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.580> continuous<00:02:15.180> blur<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.630> are<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you and the continuous blur which are a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.010 
you and the continuous blur which are a
lot<00:02:16.440> faster<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.880> accurate<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
lot faster but not as accurate so you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
lot faster but not as accurate so you
can<00:02:19.170> use<00:02:19.350> those<00:02:19.620> while<00:02:19.830> you're<00:02:19.860> previewing

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
can use those while you're previewing

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
can use those while you're previewing
and<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> sense<00:02:21.210> for<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> depth

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and just get a sense for what the depth

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.590 
and just get a sense for what the depth
of<00:02:22.260> field<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.710> going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.520> let<00:02:24.510> me

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
of field is going to look like let me

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.660 
of field is going to look like let me
show<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> another<00:02:24.960> great<00:02:25.380> feature<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.160> here

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
show you another great feature so here

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.430 
show you another great feature so here
we<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.090> chess<00:02:27.450> set<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.260> looks

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
we have this chess set and it looks

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.530 
we have this chess set and it looks
pretty<00:02:28.680> good<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> shading<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.210> really

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
pretty good but the shading is really

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080 
pretty good but the shading is really
flat<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.200> let<00:02:31.710> me<00:02:31.800> add<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.190> into<00:02:32.490> our<00:02:32.610> scene<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
flat so let me add it into our scene and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850 
flat so let me add it into our scene and
we'll<00:02:33.600> come<00:02:33.810> down<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> render<00:02:34.560> settings

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
we'll come down to the render settings

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.760 
we'll come down to the render settings
and<00:02:35.220> you'll<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:35.910> ambient<00:02:36.510> occlusion

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
and you'll see we have ambient occlusion

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.370 
and you'll see we have ambient occlusion
built-in<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.430> we'll<00:02:38.730> open<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.480> we'll

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
built-in so we'll open that up and we'll

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.070 
built-in so we'll open that up and we'll
turn<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.210> see<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:42.510> instantly

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
turn it on and you can see we instantly

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.380 
turn it on and you can see we instantly
get<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> more<00:02:43.590> realistic<00:02:44.070> look<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.270> can

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
get a more realistic look and you can

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.670 
get a more realistic look and you can
see<00:02:45.540> we're<00:02:45.720> still<00:02:45.750> getting<00:02:46.140> amazing

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
see we're still getting amazing

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860 
see we're still getting amazing
performance<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.420> really<00:02:48.630> great

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
performance so this is a really great

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
performance so this is a really great
look<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.410> make<00:02:49.560> things<00:02:49.800> look<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.160> lot<00:02:50.460> less<00:02:50.730> like

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
look to make things look a lot less like

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.860 
look to make things look a lot less like
the<00:02:51.200> 1990s<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.430> control<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.120> radius<00:02:54.600> here

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the 1990s we can control the radius here

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240 
the 1990s we can control the radius here
so<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.320> make<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.070> really

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so we can make it you know like really

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.090 
so we can make it you know like really
tight<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:56.880> really<00:02:57.660> soft<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:58.980> also

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
tight or really soft and we can also

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.760 
tight or really soft and we can also
control<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.820> intensity<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.750> really<00:03:01.590> cool

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
control the intensity so really cool

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.500 
control the intensity so really cool
feature<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.340> making<00:03:02.640> things<00:03:02.910> look<00:03:03.270> good

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
feature for making things look good

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.440 
feature for making things look good
without<00:03:04.080> slowing<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.040> down<00:03:05.180> now

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
without slowing you down now

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.510 
without slowing you down now
while<00:03:06.930> we're<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.560> project<00:03:07.860> let<00:03:08.250> me<00:03:08.310> show

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
while we're in this project let me show

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.180 
while we're in this project let me show
you<00:03:08.580> something<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.240> lighting<00:03:09.900> tab<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.890> if

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
you something in the lighting tab so if

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
you something in the lighting tab so if
you<00:03:11.430> look<00:03:11.580> at<00:03:11.670> my<00:03:11.760> project<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.300> don't<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.540> any

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
you look at my project I don't have any

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
you look at my project I don't have any
lights<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> scene<00:03:13.590> but<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> do<00:03:14.700> have

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
lights in the scene but what I do have

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.210 
lights in the scene but what I do have
is<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.390> additional<00:03:15.780> lighting<00:03:16.500> option<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
is this additional lighting option and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
is this additional lighting option and
this<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> great<00:03:18.060> way<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.240> experiment<00:03:18.750> with

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
this is a great way to experiment with

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.050 
this is a great way to experiment with
different<00:03:19.320> lighting<00:03:19.860> setups<00:03:20.250> without<00:03:20.760> having

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
different lighting setups without having

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.540 
different lighting setups without having
to<00:03:21.150> add<00:03:21.270> them<00:03:21.510> all<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.870> manually<00:03:22.410> yourself<00:03:22.560> but

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
to add them all in manually yourself but

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.400 
to add them all in manually yourself but
what's<00:03:24.030> great<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:24.840> actually<00:03:25.050> add

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
what's great is you can actually add

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.340 
what's great is you can actually add
additional<00:03:26.250> lights<00:03:26.520> on<00:03:26.760> top<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.959> can

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
additional lights on top of it so I can

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.490 
additional lights on top of it so I can
say<00:03:28.560> add<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> spotlight<00:03:29.580> here<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.350> let's<00:03:31.350> see

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
say add a spotlight here and let's see

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.150 
say add a spotlight here and let's see
it<00:03:31.590> up<00:03:32.100> here<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.880> we'll<00:03:33.000> hit<00:03:33.060> OK<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:34.160> we'll

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
it up here and we'll hit OK and we'll

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.480 
it up here and we'll hit OK and we'll
move<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.580> closer<00:03:35.880> into<00:03:36.360> our<00:03:36.480> scene<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.490> you

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
move it closer into our scene and you

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.740 
move it closer into our scene and you
can<00:03:38.640> see<00:03:38.820> we're<00:03:39.060> getting<00:03:39.270> some<00:03:39.420> great

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
can see we're getting some great

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.140 
can see we're getting some great
responsiveness<00:03:40.560> from<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.520> additional

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
responsiveness from this additional

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.880 
responsiveness from this additional
lighting<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.110> great<00:03:43.320> for<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.590> putting

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
lighting so it's great for just putting

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.550 
lighting so it's great for just putting
those<00:03:44.010> final<00:03:44.520> touches<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:45.120> your<00:03:45.810> shot<00:03:46.200> now

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
those final touches on your shot now

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.550 
those final touches on your shot now
while<00:03:47.430> we're<00:03:47.580> in<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.000> project<00:03:48.350> let<00:03:49.350> me<00:03:49.410> show

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
while we're in this project let me show

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.740 
while we're in this project let me show
you<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.709> couple<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.070> other<00:03:50.310> rendering<00:03:50.700> modes<00:03:51.420> so

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you a couple of other rendering modes so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.840 
you a couple of other rendering modes so
if<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.170> output<00:03:52.620> here<00:03:52.950> we<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.820> a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
if we go to the output here we have a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.340 
if we go to the output here we have a
couple<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.240> polygons<00:03:54.720> mode<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.080> right<00:03:55.230> now

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
couple of polygons mode so right now

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590 
couple of polygons mode so right now
we're<00:03:55.560> looking<00:03:55.590> at<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.070> polygons<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:56.850> we<00:03:57.450> can

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
we're looking at the polygons but we can

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050 
we're looking at the polygons but we can
switch<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.200> wireframe<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
switch this to wireframe and this is a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
switch this to wireframe and this is a
great<00:04:00.270> way<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.780> see<00:04:00.959> some<00:04:01.230> different<00:04:01.590> you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
great way to just see some different you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.350 
great way to just see some different you
know<00:04:01.800> abstract<00:04:02.430> looks<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.240> motion

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
know abstract looks you know for motion

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.020 
know abstract looks you know for motion
graphics<00:04:04.050> we<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:04.709> also<00:04:04.860> switch<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.459> point

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
graphics we can also switch it to point

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.470 
graphics we can also switch it to point
cloud<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:07.080> see<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> bunch<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.770> dots<00:04:08.480> alright

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
cloud to see a bunch of dots alright

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
cloud to see a bunch of dots alright
let's<00:04:09.690> take<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.900> look<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.230> some<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
let's take a look at some of the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.670 
let's take a look at some of the
multipass<00:04:11.130> output<00:04:11.880> modes<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.690> here<00:04:13.380> we<00:04:13.470> have

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
multipass output modes so here we have

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.039 
multipass output modes so here we have
this<00:04:13.890> missile<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:15.270> want<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.540> add<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> glow

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
this missile and we want to add a glow

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.860 
this missile and we want to add a glow
specifically<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.280> afterburn<00:04:17.880> area<00:04:18.299> but

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
specifically to the afterburn area but

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.680 
specifically to the afterburn area but
if<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.410> were<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.560> say<00:04:19.770> add<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.010> glow<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.669> top<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.570> my

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
if I were to say add a glow on top of my

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.690 
if I were to say add a glow on top of my
project<00:04:22.320> well<00:04:22.590> what<00:04:22.919> would<00:04:22.979> happen<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
project well what would happen is the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.450 
project well what would happen is the
glow<00:04:24.210> would<00:04:24.419> come<00:04:24.630> out<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.990> everywhere<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.890> we

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
glow would come out of everywhere so we

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.720 
glow would come out of everywhere so we
want

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
want

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.150 
want
be<00:04:26.790> able<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.060> isolate<00:04:27.290> just<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.530> afterburn

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
be able to isolate just that afterburn

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.780 
be able to isolate just that afterburn
area

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
area

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.600 
area
well<00:04:30.090> element<00:04:31.080> has<00:04:31.350> some<00:04:31.590> great<00:04:31.860> features<00:04:32.190> for

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
well element has some great features for

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.940 
well element has some great features for
doing<00:04:33.180> just<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.050> here's<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.740> base

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
doing just that so here's the base

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.210 
doing just that so here's the base
project<00:04:35.310> here<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:36.330> our<00:04:36.600> missile<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.320> again

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
project here with our missile and again

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.240 
project here with our missile and again
you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.520> see<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:39.330> renders<00:04:39.720> quite<00:04:40.110> fast<00:04:40.620> so

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
you can see it renders quite fast so

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010 
you can see it renders quite fast so
here<00:04:41.550> we<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:41.790> our<00:04:41.910> base<00:04:42.210> scene<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.870> can

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
here we have our base scene and you can

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.110 
here we have our base scene and you can
see<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.680> everything<00:04:44.130> still<00:04:44.400> renders<00:04:44.790> quite

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
see that everything still renders quite

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.210 
see that everything still renders quite
fast<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.810> what<00:04:46.410> we<00:04:46.500> can<00:04:46.650> do<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.830> come<00:04:47.010> over<00:04:47.040> to

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
fast and what we can do is come over to

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.730 
fast and what we can do is come over to
element<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:47.850> in<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.660> output<00:04:48.840> tab<00:04:49.290> we<00:04:49.590> can

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
element and in the output tab we can

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.800 
element and in the output tab we can
change<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.220> from<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.430> composite<00:04:51.210> to

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
change it from the composite to

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.050 
change it from the composite to
illumination<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.860> what<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.640> does<00:04:53.850> is

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
illumination and what that does is

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.390 
illumination and what that does is
creates<00:04:54.450> an<00:04:54.600> output<00:04:55.040> specifically<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:56.280> that

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
creates an output specifically for that

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360 
creates an output specifically for that
area<00:04:56.730> so<00:04:57.390> here's<00:04:57.960> what<00:04:58.140> we<00:04:58.230> can<00:04:58.380> do<00:04:58.530> we<00:04:59.340> can

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
area so here's what we can do we can

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.790 
area so here's what we can do we can
duplicate<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.450> element<00:05:00.870> layer<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:01.590> we'll

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
duplicate the element layer so we'll

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.010 
duplicate the element layer so we'll
choose<00:05:01.980> duplicate<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:02.760> then<00:05:03.630> we'll<00:05:03.780> set<00:05:03.990> the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
choose duplicate and then we'll set the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.800 
choose duplicate and then we'll set the
output<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.890> copy<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:06.030> illumination<00:05:06.510> and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
output of the copy to illumination and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.320 
output of the copy to illumination and
then<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.650> can<00:05:07.770> add<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:07.920> glow<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.670> specific

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
then we can add a glow to that specific

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.130 
then we can add a glow to that specific
area<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:09.960> if<00:05:10.020> we<00:05:10.080> choose<00:05:10.430> stylize<00:05:11.430> glow<00:05:12.210> you

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
area so if we choose stylize glow you

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.110 
area so if we choose stylize glow you
can<00:05:13.320> turn<00:05:13.620> this<00:05:13.890> up<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.340> little<00:05:14.550> bit<00:05:14.850> maybe

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
can turn this up a little bit maybe

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.240 
can turn this up a little bit maybe
change<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.960> color<00:05:18.020> see<00:05:19.020> here<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:22.250> what's

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
change the color see here and what's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.560 
change the color see here and what's
great<00:05:23.400> is<00:05:23.640> we<00:05:23.760> can<00:05:23.910> add<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.300> glow

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
great is we can add the glow

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.960 
great is we can add the glow
specifically<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:25.920> part<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.550> image

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
specifically to this part of the image

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.510 
specifically to this part of the image
and<00:05:27.360> then<00:05:27.870> we<00:05:27.990> can<00:05:28.140> composite<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.800> back<00:05:28.980> on<00:05:29.220> top

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
and then we can composite it back on top

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.700 
and then we can composite it back on top
by<00:05:29.760> changing<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> transfer<00:05:30.750> mode<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.050> add<00:05:31.200> and

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
by changing the transfer mode to add and

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.150 
by changing the transfer mode to add and
we<00:05:32.610> can<00:05:32.730> unsolo<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.990> then<00:05:34.740> we<00:05:34.800> can<00:05:34.830> just

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
we can unsolo that and then we can just

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.830 
we can unsolo that and then we can just
increase<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.880> intensity<00:05:36.450> of<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.630> glow

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
increase the intensity of the glow

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.170 
increase the intensity of the glow
change<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.470> radius<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.100> it's<00:05:38.790> looking

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
change the radius and it's looking

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.060 
change the radius and it's looking
really<00:05:39.330> nice<00:05:39.960> let<00:05:40.590> me<00:05:40.680> show<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:40.890> another

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
really nice let me show you another

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.370 
really nice let me show you another
amazing<00:05:41.730> feature<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.600> we're<00:05:43.020> going<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.170> jump

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
amazing feature so we're going to jump

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.920 
amazing feature so we're going to jump
back<00:05:43.440> over<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.950> helicopter<00:05:44.180> project<00:05:45.180> now

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
back over to the helicopter project now

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.810 
back over to the helicopter project now
I<00:05:45.960> just<00:05:46.320> showed<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.590> we<00:05:47.160> can<00:05:47.310> change<00:05:47.610> the

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
I just showed you we can change the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.760 
I just showed you we can change the
output<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.660> any<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.170> different<00:05:49.500> channels

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
output to any of the different channels

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.340 
output to any of the different channels
so<00:05:50.070> we<00:05:50.100> could<00:05:50.280> look<00:05:50.370> at<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.550> Z<00:05:50.790> Pass<00:05:51.090> we<00:05:52.050> can<00:05:52.230> look

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
so we could look at a Z Pass we can look

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.410 
so we could look at a Z Pass we can look
at<00:05:52.470> just<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.040> reflection<00:05:53.280> paths<00:05:54.060> and

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
at just the reflection paths and

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.720 
at just the reflection paths and
composite<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.170> with<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.890> know<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.040> blur<00:05:56.400> or

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
composite that with you know a blur or

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.850 
composite that with you know a blur or
some<00:05:57.000> other<00:05:57.120> effect<00:05:57.510> but<00:05:58.170> what<00:05:58.620> I'm<00:05:58.710> going<00:05:58.830> to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
some other effect but what I'm going to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.100 
some other effect but what I'm going to
do<00:05:58.980> is<00:05:59.190> just<00:05:59.370> leave<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.730> on<00:05:59.790> composite<00:06:00.180> because

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
do is just leave it on composite because

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.440 
do is just leave it on composite because
what<00:06:01.530> we<00:06:01.680> have<00:06:01.860> built<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.460> is<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:02.700> multi<00:06:03.180> pass

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
what we have built in is a multi pass

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.020 
what we have built in is a multi pass
mixer<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.530> what<00:06:04.980> this<00:06:05.100> allows<00:06:05.400> you<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.700> do<00:06:05.850> is

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
mixer and what this allows you to do is

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.180 
mixer and what this allows you to do is
dynamically<00:06:06.720> mix<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.470> different<00:06:07.890> channels

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
dynamically mix the different channels

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.430 
dynamically mix the different channels
together<00:06:08.790> so<00:06:09.240> we<00:06:09.540> can<00:06:09.720> increase<00:06:10.080> the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
together so we can increase the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.710 
together so we can increase the
reflectivity<00:06:11.040> of<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.880> windows<00:06:12.270> or<00:06:12.450> we<00:06:12.570> could

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
reflectivity of the windows or we could

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.380 
reflectivity of the windows or we could
turn<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.190> specular<00:06:14.190> amount<00:06:14.610> up<00:06:14.820> all<00:06:15.120> by

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
turn the specular amount up all by

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.110 
turn the specular amount up all by
itself<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.080> maybe<00:06:16.260> turn<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.920> diffuse<00:06:17.790> down

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
itself and maybe turn the diffuse down

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.270 
itself and maybe turn the diffuse down
so<00:06:18.480> it's<00:06:18.900> great<00:06:19.200> for<00:06:19.230> getting<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.740> final

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
so it's great for getting that final

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.250 
so it's great for getting that final
tweak<00:06:20.610> without<00:06:21.210> having<00:06:21.510> to<00:06:21.570> go<00:06:21.720> into<00:06:21.930> all<00:06:22.230> of

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
tweak without having to go into all of

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.250 
tweak without having to go into all of
your<00:06:22.440> shaders<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.250> adjust<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:23.970> materials<00:06:24.540> we

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
your shaders and adjust the materials we

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.960 
your shaders and adjust the materials we
give<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:25.500> access<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.950> all<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.490> stuff<00:06:26.760> in<00:06:26.940> one

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
give you access to all that stuff in one

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.910 
give you access to all that stuff in one
place<00:06:27.450> so<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.020> can<00:06:28.260> make<00:06:28.410> your<00:06:28.530> composite

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
place so you can make your composite

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.290 
place so you can make your composite
look<00:06:29.610> perfect

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
look perfect

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.840 
look perfect
