00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I think the sounds on this thing are

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
I think the sounds on this thing are
beefier<00:00:57.570> lower<00:00:58.020> frequencies<00:00:58.890> higher

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
beefier lower frequencies higher

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
beefier lower frequencies higher
frequencies<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.510> effects<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
frequencies more effects on some of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
frequencies more effects on some of

track and I'm just into it I feel like a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
track and I'm just into it I feel like a
lot<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> producers<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.750> throw<00:01:24.990> four<00:01:25.380> beats<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

lot of producers can throw four beats on
the<00:01:25.920> floor<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:27.060> cool<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:29.159> rarely

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the floor that's cool but very rarely

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.999 
the floor that's cool but very rarely
does<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.270> feel<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.079> grooves<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
does it actually feel like it grooves to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
does it actually feel like it grooves to
me<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.750> that's<00:01:33.750> how<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> feel<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> album

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
me and that's how I feel with this album

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.620 
me and that's how I feel with this album
though<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.210> mostly<00:01:36.479> because

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
though and I think it's mostly because

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
though and I think it's mostly because
there's<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> attention<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> detail<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
there's a lot of attention to detail on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
there's a lot of attention to detail on
this<00:01:39.180> thing<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.720> little<00:01:39.990> rhythmic

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
this thing these little rhythmic

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
this thing these little rhythmic
flourishes<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> surround<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.570> beats

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
flourishes that surround the beats

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
flourishes that surround the beats
especially<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> opening<00:01:44.220> track<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
especially on the opening track it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
especially on the opening track it
actually<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> reminds<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.490> listening

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
actually kind of reminds me of listening

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
actually kind of reminds me of listening
to<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:48.000> tetes<00:01:48.270> latest<00:01:48.689> LP<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.320> lovin<00:01:49.799> you

subtle subtle embellishments that

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.889 
subtle subtle embellishments that
surround<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> rhythms<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.759> surround<00:02:00.509> the

happen<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.439> slowly<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.680> subtly<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:20.359> really

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
happen so slowly and subtly it really

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.899 
happen so slowly and subtly it really
holds<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:21.829> attention<00:02:21.859> because<00:02:22.639> I'm<00:02:22.760> just

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
holds my attention because I'm just

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.390 
holds my attention because I'm just
really<00:02:23.480> locked<00:02:23.810> into<00:02:24.170> observing<00:02:25.129> what's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
really locked into observing what's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.399 
really locked into observing what's
going<00:02:25.519> on<00:02:26.269> here<00:02:26.569> it's<00:02:26.689> kind<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:26.989> like<00:02:27.139> putting

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
going on here it's kind of like putting

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.369 
going on here it's kind of like putting
life<00:02:27.709> into<00:02:28.069> slow<00:02:28.370> motion<00:02:28.689> while<00:02:29.689> still<00:02:30.230> being

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
life into slow motion while still being

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.490 
life into slow motion while still being
able<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.769> think<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.400> real-time<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.930> kind<00:02:33.439> of

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
able to think in real-time it's kind of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.309 
able to think in real-time it's kind of
weird<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.980> me<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.489> album<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:35.120> equal<00:02:35.989> parts

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.059 
weird to me this album is equal parts
mesmerizing<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.450> engaging<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.079> I<00:02:39.409> I<00:02:39.439> think<00:02:39.650> my

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
mesmerizing and engaging so I I think my

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.979 
mesmerizing and engaging so I I think my
explanation<00:02:40.819> as<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.000> why<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.719> album

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
explanation as to why I like this album

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.199 
explanation as to why I like this album
is<00:02:42.379> is<00:02:42.650> pretty<00:02:42.919> simple<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.639> it<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.819> only<00:02:44.030> be

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
is is pretty simple and it can only be

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.979 
is is pretty simple and it can only be
simple<00:02:44.870> because<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:46.099> is<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> pretty

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
simple because this is a pretty

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.020 
simple because this is a pretty
simplistic<00:02:47.989> album<00:02:48.769> but<00:02:48.919> not<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.159> a<00:02:49.189> bad<00:02:49.400> way<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
simplistic album but not in a bad way I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.780 
simplistic album but not in a bad way I
just<00:02:50.510> think<00:02:50.659> it's<00:02:50.780> interesting<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.489> what<00:02:52.489> is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
just think it's interesting that what is

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.509 
just think it's interesting that what is
happening<00:02:53.689> on<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.900> album<00:02:54.139> to<00:02:54.530> me<00:02:54.650> seems<00:02:55.010> kind

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
happening on this album to me seems kind

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.039 
happening on this album to me seems kind
of<00:02:55.730> obvious<00:02:56.449> and<00:02:57.409> yet<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.219> works<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.030> well<00:02:59.060> it

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
of obvious and yet it works so well it

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.069 
of obvious and yet it works so well it
sounds<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:00.889> good<00:03:01.189> and<00:03:01.519> for<00:03:02.480> some<00:03:02.629> reason<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.049> lot

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
sounds so good and for some reason a lot

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.709 
sounds so good and for some reason a lot
of<00:03:03.260> producers<00:03:03.790> overlook<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.000> kind<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.359> style

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
of producers overlook this kind of style

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.899 
of producers overlook this kind of style
this<00:03:06.260> kind<00:03:06.469> of<00:03:06.530> aesthetic<00:03:06.829> but<00:03:07.310> that's<00:03:07.489> not<00:03:07.730> to

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
this kind of aesthetic but that's not to

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.939 
this kind of aesthetic but that's not to
say<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.359> think<00:03:08.719> this<00:03:08.840> album<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.439> perfect

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:09.949 
say that I think this album is perfect

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.399 
say that I think this album is perfect
or<00:03:10.219> that<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.489> think<00:03:10.879> it's<00:03:11.030> without<00:03:11.810> its<00:03:12.109> lower

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
or that I think it's without its lower

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.679 
or that I think it's without its lower
points<00:03:13.010> one<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:13.519> least<00:03:13.790> favorite<00:03:13.939> moments

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
points one of my least favorite moments

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.390 
points one of my least favorite moments
is<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.439> third<00:03:15.650> track<00:03:15.949> of<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.189> album

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
is on the third track of this album

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.399 
is on the third track of this album
burned<00:03:16.849> out<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.780> something<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.229> also

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
burned out it's something that also

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.349 
burned out it's something that also
happens<00:03:18.919> on<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.189> last<00:03:19.370> track<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.120> album

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
happens on the last track of this album

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.020 
happens on the last track of this album
too<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.139> for<00:03:21.889> some<00:03:22.099> reason<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:22.579> really

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
too and for some reason it just really

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.999 
too and for some reason it just really
rubs<00:03:23.329> me<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.629> wrong<00:03:23.780> way<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.799> said

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:25.009 
rubs me the wrong way like I said

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:26.469 
rubs me the wrong way like I said
earlier<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.489> find<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.939> album<00:03:26.329> really

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
earlier I find this album really

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.259 
earlier I find this album really
mesmerizing<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:28.099> like<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.729> feeling<00:03:29.030> I

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
mesmerizing and I like that feeling I

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.569 
mesmerizing and I like that feeling I
like<00:03:29.509> kind<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.840> feeling<00:03:30.169> hypnotized<00:03:30.799> by<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
like kind of feeling hypnotized by the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.449 
like kind of feeling hypnotized by the
repetition<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.989> textures<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.799> this

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
repetition and the textures of this

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
repetition and the textures of this
album<00:03:34.729> but<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.400> third<00:03:37.699> song<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:38.389> are

album but this third song there are
these<00:03:38.599> really<00:03:39.040> disembodied<00:03:40.040> vocals<00:03:40.729> floating

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
these really disembodied vocals floating

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.890 
these really disembodied vocals floating
around<00:03:41.599> in<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.889> air<00:03:43.129> surrounding<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:44.509> track

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
around in the air surrounding this track

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.920 
around in the air surrounding this track
and<00:03:45.199> I<00:03:45.709> don't<00:03:46.579> know<00:03:46.819> they're<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.569> kind<00:03:47.870> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
and I don't know they're just kind of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.780 
and I don't know they're just kind of
killing<00:03:48.139> my<00:03:48.379> buzz<00:03:48.560> they<00:03:49.129> just<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:49.639> feel

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
killing my buzz they just don't feel

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.990 
killing my buzz they just don't feel
like<00:03:49.849> they<00:03:50.150> fit<00:03:50.479> into<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.500> song<00:03:52.159> at<00:03:52.400> any<00:03:52.579> point

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
like they fit into the song at any point

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.539 
like they fit into the song at any point
for<00:03:53.659> me<00:03:53.900> whereas<00:03:54.319> everything<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:54.829> locked<00:03:55.159> into

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
for me whereas everything is locked into

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.179 
for me whereas everything is locked into
this<00:03:55.759> rhythmic<00:03:56.599> Tetris<00:03:57.500> puzzle<00:03:58.009> where

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
this rhythmic Tetris puzzle where

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.099 
this rhythmic Tetris puzzle where
everything<00:03:58.759> has<00:03:58.939> a<00:03:58.969> place<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.599> everything

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
everything has a place and everything

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.379 
everything has a place and everything
has<00:04:00.259> a<00:04:00.290> purpose<00:04:00.590> these<00:04:01.310> vocals<00:04:01.909> are<00:04:02.060> kind<00:04:02.239> of

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
has a purpose these vocals are kind of

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.469 
has a purpose these vocals are kind of
calling<00:04:03.290> out<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.799> not<00:04:04.189> really<00:04:04.479> adding

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 
calling out and not really adding

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.800 
calling out and not really adding
anything<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:07.040> kind<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.340> distracting<00:04:08.060> like<00:04:08.719> I

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
anything just kind of distracting like I

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.479 
anything just kind of distracting like I
said<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:09.169> happens<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.739> last<00:04:09.859> track<00:04:10.250> too

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
said that happens on the last track too

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.580 
said that happens on the last track too
but<00:04:10.639> I<00:04:10.669> think<00:04:10.939> I<00:04:11.120> may<00:04:11.539> like<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.810> track<00:04:12.289> even

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
but I think I may like that track even

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.729 
but I think I may like that track even
less<00:04:12.769> because<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.250> beat<00:04:13.489> is<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:14.469> little<00:04:15.469> off

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
less because the beat is a little off

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.620 
less because the beat is a little off
for<00:04:16.099> me<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.310> kind<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.579> sounds<00:04:16.969> like<00:04:17.000> listening

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
for me it kind of sounds like listening

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.390 
for me it kind of sounds like listening
to<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.930> copy-machine<00:04:18.650> make<00:04:19.340> about<00:04:19.609> 2000<00:04:20.599> copies

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
to a copy-machine make about 2000 copies

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.850 
to a copy-machine make about 2000 copies
non-stop<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.540> not<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> traditional<00:04:23.470> rhythm

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
non-stop it's not a traditional rhythm

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.740 
non-stop it's not a traditional rhythm
and<00:04:24.040> that's<00:04:24.250> fine<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.850> cool<00:04:25.150> with<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.509> I

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
and that's fine I'm cool with that I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.300 
and that's fine I'm cool with that I
think<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.290> actually<00:04:26.500> would<00:04:26.860> have<00:04:26.919> liked<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
that song offered as much progression as

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.520 
that song offered as much progression as
many<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> other<00:04:34.479> tracks<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.169> this<00:04:35.320> album
