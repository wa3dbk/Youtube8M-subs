00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.770 
the surface doesn't darken like it did
before<00:03:59.620> that's<00:04:00.609> how<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.849> know<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.299> area<00:04:01.540> of

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
before that's how you know that area of

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.800 
before that's how you know that area of
the<00:04:01.900> project<00:04:02.349> has<00:04:02.470> been<00:04:02.500> sealed<00:04:03.150> again<00:04:04.150> every

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
the project has been sealed again every

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.839 
the project has been sealed again every
project<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.379> different<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.310> number<00:04:06.700> of

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
project is different so the number of

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.699 
project is different so the number of
times<00:04:07.090> you'll<00:04:07.450> have<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.840> repeat<00:04:08.170> these<00:04:08.349> steps

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
times you'll have to repeat these steps

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.860 
times you'll have to repeat these steps
will<00:04:08.920> vary<00:04:09.209> remember<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.359> your<00:04:10.510> concrete

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
will vary remember that your concrete

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.440 
will vary remember that your concrete
project<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.409> like<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> sponge<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.310> means<00:04:12.790> that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
project is like a sponge that means that

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.659 
project is like a sponge that means that
if<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.840> absorbing<00:04:14.380> water<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.549> absorb

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
if it is absorbing water it can absorb

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.849 
if it is absorbing water it can absorb
more<00:04:16.120> sealer<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.019> repeat<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.500> sealing

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
more sealer so repeat the sealing

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.680 
more sealer so repeat the sealing
process<00:04:18.010> until<00:04:18.789> no<00:04:18.820> part<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.389> your<00:04:19.510> project

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
process until no part of your project

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.510 
process until no part of your project
absorbs<00:04:20.320> water<00:04:22.530> now<00:04:23.530> step<00:04:23.919> 5

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
absorbs water now step 5

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.879 
absorbs water now step 5
let<00:04:25.300> your<00:04:25.479> project<00:04:25.900> carefully<00:04:26.380> dry<00:04:26.590> overnight

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889
