00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
so for me depending on who I'm attacking

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.260 
so for me depending on who I'm attacking
I'd<00:01:43.750> usually<00:01:44.110> cheap<00:01:44.800> shot<00:01:45.069> girl<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.849> then

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
I'd usually cheap shot girl and then

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.900 
I'd usually cheap shot girl and then
maybe<00:01:46.569> do<00:01:47.259> an<00:01:47.410> additional<00:01:47.950> ambush<00:01:48.459> or<00:01:48.610> maybe

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
maybe do an additional ambush or maybe

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.940 
maybe do an additional ambush or maybe
sometimes<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.509> would<00:01:49.660> just<00:01:49.869> do<00:01:50.080> girl<00:01:50.319> and<00:01:50.649> then

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
sometimes I would just do girl and then

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.830 
sometimes I would just do girl and then
ambush<00:01:51.490> ambush<00:01:51.640> or<00:01:52.030> whatever<00:01:52.569> combination

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840

recommend using this kind of at half

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.030 
recommend using this kind of at half
health<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.179> then<00:02:10.840> use<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.319> patch<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.860> less

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
because I haven't played assassination

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.059
