00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:33.990 
perfect and then I'm going to just go
with<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.500> grain<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.160> curl<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:28.019> up

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.900 

Camilla<00:03:35.000> p.m.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.820 

probably<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:45.960> to<00:03:46.020> secure<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:46.500> another

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
probably going to secure it with another

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:59.600 
probably going to secure it with another
in<00:03:47.160> as<00:03:47.340> well<00:03:55.430> okay<00:03:57.200> hook<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.470> one<00:03:58.950> I'm

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
in as well okay hook up that one I'm

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.720 
in as well okay hook up that one I'm
going<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.120> take<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.830> one<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.280> I'm<00:04:02.550> going<00:04:02.700> to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
going to take this one and I'm going to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.640 
going to take this one and I'm going to
use<00:04:03.060> my<00:04:03.090> brush<00:04:03.540> again<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.050> smooth<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> sides

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
use my brush again to smooth the sides

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:15.980 
use my brush again to smooth the sides
and<00:04:11.180> then<00:04:12.180> I'm<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:12.960> going<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:14.780> reform<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
and then I'm just going to reform the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:30.200 
and then I'm just going to reform the
curl<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:26.180> put<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> pin<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:27.570> there<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:29.820> parts<00:04:30.120> a

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
curl and put a pin in there this parts a

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.480 
curl and put a pin in there this parts a
little<00:04:30.240> bit<00:04:30.780> tricky<00:04:31.170> but<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.680> think<00:04:32.130> we<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.250> do

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
little bit tricky but I think we can do

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.860 
little bit tricky but I think we can do
it<00:04:33.230> okay<00:04:34.230> then<00:04:35.220> I'll<00:04:35.340> put<00:04:35.520> one<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> back<00:04:36.510> to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
it okay then I'll put one in the back to

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.950 
it okay then I'll put one in the back to
also<00:04:37.110> secure<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.590 

okay<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:44.800> what's<00:04:45.280> great<00:04:45.460> about<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.789> is<00:04:45.850> you

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.249 
the side and go sort of twist the hair
right<00:05:21.940> so<00:05:22.060> I'm<00:05:22.120> going<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.270> go<00:05:22.479> the<00:05:23.020> direction

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
right so I'm going to go the direction

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.570 
right so I'm going to go the direction
that<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.740> curls<00:05:24.039> want<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.340> go<00:05:24.479> okay<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.460> then

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
that the curls want to go okay and then

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.249 
that the curls want to go okay and then
you<00:05:27.759> can<00:05:27.910> do<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.360> two<00:05:28.449> ways<00:05:28.599> the<00:05:29.139> way

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
you can do this one of two ways the way

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.400 
you can do this one of two ways the way
I<00:05:29.289> did<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:29.800> was<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.949> actually<00:05:30.130> took<00:05:30.490> pins<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.810> I

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
I did it was I actually took pins and I

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.480 
I did it was I actually took pins and I
put<00:05:33.099> them<00:05:33.310> in<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.630> hair<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.050> hold<00:05:35.289> it<00:05:35.470> but<00:05:35.830> the

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
put them in the hair to hold it but the

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.420 
put them in the hair to hold it but the
easier<00:05:36.789> way<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.090> do<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.509> would<00:05:37.659> be<00:05:37.720> to<00:05:37.900> just<00:05:38.620> get

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
easier way to do it would be to just get

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.670 
easier way to do it would be to just get
a<00:05:40.080> hair<00:05:41.080> tie<00:05:41.259> and<00:05:41.289> put<00:05:41.680> it<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:41.919> end<00:05:42.159> but<00:05:42.909> I

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
a hair tie and put it on the end but I

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.860 
a hair tie and put it on the end but I
like<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.710> get<00:05:45.930> creative<00:05:47.039> so<00:05:48.039> I'll<00:05:48.159> put<00:05:48.870> some

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
like to get creative so I'll put some

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.969 
like to get creative so I'll put some
pins<00:05:50.169> in<00:05:50.380> there<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:54.960> some<00:05:55.960> tinned<00:05:56.320> in<00:05:56.710> here

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
pins in there and some tinned in here
