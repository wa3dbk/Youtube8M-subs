00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.440
 devices use special properties 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 boundary area called pn 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.200
 transition due to thermal movement 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.820
 electrons to their unter youtube and manual 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 area and holes in electronic leaving and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.259
 compensated and charges 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.680
 ahead the next region are electrons and 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.989
 holes recombine with each other wherein 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.360
 formed are not compensated and 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.120
 and he and on the border between the areas 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.089
 there are oppositely charged layers and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.790
 an electric field appears between them 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.800
 it prevents further diffusion 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.290
 electrons and holes and between regions 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.860
 crystals form a layer of fixed 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.710
 charges 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 called the barrier layer 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.690
 at 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.000
 if the peripheral field is external 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.170
 The source has the same direction as 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.530
 and internal expansion occurs 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.530
 barrier layer 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.390
 if the external electric field has 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
 opposite direction to the inside 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.360
 field pn transitions on electrons and holes 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.130
 under the influence of this field 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.130
 overcome the area of ​​the pn junction 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.190
 destruction of the barrier layer occurs 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.350
 such inclusion of pn-transition is called 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.780
 straight and that's only with this inclusion 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.120
 pn junction significantly more than 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.590
 inclusion in broccoli common 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.590
 diodes they look like 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.590
 schematically 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.380
 quickly 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 at 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.060
 for any inclusion in the epic chain 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.180
 the conclusions of the organic power of the crystal 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.310
 emitter and collector one of pn 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 transitions are included in 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 reverse direction so the current in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.560
 the collector circuit there estero practically 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.560
 missing 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.760
 we 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890
 at 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 at 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.540
 2nd you through the emitter transition to create 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.380
 a small current that cue comes in will withdraw 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.730
 troubadour 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.730
 and penetrate the collector 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.410
 manages the emitter transition debt 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 can control the current in the collector circuit 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.950
 therefore the change in the strength of the currents of the circuits 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.140
 emitter junction will lead to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.350
 synchronous change in the current strength in the circuit 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.209
 the collector and the voltage across the resistor 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.890
 enabled for the same purpose change 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.890
 Voltage Indicator Voltmeter 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.099
 unlike bipolar mister otherwise 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.319
 arranged works field effect transistor he 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.379
 is a thin plate 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.769
 semiconductor with one pn junction in 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.540
 the central part of the electrode from which 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.700
 begin to move the main carriers 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:46.220
 charge is called the origins which they 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.220
 current moving 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.400
 conductivity control electrode 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.360
 channel is called the shutter and pass it 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.490
 voltage between source and drain 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.840
 semiconductor then narrow channel arises 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.440
 electricity 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.840
 if you connect the negative pole 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.050
 shutter sources closing layer 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.120
 expands narrows only conductive 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.610
 channel 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.800
 field-effect transistor control 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 carried by the gate voltage then 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.150
 have an electric field
