00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello everyone, quite a recent purchase in 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.730
 oriflame I very much 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.770
 disappointed 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
 so I decided to make a small video 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.320
 about these funds it will be like 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 see the shadow and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.730
 so you just do not stumble upon the same 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 the problem is that i am if they spent 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.220
 money means I bought if you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.180
 previous video we inspected the parcel from 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.150
 oriflame 2 then I bought these 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 troll blue black white and green i 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.059
 stayed 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 they are very disappointed in principle 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.000
 as in the same way that I told 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.730
 colors I didn't like these shadows from 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.309
 series 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.649
 eyeshadow one hundred percent little color 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 the fact that it does not correspond to what 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.530
 the picture was now sparkling in the left i 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 I took myself magic and black it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.930
 must be so matt beautiful and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.120
 witch green is good i'm foolish not 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 I bought almost everything I just did not 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.189
 really liked the price first see 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.560
 1990 secondly so everything is beautiful on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.780
 The picture shows what I really thought. 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.470
 buy or everything except from this gold 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 why am I not using such common 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 what i'm staying cited well what am i 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 said first does not match 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.119
 Generally pictures in the second as I already 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 applied to her hand forever she 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 makes no difference here again you 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 I will show not only that he is no 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.240
 not sparkling white he is very very bad 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.549
 applied on the eyelids very badly him 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.040
 you can't actually see it in 5-6 layers 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.229
 apply and still it is not visible then 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 It has in the package he would like as white as 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.939
 on eyes at all no, I am very 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.439
 left disappointed with this color that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.969
 As for his black it certainly shows but 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.969
 he is not so 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.119
 matt black how i wanted here look 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 Look at the pictures which one is black 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.220
 and here it is some kind of asphalt color 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.060
 ashen black gray-black but not like that 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 thermonuclear as in the picture is applied 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 Of course he is well that is, he seems to be the color 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.580
 gives black 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.850
 but for centuries he's so scary I'm real 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.060
 I was very, very little dissatisfied 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.890
 the fact that it is already the same principle and 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.260
 green that is here even 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.190
 again compare pictures 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.670
 see which clock in the picture I will try 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.670
 find focus 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.500
 look again, different from 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.140
 find some kind of gray 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.140
 out with the sparkles of course goes with this 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.720
 they are not fooled but he goes not quite 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.989
 tight green color which was specified 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.840
 in the picture and again this light 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.720
 not at all and very bad 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.940
 applied but it also needs some 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.640
 layers that is among these all of course 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.920
 shadows are best applied scientist but still 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.410
 a very big minus of these sect not 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 it is that they do not last long 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.550
 For centuries, they very quickly roll down 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.920
 they don't really have their own 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.010
 one hundred percent color overall i stayed 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.220
 very disappointed I do not recommend 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.160
 buy this series eye shadow hundred 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.010
 percent color is good i bought them 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.550
 for 1990 they are even cheaper for me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.890
 cost there for 16 kopecks well what 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.190
 I bought only three but if I still 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.850
 I bought 33 hryvnias and I would take everything 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.730
 would be very dissatisfied 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.280
 second i mean and second moment who 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.130
 I saw my video how to put ball 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.190
 shadows you already saw i think these shadows 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.600
 series of giordani gold they already unfortunately 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.570
 I have no ball 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.760
 they are already in my powder 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.790
 explained why we would just not have 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.239
 survived but as frayed heads powder yes 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.209
 they are applied become better but 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.630
 again they must be applied in several 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.580
 layers and they are again very bad 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.800
 money that is if you so take 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.990
 the applicator is no longer ball shadows 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.930
 and here is just what's left of them 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.419
 apply this powder 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.430
 apply apply the color which is already 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.320
 but more or less it will turn out but it is such 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.630
 here more or less you see such a couple 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.930
 metallic color goes but on the eyes 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.340
 in general he does not hold he disappears and 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.200
 instantly whether i'm not absorbed either 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.680
 I know what happens to these shadows 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.250
 there is the very first purchase for so much 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.760
 years in the reframe so I stayed 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:09.050
 disappointed I really donâ€™t know years 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.600
 probably already 4 if not more that is 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 already consistently use their cosmetics 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.430
 I liked everything, everything suited everything 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.810
 it was perfect all toning powder mascara 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.780
 waterproof mascara took a very long time 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.020
 true but 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.000
 I like everything but it's just me with 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.980
 legs knocked down honestly even gone 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.260
 the desire to take something from them especially 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.570
 decorative cosmetics but I hope that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.750
 All my future purchases will be more 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.590
 successful so i can only say 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.690
 I wish you successful purchases less 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.280
 cosmetically any disappointments and 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.280
 so that your money does not fly to the wind 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 until
