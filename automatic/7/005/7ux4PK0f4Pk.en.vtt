00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this that way you can put the pin in to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
this that way you can put the pin in to
stop<00:01:53.880> ready<00:01:54.240> hot<00:01:54.420> glue<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:56.100> you're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you can consult other videos to figure

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
you can consult other videos to figure
out<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> shape<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> shape<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
out what the shape that's the shape of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560 
out what the shape that's the shape of
it<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> end<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.909> putting<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.360> like

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it because you end up putting it in like

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
it because you end up putting it in like
this<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.610> rubber<00:02:05.880> bands

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this so you can kind of rubber bands

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
this so you can kind of rubber bands
pull<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.129> one

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
