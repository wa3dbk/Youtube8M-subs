to be constant 10 there we go and under

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.089 
to be constant 10 there we go and under
here<00:02:26.719> it's<00:02:27.719> going<00:02:28.109> to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.909> less<00:02:29.909> than<00:02:31.040> there<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
here it's going to be less than there we

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.899 
here it's going to be less than there we
go<00:02:32.219> and<00:02:32.569> count<00:02:33.620> human<00:02:34.620> did<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.700> clogged

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
go and count human did I just clogged

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.099 
go and count human did I just clogged
damage<00:02:36.180> okay<00:02:36.269> why<00:02:36.540> do<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.689> keep<00:02:36.810> calling<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
damage okay why do I keep calling a

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.479 
damage okay why do I keep calling a
human<00:02:37.469> damage<00:02:37.739> upgrade<00:02:38.719> there<00:02:39.719> we<00:02:39.840> go<00:02:40.489> cued

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
human damage upgrade there we go cued

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.059 
human damage upgrade there we go cued
more<00:02:42.060> better<00:02:42.359> with<00:02:42.989> constant<00:02:43.590> 10<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> what

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
more better with constant 10 and so what

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.039 
more better with constant 10 and so what
I<00:02:47.099> believe<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.639> is<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:47.939> this<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
I believe is this is how this is the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.750 
I believe is this is how this is the
condition<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.530> it'll<00:02:49.859> show<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.159> icon<00:02:50.639> in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
condition that it'll show the icon in

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.390 
condition that it'll show the icon in
the<00:02:50.849> command<00:02:51.180> card<00:02:51.419> of<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.870> building<00:02:52.400> down

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the command card of the building down

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.580 
the command card of the building down
here<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:53.639> your<00:02:53.730> interface<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.239> game<00:02:54.419> and<00:02:54.629> this

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
here in your interface in game and this

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.520 
here in your interface in game and this
is<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.799> believe<00:02:56.659> what<00:02:57.659> I'm<00:02:57.930> not<00:02:58.200> totally<00:02:58.349> sure

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
is I believe what I'm not totally sure

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.500 
is I believe what I'm not totally sure
what<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.799> means<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.879> put<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.359> in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
what this means but this I put this in

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.020 
what this means but this I put this in
here<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.810> works<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:01.319> let's<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.730> leave<00:03:02.879> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
here and it works so let's just leave it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.860 
here and it works so let's just leave it
at<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.349> less<00:03:04.650> than<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:05.040> good<00:03:05.129> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
at that and this less than is good and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.629 
at that and this less than is good and
let's<00:03:06.870> save<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:10.010> one<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.819> go<00:03:11.939> right<00:03:12.329> name

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
let's save so one there we go right name

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.629 
let's save so one there we go right name
and<00:03:14.639> now<00:03:14.969> let's<00:03:15.299> go<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> our<00:03:16.310> ability<00:03:17.310> where's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
there you go learn human damage upgrade

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
there you go learn human damage upgrade
and<00:03:46.199> set<00:03:46.949> that<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.250> okay

I think that's good okay so we have our
10<00:04:19.880> levels<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:22.180> yep<00:04:23.180> our<00:04:23.480> research<00:04:24.200> has<00:04:24.230> the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
10 levels here yep our research has the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.660 
10 levels here yep our research has the
requirement<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.400> there<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:27.590> now<00:04:28.130> does<00:04:28.460> our

requirement in there and now does our

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.940 
requirement in there and now does our
building<00:04:30.940> our<00:04:31.940> HQ<00:04:32.420> building<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
building our HQ building have the

going to add a fourth ability called HQ

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.540 
going to add a fourth ability called HQ
research<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.860> ability<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.310> when<00:04:46.460> we

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
research and that ability is when we

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.940 
research and that ability is when we
just<00:04:46.730> made<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.320> then<00:04:48.320> we<00:04:48.380> go<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.650> command

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
just made and then we go to the command

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.030 
just made and then we go to the command

believe<00:05:19.160> we<00:05:19.400> are<00:05:19.430> done<00:05:19.640> with<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> data<00:05:20.090> editor

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
believe we are done with the data editor

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.730 
believe we are done with the data editor
but<00:05:21.010> as<00:05:22.010> always<00:05:22.070> things<00:05:22.850> tend<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.330> go<00:05:23.450> wrong<00:05:23.690> so

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.530 

once<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:27.890> do<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.550> next<00:05:28.730> tutorial<00:05:28.970> which<00:05:29.360> will

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
once I do the next tutorial which will

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.030 
once I do the next tutorial which will
be<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.750> trigger<00:05:29.930> editor<00:05:30.320> we're<00:05:30.770> going<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.919> go

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
be the trigger editor we're going to go

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.710 
be the trigger editor we're going to go
in<00:05:31.160> game<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:31.430> test<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:31.880> I<00:05:31.970> might<00:05:32.270> be<00:05:32.419> making<00:05:32.570> a

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
in game and test and I might be making a

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.180 
in game and test and I might be making a
return<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.169> data<00:05:33.380> editor<00:05:33.530> depending<00:05:34.100> on

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
return to the data editor depending on

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.370 
return to the data editor depending on
whether<00:05:35.000> or<00:05:35.090> not<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.360> had<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.660> lot<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:35.870> bugs<00:05:36.110> in<00:05:36.290> it

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
whether or not I had a lot of bugs in it

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.850 
whether or not I had a lot of bugs in it
while<00:05:37.280> I'm<00:05:37.520> guessing<00:05:38.180> i<00:05:38.270> will<00:05:38.419> so<00:05:38.860> that

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
while I'm guessing i will so that

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.650 
while I'm guessing i will so that
concludes<00:05:40.040> this<00:05:40.310> tutorial<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.330> next<00:05:41.480> one

will be setting up all the triggers to

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.360 
will be setting up all the triggers to
do<00:05:43.340> all<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.540> waves<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:45.050> set<00:05:45.950> up<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.130> player
