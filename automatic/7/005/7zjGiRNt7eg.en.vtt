actually need to fabricate a corndog
I'm<00:00:26.099> 100%<00:00:26.609> said<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.210> chef<00:00:27.390> cars<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.960> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I'm 100% said it with chef cars got this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
I'm 100% said it with chef cars got this
indeed<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.160> he<00:00:29.550> ground<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.060> both<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
indeed it was he ground up both the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.790 
indeed it was he ground up both the
pretzel<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> popcorn<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.470> make<00:00:31.619> his

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
pretzel and the popcorn to make his

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.049 
pretzel and the popcorn to make his
breading<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.309> think<00:00:32.579> he<00:00:32.640> should<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.850> run<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.459 
breading I think he should have run it
through<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> food<00:00:33.329> processor<00:00:33.809> he<00:00:33.870> didn't<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
through a food processor he didn't it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.290 
through a food processor he didn't it
wasn't<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.160> unpleasant<00:00:35.730> bite<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

wasn't actually an unpleasant bite it
just<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:37.020> wasn't<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.350> corndog<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.010> he'd<00:00:38.190> had

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just really wasn't a corndog if he'd had

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.799 
just really wasn't a corndog if he'd had
told<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> me<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> bite-sized<00:00:39.329> corndog
