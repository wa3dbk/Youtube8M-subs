00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
them so my elbows are back a little bit

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
them so my elbows are back a little bit
and<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.409> gonna<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> notice<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.220> my

inner thigh adductor muscles and it

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.610 
inner thigh adductor muscles and it
stimulates<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.239> quite<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> bit<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.590> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
stimulates them quite a bit it can be a

stimulates them quite a bit it can be a
little<00:03:46.829> tender<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.370> there<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.060> go<00:03:48.209> ahead<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
little tender in there so go ahead and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.270 
little tender in there so go ahead and
squish<00:03:48.810> them<00:03:48.989> down<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.769> want<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.040> feet<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
be flat they'll tend to be on the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.750 
be flat they'll tend to be on the
outside<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.139> your<00:03:52.260> feet<00:03:52.470> push<00:03:53.250> them<00:03:53.370> down<00:03:53.519> flat

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
outside of your feet push them down flat

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.119 
outside of your feet push them down flat
that'll<00:03:54.480> push<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.810> brick<00:03:54.989> together<00:03:55.290> more<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
that'll push the brick together more and

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.760 
that'll push the brick together more and
then<00:03:56.750> do<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.930> again

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
then do it again

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.040 
then do it again
this<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.820> about<00:04:00.030> quality<00:04:00.510> movement<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:00.990> you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
this is about quality movement so you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.840 
this is about quality movement so you
want<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.320> really<00:04:01.530> look<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.070> pay<00:04:02.250> attention<00:04:02.670> if

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850

you<00:04:02.910> have<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.120> mirror<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:03.540> even<00:04:03.750> better<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
you have a mirror it's even better and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.610 
you have a mirror it's even better and
then<00:04:05.100> come<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.520> back<00:04:05.730> up<00:04:06.290> press<00:04:07.290> your<00:04:07.500> feet

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
into the floor back down a set of three

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.100 
into the floor back down a set of three
is<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.520> great<00:04:11.850> way<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> start<00:04:12.390> you're<00:04:12.930> not

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
is a great way to start you're not

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.960 
is a great way to start you're not
looking<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.130> an<00:04:14.220> exercise<00:04:14.730> this

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
looking to do this it's an exercise this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.620 
looking to do this it's an exercise this
is<00:04:15.120> more<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:16.459> movement<00:04:17.459> evaluation<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.510> your

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
is more of a movement evaluation on your

is more of a movement evaluation on your
part<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.350> learning<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.340> move<00:04:20.489> differently

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
part and learning to move differently

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.630 
part and learning to move differently
rather<00:04:21.750> than<00:04:22.040> thinking<00:04:23.040> of<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.310> as<00:04:23.520> an

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
rather than thinking of this as an

rather than thinking of this as an
exercise<00:04:24.020> for<00:04:25.020> strengthening<00:04:25.080> purpose<00:04:25.890> is

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
exercise for strengthening purpose is

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.210 
exercise for strengthening purpose is
like<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.280> Calif<00:04:26.670> Inuk<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.300> not<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:28.220> great

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
like a Calif Inuk this is not that great

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.220 
like a Calif Inuk this is not that great
for<00:04:29.490> opening<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> hips<00:04:30.390> providing<00:04:30.960> mobility

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
for opening the hips providing mobility

transference<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.630> force<00:04:37.020> that's

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
transference of the force that's

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.290
