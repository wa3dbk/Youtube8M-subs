 of Asian descent Hooft 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.970
 Of course, love is spinning 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.349
 So, but a passage everyone should not be touched one to this 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.580
 The occasion is "I believe Israel 20 17 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 Oracle created itself 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.210
 Beneficiary friendship 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.610
 that's not always the case 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.300
 No, instead, it comes at the time of my daughter my statement Wittes 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 to commit a murder 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 The hardest part was undoubtedly 000 customers 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 the Big Lebowski when the movie was anyway very difficult but what the good 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.360
 understates 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.400
 Kalle gives a law decisively whispering laughing crying I know 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.510

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.400
 cooked but also Swatch movie to see how it breathes with it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 Thank God there is no company Stadler 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.020
 So, if there is a lot of rumors about the property tax we 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.750
 standing in Hollywood with one leg 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.520
 Cook I am concerned about the bottles 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.130

 Catchment area of ​​the film catchment area of ​​the German language relatively small im 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.760
 Make comparison in English American 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.690
 There is a famous one in me where I have asked for something like that 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 became the improvised Stratmann surf 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 as Grand Inquisitor 7 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.300
 Columbus 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.240
 and knew he reported four and a half million dollars for it 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.070

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.369
 gun salutes 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.369
 I do both is the same 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.579
 on 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.310
 Dr especially fun 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.099
 Stay at us I believe 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.779
 at the critical 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.430
 I still remember the keeping with it did not meet 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.470
 I have to hear the voice of John Travolta children standing here right now 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.429
 let the gate in there and art i threw myself down 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.649
 I did not know that she was speaking so fast 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.540
 What we did not know at the time is going to be such a cult 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.260
 we just have to do it with a good temper 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.249
 and that's also my absolute Groult movie 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.069
 the window was not very clear 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.009
 He always made fun of John Travolta who looks like he was cloned 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.299
 his own Kloten always said that my time 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.399
 he was once again appeared on the screen after a long time 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.539
 and places of his 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.809
 Cologne's all-make-up and its first appear very much 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.779
 scenic 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.539
 I can also remember well when he stopped long bridge 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.439
 So as I said at Fitschen 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.819
 I really enjoyed it 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.819
 No 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.399
 who, then? 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.059
 that's not what Wehrmann does because I'm used to it 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.629
 to speak on actor faces not so out of the hollow hand as 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.289
 Voice imitator occur 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.039
 in this case may be an exception 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.029
 Read the Bible Bretten 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:43.049
 There is the manufacturer that I can memorize 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.249

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.179
