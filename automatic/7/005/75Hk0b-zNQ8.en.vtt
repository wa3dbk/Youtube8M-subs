don't<00:02:59.070> know<00:02:59.130> why<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> think<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.000> sense<00:03:00.300> UI<00:03:00.780> it's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
don't know why I think the sense UI it's

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.630 
don't know why I think the sense UI it's
kind<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.680> dragging<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:05.370> whole

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
kind of like dragging the the whole

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.780 
kind of like dragging the the whole
phone<00:03:06.630> down<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.040> only<00:03:08.070> drawback

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
phone down so that's the only drawback

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.490 
phone down so that's the only drawback
about<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.720> don't<00:03:09.930> mind<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.470> speed

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
about it but if you don't mind the speed

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.430 
about it but if you don't mind the speed
you<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.440> 1.5

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
you can get this so you have it on 1.5

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.570 
you can get this so you have it on 1.5
16<00:03:17.450> overclocked<00:03:18.450> already<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.370> only<00:03:20.370> getting

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
16 overclocked already and only getting

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.750 
16 overclocked already and only getting
ten<00:03:20.910> something<00:03:21.570> which<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.959> kind<00:03:22.230> of

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
ten something which is kind of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.570 
ten something which is kind of
disappointing<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.160> one<00:03:26.550> of

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
disappointing but I think this is one of

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.220 
disappointing but I think this is one of
the<00:03:26.700> only<00:03:26.880> realms<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.360> has<00:03:27.630> sense<00:03:27.990> three

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the only realms that has sense three

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.560 
the only realms that has sense three
point<00:03:28.500> 0<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:32.220> not<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.430> bad<00:03:32.670> rom<00:03:32.940> run

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
point 0 on it so it's not a bad rom run

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.320 
point 0 on it so it's not a bad rom run
