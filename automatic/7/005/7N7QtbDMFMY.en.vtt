00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 on top of that comes the organ and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.210
 below that comes the pulpit 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.800
 then there is still an open space 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.299
 construction of the reformed church 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.299
 aalburg is increasingly taking shape 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.450
 the church is a special job for the 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.079
 local contractor you already have it 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.840
 done more often 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.460
 and why are you continuing to build 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.079
 completely new church to never 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.149
 The church building will accommodate 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.950
 450 believers 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.830
 that's what it's all about because the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.750
 current centuries old church has been around for years 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 way too small but it is only sometimes and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.300
 two services not in but which tomorrow 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 two services every Sunday morning 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.290
 and then when the second service people 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.420
 can't get in yet 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.900
 Is that annoying for the old one? 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 Church is being searched for new functions 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.079
 hundred meters away in the village at 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the Reformed municipalities they are left with 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.590
 the same problem 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 the church is too small and so goes next 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 month here kick in the ground for the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 new church 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 two new churches almost side by side 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.240
 building one together is not an option 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 and two completely different municipalities 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.340
 yes with different views with 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.729
 different identities or they closed 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 smell just different and that and that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.860
 would not fit together in one building 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.010
 well do not fit there I do not want to say 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 but watch your had not the neighbors 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.110
 eat at the reformed municipalities 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.190
 they do not want their new construction plans to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.350
 explain the camera 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.470
 because many church members and objections 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 against the television medium the churches 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.250
 both cost more than 2 million euros 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.440
 members of the municipality contribute to this 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 they delivered the promised 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.979
 they also promised labor to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 come to help 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.960
 because that seemed to cost top-notch costs 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.080
 in the village of six thousand in boys 6 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.670
 churches 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.120
 another four years ago 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.520
 new built and now again two 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.070
 at which word the most beautiful 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.570
 yes that is undoubtedly this yes yes we 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.340
 We have to go see promise 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.790
 of course we can vote on it later 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.750
 no village 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.750
 well i am the best
