00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.710
 good another form of irrigation 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.710
 and especially when it is very hot 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.810
 is the irrigation and filling of the furrow we would say 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.880
 why 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.789
 because they are the plants need 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.730
 much more water we took a few days of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.900
 hot 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 and they have withered then when 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.620
 that you have to give a contribution 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.260
 of water 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.490
 for example a couple of times per week 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.100
 hit it well what it is 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.859
 all the groove where 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 are the bushes of tomatoes or peppers 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.770
 with what we have sown 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.540
 that have 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.690
 humidity 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.180
 that's how I started doing it 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.940
 at the beginning but clear water 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500
 when the tap is opened it also has its 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.780
 price 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 and this but that can not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.740
 requires an additional expense and some 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 sometimes neither 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.220
 is profitable with what is done with the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.580
 drip irrigation is an entrepreneur 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 poquillo more economic 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.640
 but sometimes as I said it is not 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.750
 enough so you have to water it 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 add a contribution of water 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 today here about 15-20 bushes of tomatoes that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.720
 they are tomatoes 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
 Spanish the tomatoes that we are 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 taking care now a little better because 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.470
 we have already taken and they are going 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.350
 shrinking a little 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.800
 and these are the ones that now that there 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.170
 take care a little better 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.340
 they are still green 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.179
 there are many have many tomatoes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 and very high too 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.340
 for all tomato sites it is huge 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.080
 and let's go 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.250
 we are a little smaller 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.330
 but they go 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.850
 they are growing 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.200
 and here, if you are interested in throwing a 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.420
 poquillo more than more water 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 This one here is pretty big 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.260
 and then it's over the top so much happens 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.650
 of the same all these bushes are 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.420
 full of tea 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 then and you have to be careful when 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.930
 water like this in this way 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.930
 that we are going to sink in 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.150
 in him 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.410
 mud and here we have to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.700
 three little friends that 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.700
 they are green 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.580
 and it's not exactly what they are 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.909
 doing because you're supposed to be 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.909
 little bit 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.220
 2 adjusted it this leaking third 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.090
 out there 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.590
 I do not know what he's painting 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.590
 because that insurance that is left over 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.920
 but creating and increasing the species 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.900
 possibly 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.900
 now that there is a lot of tomato 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.960
 This is like a piece of 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.160
 corsage 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.880
 with a few 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.880
 it has been loaded 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.450
 to wait for it to mature 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.900
 people are already close to 2 meters 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.900
 Tall 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.420
 they become very very large and you 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.420
 places 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.870
 Stick it up so they go up 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.600
 Sometimes Diego tells me to blunt 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.540
 so that they do not grow 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.090
 and so 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.250
 Give strength to what tomatoes are 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.210
 and these others, however, are from another 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.480
 class have many 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.340
 but they are much smaller but they are worth 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.109
 perfectly also 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.109
 and it's also clear 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.300
 now I wanted to teach simply 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.780
 these other tomatoes that we have here 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.780
 planting
