things happen every time there's new
animation<00:00:34.710> characters<00:00:35.430> would<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
animation characters would put just a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
animation characters would put just a
little<00:00:36.510> bit<00:00:36.739> they<00:00:37.739> move<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.790> one

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
little bit they move a little bit to one

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
little bit they move a little bit to one
side<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> other<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.079> wouldn't<00:00:40.410> line

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
side or the other or they wouldn't line

side or the other or they wouldn't line
up<00:00:40.649> nice<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.520> said<00:00:42.180> there's<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> lot<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> problems

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
up nice I said there's a lot of problems

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
up nice I said there's a lot of problems
with<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:43.649> our<00:00:43.680> art<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> animation<00:00:44.430> was

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
with the way our art and animation was

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.500 
with the way our art and animation was
done<00:00:45.860> my<00:00:46.860> fault<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.700> responsibility<00:00:47.820> for

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
done my fault I take responsibility for

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
done my fault I take responsibility for
the<00:00:48.719> design<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.829> times<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.309> know

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the design but a lot of times you know

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
the design but a lot of times you know
certain<00:00:50.730> animations<00:00:51.329> were<00:00:51.600> animated<00:00:52.260> over

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
certain animations were animated over

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
certain animations were animated over
here<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.219> should<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.430> been<00:00:53.520> over

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
here when they should have been over

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
here when they should have been over
here<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> programmer<00:00:55.739> had

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
here a little bit so the programmer had

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
here a little bit so the programmer had
to<00:00:56.100> compensate<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.329> code<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.989> hack

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to compensate for that in code to hack

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.920 
to compensate for that in code to hack
some<00:00:58.649> offsets<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> positions<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.809> would

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
some offsets and positions and it would

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170 
some offsets and positions and it would
usually<00:01:01.140> work<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> lot<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> times

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
usually work but a lot of times

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
usually work but a lot of times
unfortunately<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.170> saw<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
unfortunately you saw a lot of that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.539 
unfortunately you saw a lot of that
really<00:01:05.400> jerky<00:01:06.590> transporting<00:01:07.590> emotion<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
really jerky transporting emotion and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.810 
really jerky transporting emotion and
stuff<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.240> while<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> game<00:01:10.470> worked<00:01:10.830> uprising

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
stuff and while the game worked uprising

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810 
stuff and while the game worked uprising
works<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.570> functions<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.380> fine<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:14.189> didn't

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
works it functions just fine it didn't

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.690 
works it functions just fine it didn't
work<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.600> well<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.369> had<00:01:17.490> some

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
work really well now we had some

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
work really well now we had some
solutions<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.619> needed<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
solutions for that that we needed to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
solutions for that that we needed to
test<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.659> what<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:21.869> important<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
test and what was really important to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
test and what was really important to
see<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.729> could<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> our

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see was could we take all of our

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
see was could we take all of our
animations<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.610> were<00:01:27.390> animated<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
animations that were animated in the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
animations that were animated in the
wrong<00:01:28.560> position<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.159> rotation<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> could<00:01:30.509> we

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
wrong position of rotation and could we

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
wrong position of rotation and could we
simply<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.560> them<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.040> need<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
simply put them where they need it to be

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
simply put them where they need it to be
in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.150> original<00:01:33.180> source<00:01:33.810> animation<00:01:34.470> file<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
in the original source animation file we

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.880 
in the original source animation file we
export<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> use<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.720> properly<00:01:36.890> where

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
export them and use them properly where

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.789 
export them and use them properly where
they<00:01:38.009> were<00:01:38.070> supposed<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:39.799> previously

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
they were supposed to be now previously

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.920 
they were supposed to be now previously
before<00:01:41.070> uprising<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:41.909> released<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
before uprising was released you know I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
before uprising was released you know I
was<00:01:43.170> led<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> believe<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.759> going

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
was led to believe that this was going

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.359 
was led to believe that this was going
to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.030> impossible<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.860> we're<00:01:47.100> working

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to be impossible you know we're working

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.210 
to be impossible you know we're working
with<00:01:47.460> animation<00:01:48.060> files<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.200> years<00:01:49.799> old

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
with animation files that are years old

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.060 
with animation files that are years old
they've<00:01:50.880> been<00:01:51.680> changed<00:01:52.680> different

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
they've been changed different

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
do this was to take the animations that

do this was to take the animations that

product the final export and if we could

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
animations put them where we need it to

animations put them where we need it to
be<00:02:08.849> well<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> perfect<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.770> we

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
be well that would be the perfect so we

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000 
be well that would be the perfect so we
the<00:02:11.480> programmer<00:02:11.930> would<00:02:12.140> no<00:02:12.319> longer<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.709> to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the programmer would no longer have to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
the programmer would no longer have to
hack<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.700> these<00:02:13.849> different<00:02:14.030> rotations

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
hack all of these different rotations

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.380 
hack all of these different rotations
and<00:02:14.930> things<00:02:15.140> together<00:02:15.349> they<00:02:16.160> would<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.580> work

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and things together they would just work

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.750 
and things together they would just work
if<00:02:18.290> they<00:02:18.590> were<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.130> position<00:02:19.640> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
if they were in the right position to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.199 
if they were in the right position to
begin<00:02:19.880> with<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.430> very<00:02:22.430> happy<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.819> report<00:02:23.090> that

took an animation that was 180 degrees
off<00:03:17.329> rotation<00:03:18.970> gave<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.239> us<00:03:20.269> back<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:21.019> the
