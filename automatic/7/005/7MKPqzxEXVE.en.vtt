00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.240 
the block of you for this video I
figured<00:00:55.960> I'd<00:00:56.200> start<00:00:56.560> off<00:00:56.680> with<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:56.860> super

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
figured I'd start off with the super

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.700 
figured I'd start off with the super
assault<00:00:57.610> so<00:00:58.360> I'm<00:00:58.630> going<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.840> go<00:00:59.050> over<00:00:59.080> chance

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
assault so I'm going to go over chance

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.940 
assault so I'm going to go over chance
and<00:00:59.980> quake<00:01:00.190> Dragonoid<00:01:01.290> so<00:01:02.290> let's<00:01:02.650> just<00:01:02.830> get

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
and quake Dragonoid so let's just get

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.680 
and quake Dragonoid so let's just get
right<00:01:03.010> into<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.460> starting<00:01:03.730> out<00:01:04.059> chance

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
right into it starting out chance

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.160 
right into it starting out chance
Dragonoid<00:01:05.199> they're<00:01:05.979> both<00:01:06.190> Ventus<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.510> as<00:01:07.930> far

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
Dragonoid they're both Ventus so as far

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.530 
Dragonoid they're both Ventus so as far
as<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.470> outside<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:09.070> him<00:01:09.220> in<00:01:09.369> ball<00:01:09.580> form<00:01:09.850> it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
as the outside of him in ball form it's

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.090 
as the outside of him in ball form it's
just<00:01:10.780> pretty<00:01:10.930> much<00:01:11.140> green<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.619> white<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
just pretty much green and white the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.040 
just pretty much green and white the
typical<00:01:12.460> Ventus<00:01:12.820> look<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.360> he's<00:01:13.750> not<00:01:13.900> too

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
typical Ventus look so he's not too

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.780 
typical Ventus look so he's not too
impressive<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.770> guess<00:01:15.220> it's<00:01:15.369> kind<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:15.610> cool

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790

impressive I guess it's kind of cool
that<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.210> see<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> diorite<00:01:16.690> here<00:01:17.850> anyway

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850

as far as opening him up see if I can

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
Dragonoid freeroll dragos die if you

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.900 
Dragonoid freeroll dragos die if you
roll<00:01:50.140> lower<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.800> roll<00:01:51.009> one<00:01:51.220> more<00:01:51.250> time<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
roll lower we roll one more time and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.779

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
then remove this card from the game so I

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.190 
then remove this card from the game so I
mean<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.240> could<00:01:55.330> be<00:01:55.450> beneficial<00:01:55.630> if<00:01:56.110> you're

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
mean that could be beneficial if you're

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.380 
mean that could be beneficial if you're
trying<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.530> get<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.709> higher<00:01:56.920> GPA<00:01:57.880> or<00:01:57.910> for<00:01:58.270> him

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
trying to get a higher GPA or for him

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.930 
trying to get a higher GPA or for him
but<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:58.990> actually<00:01:59.530> have<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.160> particular

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
but I actually have a particular

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.040 
but I actually have a particular
strategy<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.569> them<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.810> I'll<00:02:01.929> mention

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
strategy with them that I'll mention

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.499 
strategy with them that I'll mention
later<00:02:02.319> with<00:02:02.709> quake<00:02:03.009> Dragonoid<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.910> think

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
later with quake Dragonoid that I think

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.859 
later with quake Dragonoid that I think
makes<00:02:04.780> him<00:02:04.959> really<00:02:05.170> worthwhile<00:02:06.300> as<00:02:07.300> far<00:02:07.569> as<00:02:07.690> a

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
makes him really worthwhile as far as a

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.520 
makes him really worthwhile as far as a
closing<00:02:08.440> well<00:02:08.679> before<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.250> close<00:02:09.550> him<00:02:09.700> up<00:02:09.789> um<00:02:10.530> he

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
closing well before I close him up um he

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
closing well before I close him up um he
has<00:02:11.680> for<00:02:12.280> manual<00:02:12.580> parts<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.180> his<00:02:13.300> head

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
has for manual parts is just his head

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.089 
has for manual parts is just his head
but<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.959> doesn't<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.290> stay<00:02:14.680> up<00:02:14.800> very<00:02:14.980> well

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
but it doesn't really stay up very well

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.850 
but it doesn't really stay up very well
just<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.959> claws<00:02:16.959> back<00:02:17.170> down<00:02:17.349> but<00:02:17.560> i<00:02:17.620> guess

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
just kind of claws back down but i guess

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.380 
just kind of claws back down but i guess
that<00:02:18.069> helps<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.490> dice<00:02:18.760> throwing<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that helps with the dice throwing if it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.910 
that helps with the dice throwing if it
did<00:02:19.599> stick<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.050> would<00:02:20.170> kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.709> cause

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
did stick it would kind of cause

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
did stick it would kind of cause
problems<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.270> he<00:02:22.420> also<00:02:22.569> has<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.900> bottom

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
problems but on he also has this bottom

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.470 
problems but on he also has this bottom
jaw<00:02:23.470> here<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.860> moves<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.400> these<00:02:24.970> horns<00:02:25.300> here

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
jaw here that moves and these horns here

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.110 
jaw here that moves and these horns here
will<00:02:25.630> come<00:02:25.840> up<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.230> what<00:02:27.130> happens<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.700> he<00:02:27.730> has

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
will come up and what happens is he has

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.510 
will come up and what happens is he has
on<00:02:28.420> special<00:02:29.410> instructions<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.310> come<00:02:30.459> with

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
on special instructions that come with

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520 
on special instructions that come with
him<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.420> pretty<00:02:31.599> much<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:32.020> says<00:02:32.230> when

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
him and it pretty much just says when

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
him and it pretty much just says when
you<00:02:32.560> flip<00:02:33.099> these<00:02:33.250> up<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.239> kind<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.510> gives

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
you flip these up and that kind of gives

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.860 
you flip these up and that kind of gives
you<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> little<00:02:35.050> bit<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.730> something<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.910> push

fast okay that was pretty bad too Homer
time<00:02:49.860> okay<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.010> was<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.129> little<00:02:51.160> better<00:02:51.430> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
time okay that was a little better so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.089 
time okay that was a little better so
that's<00:02:52.780> pretty<00:02:53.140> much<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.920> him

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
that's pretty much all there is to him

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.900 
that's pretty much all there is to him
closing<00:02:55.090> him<00:02:55.180> up<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:57.010> flip<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.459> horns<00:02:57.730> back

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
closing him up just flip the horns back

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.410 
closing him up just flip the horns back
down<00:02:58.170> then<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> head<00:02:59.440> goes<00:02:59.620> back<00:02:59.860> down<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.420> want

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
down then the head goes back down I want

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.540 
down then the head goes back down I want
to<00:03:01.480> put<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> dye<00:03:01.900> back<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.350> his<00:03:02.470> mouth

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
to put the dye back in his mouth

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.480 
to put the dye back in his mouth
and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.120> fold<00:03:04.450> his<00:03:04.660> arms<00:03:04.930> down<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.490> the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
and then just fold his arms down and the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.170 
and then just fold his arms down and the
wings<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> tail<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.710> that's<00:03:09.700> chance

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
wings and the tail so that's chance

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.490 
wings and the tail so that's chance
Dragonoid<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> quake<00:03:12.880> Dragonoid<00:03:13.500> get

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
Dragonoid and then a quake Dragonoid get

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.530 
Dragonoid and then a quake Dragonoid get
again<00:03:14.740> pretty<00:03:14.950> point<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.490> outside<00:03:15.880> he's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
again pretty point on the outside he's

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.000 
again pretty point on the outside he's
got<00:03:16.780> his<00:03:16.960> little<00:03:17.670> thing<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.970> wind<00:03:19.210> up

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:32.910 

alright<00:03:24.010> let's<00:03:24.220> open<00:03:24.400> him<00:03:24.730> up<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:32.410> that's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
alright let's open him up so that's

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.850 
alright let's open him up so that's
pretty<00:03:33.280> much<00:03:33.370> all<00:03:33.610> he<00:03:33.760> does<00:03:33.940> um<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.650> think<00:03:35.650> it's

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
pretty much all he does um I think it's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.470 
pretty much all he does um I think it's
cool<00:03:35.980> when<00:03:36.160> he's<00:03:36.190> moving<00:03:36.460> though<00:03:36.790> like<00:03:37.300> his

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
cool when he's moving though like his

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.090 
cool when he's moving though like his
mouth<00:03:37.690> will<00:03:37.900> kind<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.170> go<00:03:38.500> up<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.800> down<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
mouth will kind of go up and down a

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.010 
mouth will kind of go up and down a
little<00:03:39.430> bit<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.000> mean<00:03:40.240> aside<00:03:40.810> from<00:03:40.870> that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
little bit but I mean aside from that

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.470 
little bit but I mean aside from that
it's<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.380> really<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.710> impressive<00:03:42.450> he's<00:03:43.450> a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
it's not really that impressive he's a

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.080 
it's not really that impressive he's a
950<00:03:44.470> jido<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.070> that<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.340> impressive<00:03:46.590> as<00:03:47.880> far<00:03:48.880> as

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
950 jido so that is impressive as far as

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.320 
950 jido so that is impressive as far as
I'm<00:03:49.390> closing<00:03:50.200> him<00:03:50.320> up<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.730> pretty<00:03:52.060> simple

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
I'm closing him up it's pretty simple

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.810 
I'm closing him up it's pretty simple
just<00:03:52.480> flipped<00:03:52.870> his<00:03:52.990> feet<00:03:53.200> up<00:03:53.520> fold<00:03:54.520> his<00:03:54.670> head

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
just flipped his feet up fold his head

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.350 
just flipped his feet up fold his head
down<00:03:55.000> flip<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.290> there<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:58.060> fold

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
down flip that in there and then fold

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.680 
down flip that in there and then fold
these<00:03:58.540> wings<00:03:59.140> back<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.740> then<00:04:00.490> then<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.510> tail

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
these wings back and then then the tail

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.390 
these wings back and then then the tail
down<00:04:01.900> at<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.200> tip<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.620> then<00:04:02.770> close<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.100> there

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
down at the tip and then close it there

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.430 
down at the tip and then close it there
so<00:04:03.940> he's<00:04:04.210> pretty<00:04:04.330> easy<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.750> close<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.350> he

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
so he's pretty easy to close up to it he

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.200 
so he's pretty easy to close up to it he
has<00:04:05.560> no<00:04:05.740> manual<00:04:06.100> parts<00:04:06.400> aside<00:04:06.670> from<00:04:06.820> winding

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
has no manual parts aside from winding

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.500 
has no manual parts aside from winding
him<00:04:07.330> up<00:04:07.450> there<00:04:08.040> he<00:04:09.040> comes<00:04:09.190> with<00:04:09.489> um<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.970> assume

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
him up there he comes with um I assume

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.070 
him up there he comes with um I assume
it's<00:04:10.959> an<00:04:11.110> evolution<00:04:11.709> card<00:04:11.980> or<00:04:12.780> something<00:04:13.780> like

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
it's an evolution card or something like

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.530 
it's an evolution card or something like
that<00:04:14.140> whatever<00:04:14.770> they<00:04:14.980> call<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.610> still<00:04:16.510> don't

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
that whatever they call it I still don't

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.449 
that whatever they call it I still don't
know<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.810> official<00:04:17.350> name<00:04:17.500> yet<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.280> it's

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
know the official name yet so it's

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.630 
know the official name yet so it's
purple<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.680> then<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:21.010> says<00:04:21.190> evolves

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
purple and then it just says evolves

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.510 
purple and then it just says evolves
from<00:04:21.700> any<00:04:21.970> Drago<00:04:22.330> under<00:04:22.750> 650g<00:04:23.500> power<00:04:23.890> and<00:04:24.250> then

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
from any Drago under 650g power and then

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.190 
from any Drago under 650g power and then
it<00:04:24.610> says<00:04:24.730> unique<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.390> may<00:04:25.540> reroll<00:04:25.960> quick

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
it says unique you may reroll quick

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.980 
it says unique you may reroll quick
Dragonoid<00:04:26.740> once<00:04:26.890> per<00:04:27.070> turn<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.540> mean<00:04:28.900> he's

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
Dragonoid once per turn so I mean he's

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.659 
Dragonoid once per turn so I mean he's
obviously<00:04:29.230> pretty<00:04:29.500> powerful<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.250> then<00:04:30.490> like

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
obviously pretty powerful and then like

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.130 
obviously pretty powerful and then like
I<00:04:30.760> said<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> think<00:04:31.270> chance<00:04:31.540> Dragonoid<00:04:32.050> is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
I said I think chance Dragonoid is

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140 
I said I think chance Dragonoid is
awesome<00:04:32.470> with<00:04:32.620> them<00:04:32.770> because<00:04:32.919> when<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.940> roll

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
awesome with them because when you roll

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.120 
awesome with them because when you roll
the<00:04:34.270> die<00:04:34.419> if<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.720> get<00:04:35.169> something<00:04:35.620> lower<00:04:35.950> you

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
the die if you get something lower you

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.710 
the die if you get something lower you
can<00:04:36.220> obviously<00:04:36.490> evolved<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.060> quake<00:04:37.270> Dragonoid

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
can obviously evolved to quake Dragonoid

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.510 
can obviously evolved to quake Dragonoid
but<00:04:38.110> if<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.440> get<00:04:38.560> something<00:04:38.710> high<00:04:38.890> then<00:04:39.220> you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
but if you get something high then you

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.250 
but if you get something high then you
have<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.669> high-powered<00:04:40.240> chance<00:04:40.480> Dragonoid<00:04:41.080> so

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
have a high-powered chance Dragonoid so

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.190
