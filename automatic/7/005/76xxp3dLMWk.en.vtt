said I think consistency is the best is
the<00:01:54.750> best<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> determine<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.310> good<00:01:56.490> call<00:01:56.700> of

eight<00:04:40.750> matches<00:04:41.200> with<00:04:41.500> some<00:04:42.010> pro<00:04:42.190> players<00:04:42.520> I

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
think that'd be pretty sick I think

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.910 
think that'd be pretty sick I think
that'd<00:04:46.450> be<00:04:46.600> pretty<00:04:46.780> tied<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> weekly<00:04:47.710> series

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
that'd be pretty tied to a weekly series

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.470 
that'd be pretty tied to a weekly series
playing<00:04:48.280> with<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.460> new<00:04:48.550> pro<00:04:48.850> player<00:04:49.090> every<00:04:49.450> week
