00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.920
 there is a wide choice of plaster with 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.170
 properties and features 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.230
 which are specific to each product the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.599
 hardness the setting time the texture and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 the fluidity of the mixture with the water goes 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.680
 to be as many factors that will us 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.199
 to interest make a good plaster depends 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 therefore the starting mixture as well as 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.010
 the utility that we want in fact for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.390
 understand the value of respecting 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.039
 mixing proportions 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.730
 we will realize a small 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 experience in three plaster mullahs 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 black that each contain 100 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 milliliters of water I add plaster 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.329
 in different proportions in the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 bowl number one I pour as much plaster 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 who unites it to back is 100 milliliters 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.020
 in the second game to 50 milliliters 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 plaster and in the third 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 25 milliliters I mix one after 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.680
 the other each of the bowls until get 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.990
 after a few minutes the mixture of 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.240
 first bowl begins to solidify the one 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.140
 of the 2nd thickens while the last 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 liquid remains 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 after a day of drying the bowl 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.680
 number one and bowl number 2 are 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.679
 solid 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.310
 the first bowl contained a mixture 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:34.030
 water so much water that plaster plaster 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.950
 solidify obtained and resistant one can 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.330
 touched him without problem he does not keep 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.220
 the stripes in the number two bowl the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.520
 obtained plaster is solid 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 however he sucks very easily 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.819
 it will be noticed that it keeps on the surface the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.500
 scratches while bowl number 3 him 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.630
 is still liquid 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.850
 we can therefore remember this 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.819
 experience that the more you add 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.429
 the water to your plaster minus this one will be 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.450
 robust 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.429
 here I hope this video you 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.200
 bring back something I tell you to 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.200
 very soon and stay creative
