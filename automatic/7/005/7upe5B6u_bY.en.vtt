00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.730 
least it's nice and small its compact
and<00:02:00.369> what<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:00.850> comes<00:02:01.090> with<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:02.530> right

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
and what this comes with is this right

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.920 
and what this comes with is this right
here<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.920> foam<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.970> we<00:02:04.119> use<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.420> prevent<00:02:04.570> wind

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
here this foam so we use to prevent wind

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.609 
here this foam so we use to prevent wind
noise<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:07.270> course<00:02:07.600> I'm<00:02:07.900> guessing<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.439> could

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
noise of course I'm guessing you could

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.130 
noise of course I'm guessing you could
probably<00:02:08.860> go<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.429> find<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.569> dead

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
probably go and find one of the dead

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.649 
probably go and find one of the dead
animal<00:02:11.500> looking<00:02:11.739> ones

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
animal looking ones

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.880 
animal looking ones
right<00:02:14.659> here<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:15.049> have<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> little<00:02:15.440> hot<00:02:15.620> shoe

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
right here we have the little hot shoe

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.149 
right here we have the little hot shoe
mount<00:02:16.540> us<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.780> course<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.170> mainly<00:02:18.409> plastic<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
mount us of course is mainly plastic a

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.300 
mount us of course is mainly plastic a
bit<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.640> metal<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.349> that's<00:02:21.349> kinda

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
bit of metal right here that's kinda

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.059 
bit of metal right here that's kinda
cruddy<00:02:22.670> quality<00:02:23.150> but<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.360> mean<00:02:23.830> for<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> price

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
cruddy quality but I mean for the price

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.509 
cruddy quality but I mean for the price
it's<00:02:25.280> great<00:02:25.659> I'm<00:02:26.659> it<00:02:26.840> works<00:02:27.019> great<00:02:27.290> too<00:02:27.519> it

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
it's great I'm it works great too it

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.500 
it's great I'm it works great too it
attaches<00:02:28.849> perfectly<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.450> a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
attaches perfectly and really it's a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.539 
attaches perfectly and really it's a
great<00:02:32.690> microphone<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.739> only<00:02:36.920> downside

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
great microphone so the only downside

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.729 
great microphone so the only downside
I'd<00:02:37.700> say<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:37.909> it<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.269> because<00:02:38.780> there<00:02:39.290> this

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
I'd say to it is because there this

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.449 
I'd say to it is because there this
cable<00:02:40.159> itself<00:02:40.400> feels<00:02:40.760> super<00:02:41.360> flimsy<00:02:41.569> um<00:02:42.530> like

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
cable itself feels super flimsy um like

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.100 
cable itself feels super flimsy um like
honestly<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:44.150> using<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.599> for<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.780> past<00:02:44.930> five

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
honestly just using it for the past five

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.390 
honestly just using it for the past five
minutes<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.470> worried<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.950> gonna<00:02:46.069> you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
minutes I'm worried that it's gonna you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.500 
minutes I'm worried that it's gonna you
know<00:02:47.269> break<00:02:47.920> tiny<00:02:48.920> bit<00:02:49.160> um<00:02:49.390> some<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.450> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
know break tiny bit um some of the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.780 
know break tiny bit um some of the
wiring<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:50.930> just<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.200> feels<00:02:51.379> really<00:02:51.799> flimsy

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
wiring it's just it feels really flimsy

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.619 
wiring it's just it feels really flimsy
and<00:02:53.030> kind<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.329> loose<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.660> not<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:55.120> guess<00:02:56.120> strong

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
and kind of loose and not I guess strong

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.259 
and kind of loose and not I guess strong
to<00:02:57.049> say<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.200> least<00:02:57.879> but<00:02:58.879> if<00:02:58.940> you're<00:02:59.120> using

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
to say the least but if you're using

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.699 
to say the least but if you're using
this<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.629> top<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.989> your<00:03:00.079> camera<00:03:00.379> you're<00:03:00.560> good

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
this on top of your camera you're good

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.289 
this on top of your camera you're good
but<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.010> can<00:03:01.159> also<00:03:01.280> use<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.819> some<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
but you can also use this some I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.539 
but you can also use this some I
connected<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.040> olympus

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
connected it to this little olympus

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.539 
connected it to this little olympus
recorder<00:03:04.700> here<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.659> audio<00:03:05.959> recorder<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:06.620> it

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
recorder here on audio recorder and it

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.550 
recorder here on audio recorder and it
works<00:03:07.700> great<00:03:07.849> on<00:03:08.000> all<00:03:08.120> devices<00:03:08.510> um<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.440> can

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
works great on all devices um you can

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.380 
works great on all devices um you can
probably<00:03:09.769> even<00:03:09.950> use<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.579> pc<00:03:11.209> as<00:03:11.359> a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
probably even use this on a pc as a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.500 
probably even use this on a pc as a
microphone<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.819> just<00:03:14.000> want<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.209> good

this<00:03:24.470> up<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.919> the<00:03:24.980> reason<00:03:25.819> for<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.000> is

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
this up on the reason for that is

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.479 
this up on the reason for that is
because<00:03:26.919> even<00:03:27.919> though<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.099> may<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.459> a

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
because even though you may not have a

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.159 
because even though you may not have a
DSLR<00:03:28.910> or<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.150> hot<00:03:29.359> shoe<00:03:29.540> mount<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.870> top<00:03:30.019> your

DSLR or a hot shoe mount on the top your

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.650 
DSLR or a hot shoe mount on the top your
camera<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:31.489> can<00:03:31.519> still<00:03:31.879> use<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.209> as<00:03:32.389> just<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
camera you can still use this as just a

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.180 
camera you can still use this as just a
regular<00:03:32.810> microphone<00:03:33.319> as<00:03:33.470> well<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:33.980> an

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
regular microphone as well you get an

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.580 
regular microphone as well you get an
extender<00:03:34.730> for<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.269> female<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.379> male

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
extender for this a female to male
