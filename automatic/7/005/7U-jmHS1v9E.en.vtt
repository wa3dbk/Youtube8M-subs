00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 street good as you can see this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 car will sound to some and others is not 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.210
 the car that good you in the video 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 this one that a lot of people did not like 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.250
 of my garage not the cars 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.930
 tuneados the garage and what we will 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 do is going to be running with this car 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.410
 It's good for you to see how the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.710
 only problem of this car 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 is that slides slides more than my mother 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.390
 that if this is ice it slips 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.460
 very much this car and good is one thing 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.620
 quite negative at the time of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.879
 run because if you do not see good if you do not see 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.140
 you do not see how mother calls me and I 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.340
 I hurt modem already correct 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 incredibly much is running this 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.239
 it runs too much but as I said 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.180
 bad is that it goes mount the music that I 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.330
 is bothering is that it skids a lot 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.269
 car or is taken is you take it for ass 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:01.239
 today if I advance you visit it advanced to me 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.239
 as correct I run more than the other 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.930
 ayayay good as my mother right 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.960
 we are already in chapter 2 is worth little 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 a little every Thursday as I said to the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.420
 wave 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 or I say it like I did every Thursday 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 between you get a little run in the mode 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 a player since good here I have 17 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 millions of dollars and good 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.830
 practically not used not a shame 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.440
 that there is no glitch that allows 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.380
 spend the player's light money at 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.990
 online but I've seen this better 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.939

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.950
 he overtook me one ahead of another 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.350
 my mother stop talking to all 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.869

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.220

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.200
 chapter 1 this time yes I'm not going to 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.240

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 good rod we will go braking not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.210
 practically what we're going to do goes 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 it stops by itself 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.310
 if we do not try it if you want 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.950
 those that you like this miniseries and if 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 I have time or I can find the car 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.200
 to tell me the cars you would like 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.240

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.190
 cars do not delay so I'll have you 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.410

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 cars we would like to see in the series and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 I will practically try to bring bring 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.580
 every Thursday we are not in the second 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.830
 back and I almost like that mother of mine 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 uy as correct 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.130
 very june yo yo yo yo yo 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.230
 uyuyuy good now so if this is what 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.240
 what happens to me always look what I say what 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.920
 I always say in any game of 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.040
 racing or in any game that has 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.390
 to run with a car or motorcycle always 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.940
 I go first and it's the last round 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.890
 I always get nervous and I always 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 I get nervous about that the first 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.420
 I ran second at the end because the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.840
 law and the law too 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.840
 so if I'm lucky I do not rapa the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.450
 car because if I rap to stroke or 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.520
 If I rap to the day I have here 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.459
 I do not think we 're going much 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.459
 car that you can come on come 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.610
 and that gets wet which is that I care if 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 I have to use what I use 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.220
 well thus avoided what is losing I'm going to 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.370
 use it in door two peppers 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.940

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.200

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.790
 I am already reaching the goal that I am 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.730
