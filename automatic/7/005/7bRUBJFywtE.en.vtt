00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 cross shot from left andre schurrle 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.099

 this year 2013 after a great feat 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.510
 personal and that cross-hit of the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 left andre schurrle a jose mourinho 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.690
 who saw the arrival andre schurrle well 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.980
 served in the 10th minute to register to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 opening the score for the blues 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 Chelsea's first striker scored at 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 outside in this year 2013 after a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 nice personal exploit and that typing 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.539
 crossed left andre schurrle a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.539
 people course and the corner with motorola 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.409
 and apple a4 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.869
 chained see how his kick 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.399
 stopped it is possible to mark the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.679
 side of this rate passes a team of 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.630
 chelsea way too much in the management of 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.369
 this short advantage 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.000
 epita roig 3 minutes from half time 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.000
 cherries 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.070
 goodbye here keep out that chance 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 2-2 Czech who is put on his line neither 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.970
 nor the duel crouch inheriting 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.580
 of a balloon that marks a forest of 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.040
 anthony legs you were you had 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 reason I did not believe stoke able to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.000
 score because I find that football 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.490
 is pretty pop that's actually a little 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.050
 short and the corner with pitaro the Apollo 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.180
 there it was necessary to control for floor 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.670
 see how are they stopped? 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.440
 it is possible to mark the side 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.420
 stopped if chelsea team a lot 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.539
 too much in the management of this short 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.350
 advantage and peter crouch at 3 minutes from 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.350
 the half-time that equalizes 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.600
 goodbye to look here a kind 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.300
 that they calm hazardously from cech who 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.550
 is put on his line neither nor on the duel 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.870
 crouch life that inherits a balloon that 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.930
 mark in an anthony leg forest 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.330
 you were you were right I thought 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 not this rate able to score because 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.300
 that I find that football is enough 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 poor its workforce sprint 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.120
 walters no fault on azpilicueta of 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.900
 nathalie walter and stephen island lake 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.670
 roig the other side the blonde 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.060
 you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.830
 the opening and stoke city that goes over 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.349
 one who would have thought 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.569
 it's now the potters who are 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.030
 leading in this match they would have been 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.040
 for 40 minutes extremely shy 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.810
 during the last five minutes of the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.100
 first half time and in space 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.530
 konami is only this second half time 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.610
 we see a beefy team ready to 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.069
 move mountains 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
 chelsea led 2-1 when the throws remain 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.580
 here watching the duel is won at the start 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.840
 there is a little wait-and-see attitude on the part of 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.720
 from terry not know whether to go there or 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.790
 not and then the a1 its brilliant because 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.610
 the look of a little bit what we 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.830
 does a layman here think not who is 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.660
 fake the balloon is given very quickly 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.920
 and art and india who called this pass 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.660
 take a chance left foot and go 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.100
 find the small net even the pole 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.260
 to beat peter cech 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.730
 it's totally unexpected from 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.420
 of a team that was unable to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.890
 score extremely shy during the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.690
 last five minutes of the first half 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.489
 time and in the first five minutes 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.870
 from this second half time to see a 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.970
 strong team 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.030
 topple mountains this one one is 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.020
 of 1066 watching the duel is earned 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.460
 departure there 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.050
 a bit of wait- and- see first terry 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.420
 do not know whether to go or not and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.430
 and then it's brilliant hand because the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.240
 look a little bit what makes us 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.590
 a layman here I do not think that's wrong the 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.510
 balloon is given very quickly and to 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.830
 reynolds who has a little space takes his 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
 luck left foot and will find the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.590
 small net even the pole to beat 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.720
 Peter Cech 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.190
 it's totally unexpected from 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.520
 of a team that was unable to 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.520
 to mark 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.530
 it was deviated but against the harpooner 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.990
 on the equalization andré on the and if 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.630
 this match was getting completely crazy at 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.760
 hardly three minutes after being mixed 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.770
 scandal to chelsea coming back from 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.770
 everywhere the doubled would have on the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.360
 it's still the best scenario 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.970
 which can be 6 pm on kicks 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.100
 stopped yes it's this raise and on 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.169
 the tale hamon saw on his feat 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.000
 previous one that we did not see during a 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.440
 half an hour and who takes the ball 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.550
 this side my left foot and a little 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.850
 of success that it goes into a 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.520
 forest of people here bad revival of the 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.520
 knee the defense of stockeu pillay 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.450
 it was deviated but countered the recovery on 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.030
 the andré equalization on the and if that 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.430
 match was getting completely crazy 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.530
 three minutes after being led to 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.420
 score this is chelsea coming back from 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.420
 everywhere the doubled andre schurrle 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.969
 it's still the best scenario 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.729
 possible for chelsea then on shots of 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.889
 foot stopped yes it is to have started on 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.929
 the conapp we saw on his exploit 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.759
 previous one that we have not seen during a 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.199
 half an hour and who takes the ball 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.339
 this complement of the left foot and capoue 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.610
 of success that it goes into a 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:48.279
 forest of people here bad revival of the 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.860
 game from where the defense to store pillay 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:55.300
 waiting this day judged that I judge island 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.849
 with assaidi followed the face and van duel 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.610
 hove and he will roll but hey he has the 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:04.759
 bend that goal to the united states that allows 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.150
 the 90th minute a carryover stock 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.819
 the advantage josé mourinho the blues on 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.530
 the is all knee down the other and 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.780
 sweet to buy side and then for now 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.780
 makes the difference in favor the potters 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.169
 what scenario what an unbelievable scenario 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.740
 in any case would not have bet on that 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.740
 close to half time 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.630
 after a yellow card at the top the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.220
 direction to watch this is his first 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.600
 rapaille just returned secular 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.360
 rocky it eliminates easily 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.730
 lucas side is superb it is a 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.200
 goal anyway beautiful with a 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.210
 defense completely to the picks because 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.680
 that there the defender and terry award 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.720
 behind is not going to cover on two 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.130
 still who can ride on him but 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.500
 they are taken for his ability to keep 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.110
 here band 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.570
 at the exit the lymph reminded absolutely 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.940
 sumptuous and we have a scenario 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.110
 incredible at emptiness after eight years at 7.1 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.630
 me history in more ways than one 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.160
 I told him then played in first the 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.160
 crocs samassa is saying and
