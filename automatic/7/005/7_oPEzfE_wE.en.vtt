you<00:03:21.600> think<00:03:21.660> you're<00:03:22.020> in<00:03:22.140> Clinton's<00:03:22.530> gonna<00:03:22.680> put

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
you think you're in Clinton's gonna put

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.290 
you think you're in Clinton's gonna put
together<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.250> something<00:03:23.490> like<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.790> well<00:03:24.240> I

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
together for something like this well I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.400 
together for something like this well I
don't<00:03:24.390> think<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> B<00:03:25.170> team

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
don't think it's going to be a B team

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
don't think it's going to be a B team
necessarily<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.070> think<00:03:26.280> obviously<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.760> MLS

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
necessarily I think obviously the MLS

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.160 
necessarily I think obviously the MLS
guys<00:03:27.270> are<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.600> be<00:03:27.690> there<00:03:27.840> some<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
guys are going to be there some of the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.480 
guys are going to be there some of the
Mexican<00:03:28.530> based<00:03:28.740> guys<00:03:28.950> are<00:03:29.100> going<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.310> there

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
Mexican based guys are going to be there

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.460 
Mexican based guys are going to be there
so<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.959> side

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
so it's going to be kind of a one a side

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.140 
so it's going to be kind of a one a side
for<00:03:31.680> Jurgen<00:03:31.980> Klinsmann<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.580> that's<00:03:32.940> good

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
for Jurgen Klinsmann and that's good

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.610 
for Jurgen Klinsmann and that's good
because<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.570> team<00:03:33.720> still<00:03:34.020> needs<00:03:34.050> some<00:03:34.380> depth

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because the team still needs some depth

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.199 
because the team still needs some depth
we've<00:03:34.830> seen<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.250> world<00:03:35.430> cup<00:03:35.640> qualifying<00:03:36.060> so

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
we've seen it in world cup qualifying so

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.699 
we've seen it in world cup qualifying so
I<00:03:36.240> think<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.690> an<00:03:36.990> important<00:03:37.380> tournament

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
I think this is an important tournament

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.290 
I think this is an important tournament
for<00:03:37.860> them<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.400> game<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.730> sticks<00:03:38.970> out<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.270> me

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
for them the game that sticks out to me

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.060 
for them the game that sticks out to me
is<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.870> Costa<00:03:40.200> Rica<00:03:40.440> game<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:40.920> even

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
is not the Costa Rica game not even

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.260 
is not the Costa Rica game not even
really<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.340> Belize<00:03:41.610> game<00:03:41.850> which<00:03:42.030> was<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
really the Belize game which was the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.180 
really the Belize game which was the
surprise<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> Gold<00:03:43.110> Cup<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.530> far<00:03:43.770> but<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
surprise of the Gold Cup so far but the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.740 
surprise of the Gold Cup so far but the
fact<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.880> US<00:03:45.060> has<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.300> go<00:03:45.390> up<00:03:45.420> against

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
fact that the US has to go up against

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.090 
fact that the US has to go up against
Cuba<00:03:46.080> which<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.350> really<00:03:46.590> kind<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.920> surprise

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
Cuba which is really kind of a surprise

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.310 
Cuba which is really kind of a surprise
team<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.910> CONCACAF<00:03:48.330> people<00:03:48.840> don't<00:03:48.959> think<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
team in CONCACAF people don't think that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.990 
team in CONCACAF people don't think that
anymore<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> baseball<00:03:50.520> country<00:03:50.670> right

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
