00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
by the way this isn't my car

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.800 
by the way this isn't my car
but<00:02:12.140> uh<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.740> think<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:13.970> okay<00:02:14.420> but<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.720> really

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
but uh I think it's okay but I really

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.100 
but uh I think it's okay but I really
didn't<00:02:15.770> really<00:02:16.670> didn't<00:02:16.880> pull<00:02:17.060> off<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.570> look<00:02:17.960> I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
didn't really didn't pull off the look I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.280 
didn't really didn't pull off the look I
was<00:02:18.290> trying<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:19.300> rattle<00:02:20.300> cans<00:02:20.570> probably

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
was trying for with rattle cans probably

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.620 
was trying for with rattle cans probably
would<00:02:22.100> have<00:02:22.220> done<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> lot<00:02:22.700> better<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:23.360> an

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
would have done a lot better with an

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.540 
would have done a lot better with an
airbrush<00:02:23.960> but<00:02:24.770> that's<00:02:24.950> okay<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> don't<00:02:25.340> have

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
airbrush but that's okay I don't have

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.400 
airbrush but that's okay I don't have
any<00:02:25.700> airbrush<00:02:26.030> paint<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.900> just<00:02:27.230> about

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
any airbrush paint so this is just about

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.750 
any airbrush paint so this is just about
done<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:27.830> as<00:02:28.220> far<00:02:28.490> as<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.740> overall

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
done now as far as the the overall

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.910 
done now as far as the the overall
vehicle<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:32.240> concerned<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:33.320> need<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.620> put<00:02:33.830> in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
vehicle is concerned just need to put in

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.130 
vehicle is concerned just need to put in
the<00:02:34.070> battery<00:02:34.640> hold-down<00:02:35.060> straps<00:02:35.210> which<00:02:35.960> are

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the battery hold-down straps which are

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.770 
the battery hold-down straps which are
also<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:37.040> covered<00:02:37.460> in<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> manual<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.450> far<00:02:38.630> as

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
also not covered in the manual as far as

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.020 
also not covered in the manual as far as
I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.900> see<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.250> need<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.430> hook<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
I can see and then I need to hook up the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.510 
I can see and then I need to hook up the
electronics<00:02:41.540> make<00:02:42.080> sure<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.650> figure<00:02:43.400> out

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
electronics make sure that I figure out

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.430 
electronics make sure that I figure out
a<00:02:43.550> way<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> get<00:02:44.240> all<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.720> fit<00:02:44.960> under<00:02:45.320> this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
a way to get all that to fit under this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.980 
a way to get all that to fit under this
body<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:46.310> plenty<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.700> room<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.090> ESC<00:02:47.690> but

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
body just plenty of room for the ESC but

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.460 
body just plenty of room for the ESC but
then<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.100> receiver<00:02:50.320> hopefully<00:02:51.320> I'll<00:02:51.440> be

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
then for the receiver hopefully I'll be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.770 
then for the receiver hopefully I'll be
able<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.830> figure<00:02:52.340> out<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.550> way<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.730> put<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.630> down

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
able to figure out a way to put it down

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.910 
able to figure out a way to put it down
on<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.140> floor<00:02:54.560> up<00:02:54.890> front<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.770> gonna

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
on the floor up front and then I'm gonna

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.190 
on the floor up front and then I'm gonna
get<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.310> I'll<00:02:58.700> calibrate<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.450> up<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.840> it'll<00:03:00.080> be

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
get it I'll calibrate it up and it'll be

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.830 
get it I'll calibrate it up and it'll be
time<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.470> hit<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.980> track<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:02.150> guy<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.420> ready

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
time to hit the track this guy is ready

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.600 
time to hit the track this guy is ready
to<00:03:03.020> go<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.410> thanks<00:03:03.740> for<00:03:03.830> watching<00:03:03.890> these<00:03:04.280> build
