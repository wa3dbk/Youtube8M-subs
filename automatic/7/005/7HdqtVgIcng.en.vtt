00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.040

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:10.070

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.679
 new free game and nexus one that is 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.010
 completely free 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.770
 I do not know how long the game has 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.450
 network but already has a little time 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.560
 they passed me the data has two days 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.740
 they bought the data and had not had 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.480
 chance to record it but then here are the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.280
 I bring you to download all the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.830
 people who have the one already know that I 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.010
 like to go up so different variety of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.960
 which games for example that are free or 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.760
 game high development game that we 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.010
 would be a little more than the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.050
 gameplay as always so we're going to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.239
 game store and then we go to the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.440
 category of all the games and we 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.450
 let's go to the bottom of us - it's not 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.470
 completely to the bottom they will pass 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.980

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.339
 spark this game is free 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.920
 to how I was seeing it right now because 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 I'm just not realizing that it's not going to 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.990
 download weighs 2 gigabytes point 86 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.400
 mb 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.400
 already put a purchase 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.380
 if you are loading the fart so that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 see that no scam is installing and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.660
 torpedo so that they see more or 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.900
 less than what it is according to here says 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.240
 what can you do your world quoted that breastplate 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 I was watching one of mario bros wii yo 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 get the copyright why 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.190
 according to copyright of turf but 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.650
 you can create all these worlds and for 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.860
 example there is the world of mario the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.070
 of number two if I remember correctly the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.300
 world and everyone in mission 2 coming 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.300
 being 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.280
 and then nothing or it looks good the game does not 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.490
 I know if there are more maps I'm going to put in 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.110
