don't<00:01:33.250> really<00:01:33.909> build<00:01:34.479> things<00:01:34.810> like<00:01:35.020> this

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
don't really build things like this

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.249 
don't really build things like this
anymore<00:01:35.700> we've<00:01:36.700> been<00:01:36.909> designing<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.840> art<00:01:37.990> for

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
anymore we've been designing the art for

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.859 
anymore we've been designing the art for
over<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> year<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:39.130> took<00:01:39.640> us<00:01:39.880> six<00:01:40.270> months<00:01:40.630> to

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
over a year it took us six months to

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.980 
over a year it took us six months to
build<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.380> complete<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.990> scaffolding

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
build and to complete the scaffolding

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.320 
build and to complete the scaffolding
you<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.259> right<00:01:44.409> here<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.950> what<00:01:45.460> was<00:01:45.610> used<00:01:45.909> by

and sticks and leaves that we used to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.120 
and sticks and leaves that we used to
seal<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.659> ark<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.990> idea<00:01:56.290> being<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:57.009> was

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130
