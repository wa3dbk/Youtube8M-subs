00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
BIOS now first of all what actually is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.130 
BIOS now first of all what actually is
your<00:00:26.550> BIOS<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.510> computer

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
about the system clock it's about how

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
about the system clock it's about how

faster<00:01:11.610> than<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> normally<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.110> make

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
faster than it normally would but make

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310 
faster than it normally would but make
sure<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.070> heed<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.430> warning<00:01:14.790> later<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
sure you heed my warning later on so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
sure you heed my warning later on so
let's<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> look<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
let's take a look at how to do it so the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.890 
let's take a look at how to do it so the
time<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> access<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:20.340> BIOS<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
time to access your BIOS is just as the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
time to access your BIOS is just as the

computer on the Dell computer here you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.630 
computer on the Dell computer here you
do<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:29.970> pressing<00:01:30.240> f2<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.159> other

operate or on other computers there are
different<00:01:35.159> ways<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> getting<00:01:35.490> into<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> BIOS

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
different ways of getting into the BIOS

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
different ways of getting into the BIOS
it's<00:01:37.799> best<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> Google<00:01:38.820> search<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it's best to have a Google search to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
it's best to have a Google search to
find<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.189> quite<00:01:41.909> frequently

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
find out what they are quite frequently

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.530 
find out what they are quite frequently

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
we were talking about earlier on which
is<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> boot<00:01:59.579> sequence<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.780> example<00:02:01.290> here

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is the boot sequence so for example here

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
is the boot sequence so for example here
it's<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.729> from<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> hard<00:02:03.210> disk

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
it's going to be from the hard disk

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's going to be from the hard disk
drive<00:02:03.630> first<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.159> were<00:02:05.280> installing

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
drive first of all if we were installing

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.490 
drive first of all if we were installing
a<00:02:05.790> new<00:02:05.820> operating<00:02:06.299> system<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.259> want<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a new operating system we would want to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.180 
a new operating system we would want to
make<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> boot

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
make it boot

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
make it boot
from<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.400> CD<00:02:08.850> Drive<00:02:08.880> first<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.900> all<00:02:10.020> other

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
from the CD Drive first of all other

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.530 
from the CD Drive first of all other
things<00:02:10.980> that<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.460> have<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> look<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.120> are

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
things that you can have a look at are

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
things that you can have a look at are
which<00:02:12.720> hard-disk<00:02:13.140> drives<00:02:13.470> are<00:02:13.650> installed<00:02:13.770> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
which hard-disk drives are installed and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.540 
which hard-disk drives are installed and
your<00:02:15.030> onboard<00:02:15.780> devices<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.490> I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
your onboard devices and so on but I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.680 
your onboard devices and so on but I
think<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.820> get<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> idea<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.630> really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
think you get the idea it's really

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
think you get the idea it's really
low-level<00:02:19.400> configuration<00:02:20.400> stuff<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.120> we're

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
low-level configuration stuff that we're

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.900 
low-level configuration stuff that we're
looking<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.780> here<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:23.220> word<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.670> warning

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
looking at here now one word of warning

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.840 
looking at here now one word of warning
some<00:02:24.720> biases<00:02:25.320> let<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.800> tamper<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.580> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
some biases let you tamper with and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.880 
some biases let you tamper with and
fiddle<00:02:27.210> with<00:02:27.240> all<00:02:27.480> kinds<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.140> settings<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
fiddle with all kinds of settings and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.160 
fiddle with all kinds of settings and
it's<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.820> dangerous<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.020> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it's really dangerous to do that if you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.810 
it's really dangerous to do that if you
don't<00:02:31.350> know<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.800> you're<00:02:31.980> doing<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.430> always

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
don't know what you're doing I always

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.520 
don't know what you're doing I always
make<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> note<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.690> what<00:02:33.930> settings<00:02:34.350> I'm

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
make a note of what settings I'm

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.440 
make a note of what settings I'm
changing<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.490> were<00:02:35.550> before<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> change

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
changing what they were before I change

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.190 
changing what they were before I change
them<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.810> case<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> computer<00:02:37.860> doesn't<00:02:38.100> quite
