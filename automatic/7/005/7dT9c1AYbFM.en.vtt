00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
perimeter of the bell housing I've got a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
perimeter of the bell housing I've got a
jack<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> support<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
jack in here now to support the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
jack in here now to support the
transmission<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> crossmember<00:01:38.700> I'm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
transmission by the crossmember I'm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
transmission by the crossmember I'm
gonna<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.450> ahead<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.600> pull<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> four<00:01:40.229> bolts

gonna go ahead and pull the four bolts

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
gonna go ahead and pull the four bolts
on<00:01:40.710> either<00:01:40.860> side<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> crossmember<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
on either side of this crossmember so I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
on either side of this crossmember so I
can<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.689> transmission<00:01:43.229> lower<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can get this transmission lower down and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
can get this transmission lower down and
get<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.880> hardware<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.720> little

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
get some of this hardware a little

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.429 
get some of this hardware a little
easier

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
easier

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
alright so I've got the crossmember out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
alright so I've got the crossmember out
I'll<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.140> ahead<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> transmission

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
I'll go ahead and put the transmission

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.109 
I'll go ahead and put the transmission
hanging<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
hanging down a little bit here and that
