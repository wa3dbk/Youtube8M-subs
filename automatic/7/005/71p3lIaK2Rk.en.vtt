tank tops with a big graphic on the
front<00:00:20.789> sort<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.500> I'm

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
front sort of like this one that I'm

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640 
front sort of like this one that I'm
wearing<00:00:22.980> right<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.699> paid<00:00:24.420> $20<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.320> this

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
wearing right now I paid $20 for this

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.179 
wearing right now I paid $20 for this
which<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.369> realize<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.300> lot<00:00:28.019> more<00:00:28.710> than<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
which I realize is a lot more than I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.769 
which I realize is a lot more than I
probably<00:00:29.340> should<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.730> paid<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.539> know

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
probably should have paid because I know

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
probably should have paid because I know
I<00:00:30.929> could<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.349> something<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.790> way

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I could make something like this for way

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.560 
I could make something like this for way
cheaper<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:34.530> did<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.390> going

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
cheaper and I actually did so I'm going

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
cheaper and I actually did so I'm going
to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.690> showing<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> how<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.350> made<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.219> exact

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
shirt this cost me probably eight

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.729 
shirt this cost me probably eight

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
paint was like three dollars so it's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920

shirt that you're going to be stenciling

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
shirt that you're going to be stenciling
so<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> first<00:01:22.770> step<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.939> is

so the first step that you want to do is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
so the first step that you want to do is
just<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.200> stencil<00:01:25.890> print<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
just take your stencil print out and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.170 
just take your stencil print out and
then<00:01:27.299> put<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.290> piece<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> freezer<00:01:29.070> paper<00:01:29.430> over

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
then put a piece of freezer paper over

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.130 
then put a piece of freezer paper over
top<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.200> trace<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.280> pattern<00:01:32.729> onto

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
top and then just trace the pattern onto

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:47.859 
top and then just trace the pattern onto
the<00:01:34.140> dull<00:01:34.799> side<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.729> freezer<00:01:36.030> paper

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.919 

once<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.770> have<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.549> pattern<00:01:50.179> all<00:01:50.390> traced<00:01:50.780> out

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
once you have the pattern all traced out

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.419 
once you have the pattern all traced out
onto<00:01:51.259> your<00:01:51.289> freezer<00:01:51.619> paper<00:01:51.829> you're<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
onto your freezer paper you're going to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.069 
onto your freezer paper you're going to
want<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.670> cut<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.000> out<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.450> put<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> piece<00:01:53.929> of

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
want to cut it out I put a piece of

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.599 
want to cut it out I put a piece of
cardboard<00:01:54.469> underneath<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.460> would<00:01:55.520> be

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
cardboard underneath just so it would be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.440 
cardboard underneath just so it would be
easier<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.149> cut<00:01:56.840> out<00:02:00.579> be<00:02:01.579> really<00:02:01.880> careful<00:02:02.270> when

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
easier to cut out be really careful when

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.880 
easier to cut out be really careful when
you're<00:02:02.600> cutting<00:02:02.960> out<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.619> stencil

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
you're cutting out is the stencil

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.760 
you're cutting out is the stencil
because<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.549> don't<00:02:04.729> want<00:02:05.090> an<00:02:05.390> errant<00:02:05.899> slash

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
because you don't want an errant slash

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.030 
because you don't want an errant slash
somewhere<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.579> paint<00:02:08.030> will<00:02:08.179> bleed<00:02:08.390> through

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.550 

so<00:02:13.040> yeah<00:02:13.190> here<00:02:13.580> I'm<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.910> carefully<00:02:14.660> taking

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
so yeah here I'm just carefully taking

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:31.000 
so yeah here I'm just carefully taking
out<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.250> pieces

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.380 

once<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.340> stencil<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:33.000> cut<00:02:33.360> out

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
once you have your stencil all cut out

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.530 
once you have your stencil all cut out
take<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> piece<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.710> cardboard<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.390> put<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
take the piece of cardboard and put it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
take the piece of cardboard and put it
in<00:02:36.660> between<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.110> layers<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.190> fabric<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> your

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
in between the layers of fabric of your

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.940 
in between the layers of fabric of your
shirts<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.750> when<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> paint

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
shirts because when you put the paint

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.140 
shirts because when you put the paint
all<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> don't<00:02:41.430> want<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> bleed

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
all and you don't want it to bleed

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
all and you don't want it to bleed
through<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> other<00:02:42.750> side<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.680> way

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
through to the other side so this way

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.100 
through to the other side so this way
it'll<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.150> bleed<00:02:45.360> onto<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.810> cardboard

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
it'll just bleed onto the cardboard

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
it'll just bleed onto the cardboard
instead<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.160> other<00:02:47.310> side<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> shirt

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
instead of the other side of the shirt

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
instead of the other side of the shirt
the<00:02:48.870> next<00:02:49.110> thing<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.710> want<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.130> is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the next thing that you want to do is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.940 
the next thing that you want to do is
take<00:02:50.820> your<00:02:51.030> stencil<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.780> put<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.140> shiny<00:02:52.620> side

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
take your stencil and put it shiny side

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.880

stencil<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.760> then<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.030> take<00:02:57.480> an<00:02:58.140> iron

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
stencil to be and then you take an iron

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.980 
stencil to be and then you take an iron
that's<00:02:58.920> heated<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.820> to<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.390> highest<00:03:00.660> setting

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that's heated up to the highest setting

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.530 
that's heated up to the highest setting
it'll<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.530> without<00:03:01.980> stain<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.730> without<00:03:03.240> steam

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
it'll go without stain the without steam

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.980 
it'll go without stain the without steam
Park<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.900> important<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.280> ya<00:03:06.210> take<00:03:06.630> your<00:03:06.780> iron

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
Park is important so ya take your iron

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.710 
Park is important so ya take your iron
and<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.500> put<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.430> onto<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> stencil<00:03:09.390> like

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and just put it onto the stencil like

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.280 
and just put it onto the stencil like
that<00:03:09.960> it'll<00:03:10.380> melt<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.220> plastic<00:03:11.820> side<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that it'll melt that plastic side so the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.990 
that it'll melt that plastic side so the
paint<00:03:13.560> won't<00:03:13.800> play<00:03:14.040> through<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.580> edges

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
paint won't play through to the edges

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.690 
paint won't play through to the edges
it's<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.410> important<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.160> iron<00:03:17.400> is

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
it's really important that your iron is

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's really important that your iron is
hot<00:03:17.880> enough

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
hot enough

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.480 
hot enough
otherwise<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.780> won't<00:03:18.900> adhere<00:03:19.260> nicely<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.460> can

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
otherwise it won't adhere nicely you can

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.300 
otherwise it won't adhere nicely you can
see<00:03:20.850> me<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.300> couple<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.840> areas<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.710> really

see me in a couple of areas just really
going<00:03:23.580> over<00:03:23.850> parts<00:03:24.210> that<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.870> aren't

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
going over parts that I think aren't

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.690 
going over parts that I think aren't
adhere<00:03:25.980> nicely<00:03:26.420> I'm<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:28.050> press<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.250> down<00:03:29.370> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
adhere nicely I'm I press up and down in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.210 
adhere nicely I'm I press up and down in
some<00:03:29.910> areas<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.330> make<00:03:30.660> sure<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.260> it's

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
some areas to make sure that it's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.970 
some areas to make sure that it's
pressed<00:03:32.910> down<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.270> really<00:03:34.080> really<00:03:34.350> secure

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
pressed down and really really secure

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.670 
pressed down and really really secure
and<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.260> applying<00:03:38.040> paint<00:03:39.050> onto<00:03:40.050> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and now I'm just applying paint onto the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.430 
and now I'm just applying paint onto the
shirt<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.420> I'm<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.989> starting<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
shirt and I'm going and starting at the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.440 
shirt and I'm going and starting at the
edges<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.670> really<00:03:45.030> make<00:03:45.270> sure

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
edges just so I can really make sure

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.710 
edges just so I can really make sure
that<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.930> edges<00:03:46.350> are<00:03:47.090> really<00:03:48.090> put<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.360> there<00:03:48.570> I

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that the edges are really put in there I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.050 
that the edges are really put in there I
found<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.320> dabbing<00:03:50.190> was<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> lot<00:03:50.550> easier<00:03:50.730> than

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
found that dabbing was a lot easier than

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.800 
found that dabbing was a lot easier than
sort<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.750> painting<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:53.480> once<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.600> have<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
sort of painting it on once you have the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.390 
sort of painting it on once you have the
whole<00:03:54.989> thing<00:03:55.230> done<00:03:55.470> remove<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.160> stencil

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
whole thing done remove the stencil

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.690 
whole thing done remove the stencil
while<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.330> paint<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.810> still<00:03:58.290> wet<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:59.070> it'll

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
while the paint is still wet that it'll

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550 
while the paint is still wet that it'll
be<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> lot<00:04:00.090> easier<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> move<00:04:00.810> while<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> paint

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
be a lot easier to move while the paint

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:11.540 
be a lot easier to move while the paint
is<00:04:01.680> still<00:04:01.739> wet

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.730
