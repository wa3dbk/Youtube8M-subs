 go back to watch the video those who have 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.240
 seen and those that are not the most 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.240
 because the stream and we did it at night and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.450

 you can see and that you comment on what you 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.549
 like the way to comment what we 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.250
 like the way to comment that you think 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.019
 that the cameras of the players leave 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.849
