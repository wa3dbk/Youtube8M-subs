 reflects from what's known to year 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.350
 back we wrote a script and which 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 just automated our work 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.740
 Now this script attracted 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 attention already 35 thousand specialists in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 traffic then in retargeting and now 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.229
 working today at the conference in if 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.100
 to my Siberia, I partially told it 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.409
 but if in short it works on advertising 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.579
 users who are simultaneously worth 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 in 3 small name is alive not stranded 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.409
 communities on one subject further 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 advertising is for those who 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.530
 just having just entered some 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.530
 communities on a given topic and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.750
 advertising for those who comment on the repost 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 laykaet wherein each type of such a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.850
 data but what is your own approach 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.670
 talk about it for a long time 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.439
 master class tomorrow which will be maxim 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.829
 organized we will hide on it 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.950
 to pronounce that is retargeting is 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.720
 social networks 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 steel all have and we have such a trend 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.280
 which we have asked more and more 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.020
 people join in terms of how 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.730
 infrastructure would be a lot of things 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.310
 worked out and inside by retargeting 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.260
 and tell me whether you are planning 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.629
 expand your service to others 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.569
 social networks first we finish 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.209
 some work with the contact so that 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.760
 We were satisfied with the support service and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.790
 so on after that we will 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.610
 engaging classmates very hour 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 ask about instagram and facebook we and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.750
 they were watched by him but there absolutely 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.910
 no interest most likely these 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 social networks we generally will not take about the account 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.580
 so tell me who is your user and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.280
 how difficult is it for a beginner to master your 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.810
 service but if 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.849
 generalized to say he is ours 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.310
 users are the people who need 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.810
 traffic from the internet if more difficult then 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.540
 I will separately separate several segments 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.989
 that's how difficult it is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.209
 use we have prescribed a huge 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.750
 number of algorithms working with our 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.670
 service 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.080
 we have registered a huge number of cases 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.269
 from us from our users 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080
 we have video documentation 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.769
 documentation 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.260
 examples of work that is, if a person wants 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.510
 nobody has everything for him 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.459
 opportunities are being sawn very often 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.430
 speaking in Moscow tell felix you 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.319
 how often do you perform in regions in 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.319
 January month we prescribed 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.290
 plan of all events of all ufa 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.280
 events that concern 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.920
 Internet industries have chosen us 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.889
 interesting and filed applications and in this 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.159
 the moment we have somewhere one two performances 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:04:01.310
 a week if someone wants to 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:04.230
 community there could not only me 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.849
 technical support person 3 will PR with 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.849
