00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.730
 and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.529
 now here player 2 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.080
 as a download online a simulator 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.210
 battle as you can say your 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 Personalized equipment completely and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 they played to find other manufacturers 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.200
 from all over the world you can also record 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.619
 the battle and with a program of 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.619
 recording 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.289
 on-line 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.350
 for windows or linux 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.090
 hard 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.250
 first from timbúes 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.259
 and here you have your entry avatar 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.689
 much your name that appeared 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 in online a lot of category that's already 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 issue of reading categories each 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.829
 pokemon that each because to show the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.829
 highest category or first-rate pokemon 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.829
 category 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:45.439
 carefully here afterwards is 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.439
 information what he puts when the good 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.209
 now go scam 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:06.930
 it's a matter of seeing the list 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.930
 you can look for it if you want for example 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 chubs 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:18.760
 directly for example since all 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 the generations 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:33.590
 you can improve skills but have 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:36.379
 a special attack defense that has 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.400
 much for example the health point to 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:43.239
 butt and I do not know there is a fault like two 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.239
 hanging points 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.409
 quite looking for example if I 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.040
 I want him to give me more defense I have more 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.939
 attack 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.939
 of souls 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:29.750
 and giving by name water 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:44.129
 generation is learned in what ways and by 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:48.470
 states and because the pp has the 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:52.520
 120 power 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.800
 and this is the aim but here you have 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.220
 the category of physical attacks of 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.220
 Contact 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.860
 against 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.940
 54 you can even have an attack 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.260
 and then we're going to be apart from 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.260
 here 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.490
 in the post 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:12.670
 and if in the course on one in English 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 here 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.000
 the amount that goes to see your 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.190
 opponent and you in combat 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.930
 and have the object that the pir has done 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.000
 normally almost everyone will be caught 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.129
 remains that each turn by pop was a 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.139
 little good 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:40.659
 and that and finally this from here to two 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.239
 points of the type that is hidden power 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.269
 because depending on strategy 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:47.860
 example soon we program a 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:50.800
 combat in which you have multiplexing with 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.800
 a plant type point and why because 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.629
 if they take us out to a pokémon type water that 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.039
 it is good much to fire or kind of type 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.259
 land that also good against fire 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.989
 then we have the taste of water type 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.880
 this type of plants this type mounted and 

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:14.380
 that's because we depend on strategy 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.380
 then I have here a team I think 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.630
 pokémon its description in English and its 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.880
 skills that is expressed in Spanish its 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.409
 mystic put here have everything because 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.869
 to see everything 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.519
 I do not use it much either and now that 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:36.950
 you want already fighting against another 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:40.660
 medal equipment close 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:44.440
 and in the variable software 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.430
 and here or else they will oppose then yes 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.880
 load 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.060
 the servers the players and I 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.060
 usually 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.650
 twice and here we are with all the 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.620
 players 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.570
 If I go here, there's a battle for 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.240
 example to see the battle that trinh 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.870
 against tito 11 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:16.450
 and here you can see the battle 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.450
 about a type 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.110
 if you want and team 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.950
 directly 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.970
 and this is without a doubt the explanation 

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.150
 soon we will explain how to record 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.090
 a battle like to reproduce it and 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.490
 record it to upload to youtube or 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.670
 other type of video pages while 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:13.290
 gone everything if you like we can subscribe and 

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.290
