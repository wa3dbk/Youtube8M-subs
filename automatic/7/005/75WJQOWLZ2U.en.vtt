00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 national team and I have you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.690

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.690
 compiled intensive exercises 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.390
 this week is about exercise 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.250
 a variant 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.780
 i always plan on doing exercises 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.700
 said to always look at the ball 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.900
 look forward now we take the ball 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 to do the third exercise coordination and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.699
 Reaction react twice to the ball 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.100
 we have already done it once before 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.010
 always with his back to me and up 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:22.540
 my signals reacted then we lay down 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 los we stay very well and although 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.060
 him very well 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.760
 right best starts slowly 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 Do this exercise this exercise 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.380
 always look very simple but you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.120
 First of all, you have to find your way around 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.190
 must find the right coordination 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.780
 because you have to look forward because 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.760
 this time the ball is here you can me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 look at his feet and may as well 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.850
 Not 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.610
 Left 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:25.030
 right and break you have the exercise 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.760
 It is very important to see that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.410
 details of trainers to ensure 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.280
 again a clean execution entirely 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.980
 clear on the ball then pay attention to the ball 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.810
 go to the ball exclusively and also 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.010
 command give it to defend players 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.010
