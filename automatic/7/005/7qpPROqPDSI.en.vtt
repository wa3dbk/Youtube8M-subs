00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
using formspring soon because it I just

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.760 
using formspring soon because it I just
don't<00:01:06.639> really<00:01:06.850> like<00:01:06.999> it<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:07.359> much<00:01:07.389> anymore<00:01:07.770> but

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.899 
don't really like it as much anymore but
I<00:01:08.829> thought<00:01:09.189> it<00:01:09.340> would<00:01:09.429> make<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.729> big

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
