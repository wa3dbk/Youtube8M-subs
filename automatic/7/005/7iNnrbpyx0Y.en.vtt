00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.069
cars dot com auto review I'm bill Jackson were here

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.710
the 2010 mazdaspeed3 its gotta 263
horsepower engine

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.849
a six-speed manual transmission and
several other features that you're going

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.740
to want to check out

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.039
if you're in the market for small fast
cash back now living with sp3 there's

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.869
one thing you can order throughout the
back its kinda loud gotta

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.720
loud exhaust you don't hear a lot road
noise up in the cabin

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.140
I don't think that's a bad thing I think
it's in your governor like this but for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590
those things are going to want to check
out on a test drive to make sure you can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.280
live with like we said it's gotta 263
horsepower engine it's actually a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.190
turbocharged four-cylinder engine

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.200
but there's very little lag actually
gets up and goes very well

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.969
it's also very well matched to a
six-speed manual transmission that not a

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.750
lot of fun here

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.860
for two years and wondered if she'd be
in second and third just matched up very

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.370
nicely

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.030
finally the scary is very good %uh got a
nice but a boost for you driver a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.680
parking lot boasting

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
by it doesn't get too whittier
high-speed the related homered

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.140
now our test car came with my sis tech
package and what you get with that is a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.890
sexy

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.840
changer in this navigation system known
for southern Spain I was a little

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.560
skeptical I was worried that it would be
too small to read

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.860
it's not also wondered about the
placement that actually I really like

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.350
that it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.290
in your line of sight but it's not
distracting and it's not too big and it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.360
doesn't draw your I was really looking
at the road finally though I was really

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.259
were devote actually be able to input

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.299
in the addresses and services nobody's
here so little out on the steering wheel

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.299
but that actually print turned out to be
quite easy I'm actually

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.520
in the system now like we said this is a
practical carts a hatchback

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.729
there's a nice as cargo area here it's
perfect for grocery runs things like

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.960
that I think you could fit a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.479
couple golf bags and they're pretty
easily unfortunate only

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.180
sorta Pratt or does have four doors
which in theory means you can carry four

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.659
adult

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.860
Visual C++ I have a seat where I would
have a and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.710
arm yeah it's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.579
just not gonna do it now

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.420
the regular mazda3 is a pretty fun car
to drive but the speed three think

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.819
that's a whole nother level

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.239
I think if you're considering a car like
a silver WRX for Volkswagen GTI

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.349
you should really carve out some time to
test drive this car

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.349
it's a it's solid entrant in the field
of small fast fun hatchbacks
