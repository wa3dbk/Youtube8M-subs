00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
we're doing also sponsorship work and I
say<00:00:53.940> something's<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.420> look<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
say something's gonna look like it is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
say something's gonna look like it is
from<00:00:55.230> overhead<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> might<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.579> quite

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
from overhead and it might be a quite

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.330 
from overhead and it might be a quite
complicated<00:00:57.390> design<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> peace<00:00:59.160> of
