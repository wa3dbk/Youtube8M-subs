00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 and youtube today I share 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 how to make a bird feeder 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 recycled or a fairy house 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 for girls 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810
 and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.030
 first rinse wrings and dries very well 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.610
 your boat yes your boat has a mouth like 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 this with a knife or cutter is the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 let's remove in this way with a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 marker or pencil you will draw a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.800
 Little gate can be on all four sides 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.830
 of the boat but preferably in these 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.760
 sides where the part that joins up 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.760
 it is towards the front 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.950
 If you want to hang on the wall not 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.950
 do opening in the back 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.490
 here I will draw a big remember 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:02:06.070
 draw it about five centimeters above 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:02:12.280
 from the base of the boat on the sides I will draw 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.980
 small rectangles and in this I will leave the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.810
 back part without cuts the one 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 we draw first will be the front of the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.910
 house with the cutter we cut it except 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.820
 from the top eye when the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.190
 Do cuts calmly and very slowly 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.380
 from top to bottom as if sawed 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.790
 because if you do the cut often you 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 you will pass and cut the rest 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.290
 what is left we doubled it up 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.739
 we cut a little and we folded the edge 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.590
 so that we stay like a kind of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.590
 so we cut out the other 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.669
 now it makes a small horizontal cut 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.590
 under each poet and there you place 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.109
 a stick of palette that must remain 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:20.079
 on the outside this so that the little birds 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:21.969
 can stop there and eat if you notice that 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.709
 they are very loose or move a lot 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:31.060
 hold the inside with a little 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:32.829
 tape on the top you will make a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.049
 pierce and we will place a thread or 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.049
 wire this will be to hang it 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.500
 the next thing is to paint the whole boat of 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.600
 one color or those that are fairer or 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.370
 of those that you like most probably 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.160
 you have to put several layers of paint 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.340
 to cover everything so when 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:29.090
 put a wait that dries and returns to 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:31.580
 paint as it is painted and very dry 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.920
 follow the decoration you can draw 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.960
 details with permanent markers or 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.300
 with acrylic paints decorate with 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.640
 strips beads stickers and so on 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.780
 there are countless ways according to your 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.780
 likes do not forget 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.439
 when you have finished painting and 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:32.050
 decorating is time to stick the sticks 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.869
 of palette as roof or roof of the house 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.659
 taking advantage of the shape of the boat you go to 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:41.369
 place liquid silicone or glue 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.369
 plentiful contact here 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.950
 and here 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.150
 and we will cut out the sticks 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.530
 pay attention that they do not stand out much 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.700
 this tab to paste the same 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.700
 those on the other side 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:17.360
 since they are well stuck he paints the 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.190
 you want to cover this part of here short 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.190
 a triangle of the same size and paste it 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.830
 finally do not forget to cover all the 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.770
 box with an island varnish ko protector of 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.380
 paint because we will have it outside and so 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.150
 if it gets wet a little it will not be anything if 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:42.860
 you can not use two or three 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:45.050
 layers of white glue and we have ready 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.020
 finished now just place them food 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.150
 for birds or bread crumbs and hangs 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.310
 in your garden and wait for them to come 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.310
 the little birds to eat bye
