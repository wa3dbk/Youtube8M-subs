00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome to with ay 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.130
 and here I bring you another video guys and 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.260
 this time I bring you a new glitch 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.570
 really amazing or to me it seems very 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.670
 useful for survival that allows us 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.500
 change slabs of any material by 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.000
 any other since I mean with 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.380
 this imagine that we have a lot of 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.439
 wooden slabs we could 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.849
 change them by sandstone by brick by 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.289
 stone brick any other 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.330
 material that is much more difficult to 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.800
 get that for example the wood well 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.180
 that this would be the invention and these are 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.740
 all the materials by which 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.570
 we can change those wooden slabs 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.800
 as I tell you now we will see how it works 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.600
 and how the invention is built but 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.969
 first I will show you how it works 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.800
 so that you see it because really 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.329
 I'm really good, for example, I've taken 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.739
 wooden slabs I tell you that you can 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.270
 do with any type of slab what 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.489
 we could better make pebble slabs 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.469
 of wood swap but me 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.120
 it seems simpler what we are going to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.530
 to do is come here to put some slabs in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 certain position we are going to put a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 red stone torch above and now 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 we are going to go to this area we are going to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.600
 choose the material for which we want 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.879
 change those wooden slabs for example 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.470
 stone slabs and we're going to go where 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.940
 we had left the material and here 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100
 we will have our new block that 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.320
 breaking it will give us two slabs of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.030
 material that we have chosen we can 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.400
 Do it again as many times as you want 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.770
 another two slabs and we will choose 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.330
 example brick slabs that could 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.890
 be a little more complicated to get 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.720
 ok so we just go back here 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.580
 we take our brick slabs and we 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.110
 we have it this can serve us for 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.150
 exchange as you see any 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.680
 material and although they are slabs we can 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.420
 make complete blocks with them like this 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.710
 that could be quite interesting already 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.119
 that in survival we could do 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.530
 constructions with a little materials 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.149
 harder to find or 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.950
 get in a pretty way 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.720
 simple simply by having wood or 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.390
 pebble any of the two boxes 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.640
 so more basic we could serve good 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.350
 Let's see how this works how click 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.880
 food is made that really I 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.399
 I think it's going to be easy and you're going to see 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.869
 ok we're going to the creative mode and now 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.399
 yes we have here all the materials that 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.080
 we are going to need for this invention that 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.509
 as you can see here it is already complete but 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.130
 we are going to make another invention more 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.360
 so you can see how the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 true that the construction is quite 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.039
 simple that yes before I start I'm going 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.899
 to say a very important detail of 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.970
 this clip and it's what food always 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.040
 it has to be facing north or 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.500
 to the south if you look to the east or 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.630
 west will not work and this because gona 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.160
 Well I do not know I have no idea but 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.900
 example if we made the invention in that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.610
 address would not work since it 's 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.829
 looking east so very important 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.680
 guys that always food is watching 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.269
 north or south to start we're going 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680
 to need then we simply take 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.049
 blocks of any material in this 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 case caught clay by varying a bit and 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.280
 let's make a line of blocks of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.689
 seven long it's worth so we started 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 here 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.650
 there we would have it seven long and at 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.599
 end of that line of blocks we're going to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.430
 put a block on top and two more blocks 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.170
 on the sides of that last block 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.090
 that we have put from those two 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.829
 blocks we're going to make seven lines of 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.359
 long as you are going to see around here one in 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.329
 that side and another in the other very 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.560
 important and on the left side what 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.810
 which would be the left side of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.579
 invention we are going to put normal pistons 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.069
 until the end looking towards the area 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.500
 center of the invention but removing say 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.209
 or making the corner now yes in the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.310
 rest of laterals let's give one more 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.470
 of height as you see here in all 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.359
 the sides and we're going to go to the part of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.159
 behind the normal pistons below 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.220
 the normal pistons we are going to put a 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.349
 line of blocks in that line of blocks 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.700
 let's put stone torches on top 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.310
 red so that all the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.019
 normal pistons and in that same block 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.590
 that we have put we are going to put buttons 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.480
 What are the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.269
 to change the materials as you have 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.069
 seen on the other side now let's 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.450
 keep doing things this part of 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.489
 down where I put the materials 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.989
 that you can convert that is something that 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.849
 it's a bit more decorative and does not have 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.739
 nothing to do with functionality like this 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.510
 that we will continue to give more height to 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.069
 all this line of the wall that was left 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.170
 over there and on top of the pistons 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.299
 normal, there would also be only one 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.190
 detail for this top part and it's 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.349
 put this block that you see here since 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.849
 in this area we have to release water and 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.590
 otherwise the water would escape us so 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.750
 very important is the block and the water of 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.340
 the upper zone is going to have to be in 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.290
 calm so that it works well in accordance 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.819
 now of what the invention would be by the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.349
 Top part would already be finished 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 now let's give a couple of details for 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.760
 here are the following forward and let 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.769
 to put an adhesive piston here and here 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 that is to say left and right and in what 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.120
 would be the center area let's put a 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.620
 adhesive piston looking up 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 now in these adhesive pistons we're going 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.850
 to put equal blocks of material that 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.130
 we want as we have done before and 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.750
 just in front of where those are 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.850
 normal pistons let's put a 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.860
 red stone torch in front of the of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.960
 the left what would be two blocks of 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.370
 distance from the structure and in this 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.880
 part of the right we're going to put three 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.920
 of stone 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.200
 as you can see until that adhesive piston that 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.670
 I was looking towards the upper area 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.440
 between the torch and the red stone we're going 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.330
 to put a block in which over 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.070
 let's also put red stone and what 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.450
 that would be the invention that allows us 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.580
 make this glitch to change the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.930
 materials would already be finished does not 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.490
 we need to do nothing else and as we have seen 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.440
 the operation is very simple 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.800
 we simply put two slabs of 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.030
 any material in that position where 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.650
 is the adhesive piston facing towards 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.050
 above we will put the stone torch 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.730
 red on the slabs and we will choose the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.130
 material to which we want to transform 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.230
 that block or those slabs that we have put 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.330
 we just come here we pick up the 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.680
 material and we would be able to use it 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.390
 as I tell you with any kind of 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.620
 although I always recommend slabs of 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.870
 wood that are the easiest to 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.460
 get that part below the area 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.080
 of the buttons you can decorate as 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.060
 you see here I have put the materials in 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.200
 which transforms but well that's not 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.150
 is needed for what is the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.730
 working and how do I tell that to 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.560
 I would like it if I put it but well 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.600
 I leave for you the truth that a 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.610
 invention quite interesting as you see 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.080
 around here we can pick up the area where 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.120
 the red stone torches are left 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.130
 so there's no problem and I think that 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.240
 for survival is a pretty clips 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.590
 useful above all 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.449
 get those materials that are a 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.650
 little more difficult and I also remember you 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.630
 that the invention always has to be 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.580
 looking towards the north or south of 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.169
 your map and this would be all for this 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.729
 video guys I hope I called you 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.440
 the attention this glitch that you be of 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.639
 utility that has been seen easy what 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.440
 it would be the tutorial of the invention 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.180
 simply and if you liked to leave a 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.800
 like because it helps a lot and it takes 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.720
 a quick one to give you to subscribe to 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.610
 channel if you are new if you like the 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.190
 content and nothing I hope that soon we 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.550
 let's see in new videos a salutary and 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.900
 see you later, if you want, can you 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.900
 do a great favor 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.210
 a like and a favorites for me is what 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.870
 best 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:29.039
 you will not regret this is your channel 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:34.770
 and this is with life and keystone light 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.770
 with life god your desire in line
