today the music is provided by Ferrari
and<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.750> hills<00:02:36.989> are<00:02:37.170> alive<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.960 

I<00:02:55.769> suspected<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> sports<00:02:57.250> exhaust<00:02:57.489> would

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
I suspected the sports exhaust would

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.729 
I suspected the sports exhaust would
become<00:02:58.330> rather<00:02:58.569> wearing<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.409> stiffer

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
become rather wearing the stiffer

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.530 
become rather wearing the stiffer
suspension<00:02:59.860> would<00:03:00.489> be<00:03:00.640> jarring<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.269> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
suspension would be jarring and the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.390 
suspension would be jarring and the
pebble<00:03:01.840> shift<00:03:02.019> gearbox<00:03:02.290> would<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.769> our<00:03:03.159> kids

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
pebble shift gearbox would be our kids

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.910 
pebble shift gearbox would be our kids
all<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.640> others<00:03:03.909> but<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:04.690> wrong

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.640 

the<00:03:09.849> ride<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:10.390> expected<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.410> harsh

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the ride as expected is on the harsh

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.380 
the ride as expected is on the harsh
side<00:03:11.920> but<00:03:12.160> only<00:03:12.490> when<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.700> going<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.150> worst

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
side but only when you going the worst

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.449 
side but only when you going the worst
surfaces<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.500> rest<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> time<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
surfaces the rest of the time of the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.100 
surfaces the rest of the time of the
suspension<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.300> balance<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> car

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
suspension and the balance of the car

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.440

worked<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.739> well<00:03:17.950> together<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.180> well<00:03:19.360> in

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
worked really well together so well in
