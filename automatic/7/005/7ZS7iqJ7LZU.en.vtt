March<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.430> type<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> time<00:00:54.059> frame<00:00:55.670> it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
March that type of time frame it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.160 
March that type of time frame it's
rumored<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.449> design<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
rumored to have the same design so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
rumored to have the same design so
aluminum<00:00:58.559> unibody<00:00:58.710> Jeff<00:00:59.460> accepts<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.969> be

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
aluminum unibody Jeff accepts gonna be

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
aluminum unibody Jeff accepts gonna be
like<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> lighter<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> stronger<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.710> it'll<00:01:01.859> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
like a lighter and stronger so it'll be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
like a lighter and stronger so it'll be
harder<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> break<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.940> it'll<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.300> like

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
harder to break but it'll be like

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
harder to break but it'll be like
significantly<00:01:04.080> lighter<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.739> pick<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
significantly lighter so you can pick it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
significantly lighter so you can pick it
up<00:01:05.100> easier<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.549> stuff<00:01:08.090> screen<00:01:09.090> wise<00:01:09.270> we'll

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
up easier and stuff screen wise we'll

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
up easier and stuff screen wise we'll
probably<00:01:10.680> looking<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> bigger<00:01:11.610> screen<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
probably looking at a bigger screen so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
probably looking at a bigger screen so
five<00:01:12.479> inches<00:01:12.900> instead<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> current<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
five inches instead of the current it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
five inches instead of the current it's
a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.060> bigger<00:01:15.350> possibly<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.439> upgrade

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
a little bit bigger possibly on upgrade

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.789 
a little bit bigger possibly on upgrade
to<00:01:16.890> 2k<00:01:17.220> resolution<00:01:17.340> which<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.799> approximately

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to 2k resolution which is approximately

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
to 2k resolution which is approximately
1080p<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.450> guess<00:01:21.590> still

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
1080p a little bit better I guess still

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
1080p a little bit better I guess still
really<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.220> current<00:01:23.520> displays<00:01:24.000> just

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really good the current displays just

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
really good the current displays just
absolutely<00:01:24.689> amazing<00:01:24.810> looks<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
absolutely amazing looks like a you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
absolutely amazing looks like a you
can't<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.220> any<00:01:26.369> pixilation<00:01:26.939> anyway<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
can't see any pixilation anyway so I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270 
can't see any pixilation anyway so I
mean<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.530> certain<00:01:28.590> point<00:01:29.040> where

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
mean you get to a certain point where

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
mean you get to a certain point where
you<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.850> need<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> better<00:01:30.390> display

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you don't really need a better display

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.280 
you don't really need a better display
is<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.350> already<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.130> um

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
is just already really good um

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.090 
is just already really good um
apparently<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.770> new<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
apparently there's going to be new and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
apparently there's going to be new and
improved<00:01:35.460> speakers<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.140> think

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
improved speakers on I don't think

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.390 
improved speakers on I don't think
they've<00:01:37.380> integrated<00:01:37.590> Beats<00:01:37.920> Audio<00:01:38.100> again

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
they've integrated Beats Audio again

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.560 
they've integrated Beats Audio again
they<00:01:38.520> might<00:01:38.640> move<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> different<00:01:39.210> type

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they might move on to a different type

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
they might move on to a different type
of<00:01:39.600> company<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.470> son<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
of company what son like that but the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370 
of company what son like that but the
speakers<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.479> definitely<00:01:42.810> improve<00:01:42.899> that's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
speakers would definitely improve that's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170

make<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> phone<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.490> fast<00:01:59.700> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
make the phone really really fast it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
make the phone really really fast it's
already<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.570> extremely<00:02:01.140> fast<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.799> all

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
already like extremely fast with all

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
already like extremely fast with all
that<00:02:02.130> combined<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> double<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that combined will be like double the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
that combined will be like double the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
speed a storage wide shoes
t<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.909> 32<00:02:06.359> gigabytes<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.810> storage<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.350> know

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
t or 32 gigabytes of storage I know

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.609 
t or 32 gigabytes of storage I know
previously<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.190> had<00:02:08.239> 32<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.390> 64<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.500> I'm

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
previously they had 32 and 64 but I'm

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
previously they had 32 and 64 but I'm
thinking<00:02:10.950> they're<00:02:11.039> gonna<00:02:11.160> drop<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.519> down<00:02:11.580> 16

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
thinking they're gonna drop it down 16

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.780 
thinking they're gonna drop it down 16
and<00:02:12.330> allow<00:02:12.569> microSD<00:02:13.260> expansion<00:02:13.590> since<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.489> also

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and allow microSD expansion since I also

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.520 
and allow microSD expansion since I also
think<00:02:14.940> everyone<00:02:15.720> really<00:02:15.900> wanted<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.290> last

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
think everyone really wanted that last

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350 
think everyone really wanted that last
year<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.550> course<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:17.940> most<00:02:18.239> likely

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
year and of course it's most likely

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
year and of course it's most likely
going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> be<00:02:18.900> improvements<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.739> cameras

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
going to be improvements to the cameras

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.190 
going to be improvements to the cameras
as<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.550> guys<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.599> was<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.780> first<00:02:21.959> one

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
as you guys know it it was the first one

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020 
as you guys know it it was the first one
that<00:02:22.230> introduced<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> ultra<00:02:23.160> pixel<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:23.910> is

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that introduced the ultra pixel which is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.180 
that introduced the ultra pixel which is
essentially<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.750> 4<00:02:25.140> megapixel<00:02:25.260> sensor<00:02:26.010> but

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
essentially a 4 megapixel sensor but

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.130 
essentially a 4 megapixel sensor but
like<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.670> had<00:02:26.849> better<00:02:27.090> light<00:02:27.450> reception<00:02:27.750> stuff

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
like I had better light reception stuff

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.039 
like I had better light reception stuff
like<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.720> improved

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
like that but it's going to be improved

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.020 
like that but it's going to be improved
to<00:02:31.170> possibly<00:02:31.709> 10<00:02:32.010> megapixel<00:02:32.610> ultra<00:02:32.879> pixel

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to possibly 10 megapixel ultra pixel

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.630 
to possibly 10 megapixel ultra pixel
rear<00:02:33.390> camera<00:02:33.870> will<00:02:34.530> along<00:02:34.799> with<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.190> possible

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
rear camera will along with the possible

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.030 
rear camera will along with the possible
4k<00:02:36.120> recording<00:02:36.269> capabilities<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.829> front

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
4k recording capabilities and the front

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.559 
4k recording capabilities and the front
still<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> say<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> same<00:02:38.940> at<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.390> 2

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
still going to say the same at like 2

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.120 
still going to say the same at like 2
megapixels<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.519> oil<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.579> was<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:41.880> 720p<00:02:42.360> video

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.530 
megapixels with oil it was at 720p video
front-facing<00:02:44.130> video<00:02:44.400> i<00:02:44.489> believe<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
front-facing video i believe and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
front-facing video i believe and
software<00:02:46.230> wise<00:02:46.349> she<00:02:46.560> expect<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.950> newest

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
software wise she expect the newest

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.250 
software wise she expect the newest
version<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.610> android<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.239> Android<00:02:48.630> 4.4<00:02:49.110> KitKat

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
version of android so Android 4.4 KitKat

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.430 
version of android so Android 4.4 KitKat
and<00:02:49.819> i<00:02:50.819> believe<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.150> 12<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.420> 4.2<00:02:52.079> right<00:02:52.319> now

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and i believe is 12 and 4.2 right now

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.319 
and i believe is 12 and 4.2 right now
but<00:02:52.769> I'm<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.099> sure<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.910> also<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> be

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
but I'm not sure it's also going to be

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.839 
but I'm not sure it's also going to be
