00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello friends in this video i 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.610
 show you how to make paper 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.230
 a very very beautiful flower for this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.469
 we need five square 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.280
 I have 10 sheets of paper 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.280
 I hope centimeter 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.130
 ruts and so we fold diagonally 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 do it like this 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 and now dub on this line here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.210
 now open 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.240
 and flatten out 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.140
 on this side we do the same 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.280
 and close 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.960
 all fifth of our flower is compressed 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 you just have to glue it together 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:49.720
 you need to like this happened to me this 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:52.230
 take my dry glue well 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.230
 we smear 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.819
 and glue 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.769
 in order not to hold and so she 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.610
 stick together you can wear a clothespin 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:28.069
 lightly and wait until she approaches 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.269
 and we do four more things so you 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.450
 have done five pieces now we will do 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.190
 the flower itself 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:45.890
 after the glue is dry we remove 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:49.120
 clothespin and make it a little 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.120
 more circle 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:03.610
 so let's begin to glue this we take everything 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.610
 also glue and smear 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.269
 here these edges 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 and glue 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.719
 you can give a little each time 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.719
 dry out to make it easier 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.719
 glue 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:21.740
 because on live is not very easy 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 glued together 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.140
 all guests only now can it 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.640

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:21.750
 that a little dried up and all the color you can
