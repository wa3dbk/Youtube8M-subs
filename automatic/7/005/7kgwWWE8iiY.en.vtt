00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.310 
let's find out how the Kladno model
builders<00:02:20.550> design<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.330> assemble<00:02:22.080> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
builders design and assemble this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.380 
builders design and assemble this
gigantic<00:02:22.890> Lego<00:02:23.340> dragon<00:02:25.550> first<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.970> basic

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
gigantic Lego dragon first the basic

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.600 
gigantic Lego dragon first the basic
shape<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.780> pushed<00:02:28.140> pulled<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.920> tweaked<00:02:29.400> on

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
shape is pushed pulled and tweaked on

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.750 
shape is pushed pulled and tweaked on
the<00:02:29.700> computer<00:02:30.150> until<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.630> looks<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.290> right

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the computer until it looks just right

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
the computer until it looks just right
then<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.910> designers<00:02:33.360> use<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> program<00:02:34.050> called

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
then the designers use a program called

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.770 
then the designers use a program called
Lego<00:02:34.770> brick<00:02:35.100> builder<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:36.000> convert<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> 3d

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
Lego brick builder to convert the 3d

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.960 
Lego brick builder to convert the 3d
computer<00:02:37.320> model<00:02:37.650> into<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> pattern<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:38.820> can

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
computer model into a pattern they can

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.020 
computer model into a pattern they can
build<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.570> Lego<00:02:39.810> bricks<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.880> was

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
build with Lego bricks so it was

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.690 
build with Lego bricks so it was
designed<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.540> spinal<00:02:45.990> chop<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.220> next<00:02:47.490> step

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
designed a spinal chop and the next step

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.570 
designed a spinal chop and the next step
is<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.600> technicians<00:02:49.110> job<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.430> model

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
is the technicians job to make the model

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.810 
is the technicians job to make the model
stiff<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.209> strong<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:53.340> will<00:02:53.520> go<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
stiff and strong and so we will go and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.160 
stiff and strong and so we will go and
see<00:02:54.060> how<00:02:54.660> they<00:02:54.840> do

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.720 

giant<00:02:58.170> models<00:02:58.530> made<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:58.920> Lego<00:02:59.130> bricks<00:02:59.490> are

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
giant models made with Lego bricks are

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.870 
giant models made with Lego bricks are
heavy<00:03:00.200> really<00:03:01.200> heavy<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.830> order<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.520> make<00:03:02.700> this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880
