00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
correctly you should not need to go over

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.609 
correctly you should not need to go over
at<00:00:27.060> station<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:27.869> once<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.439> just

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
at station more than once we're just

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.400 
at station more than once we're just
gonna<00:00:28.769> mist<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.119> light<00:00:30.359> hairspray<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
gonna mist it with a light hairspray the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.350 
gonna mist it with a light hairspray the
key<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.160> doing<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.460> once<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.030> doing<00:00:33.149> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
key to doing this once I'm doing it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
key to doing this once I'm doing it
right<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.079> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.530> comb<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.460> sure

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
right is to take a comb make sure

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
right is to take a comb make sure
there's<00:00:35.969> no<00:00:36.270> knots<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> hair<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.050> all

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
there's no knots in the hair at all

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
there's no knots in the hair at all
because<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.860> over<00:00:38.129> knots<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.520> heat

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
because going over knots with heat

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.450 
because going over knots with heat
obviously<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.930> cause<00:00:40.079> breakage<00:00:40.410> lay<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
obviously just cause breakage lay the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
obviously just cause breakage lay the
hair<00:00:41.640> inside<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.750> straightness<00:00:43.200> take<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> comb

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
hair inside the straightness take a comb

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.180 
hair inside the straightness take a comb
and<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:45.180> slide<00:00:45.510> following<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> comb<00:00:46.680> all

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and just slide following the comb all

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
and just slide following the comb all
the<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.969> end<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.140> not

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the way to the end you can see I'm not

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
the way to the end you can see I'm not
going<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.680> quickly<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.969> I'm<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.239> not

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
going really quickly but I'm also not

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.490 
going really quickly but I'm also not
dawdling<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
dawdling and then you can see that is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
dawdling and then you can see that is
yeah<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.760> babiness<00:00:57.149> time'

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
yeah just the babiness time'

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
yeah just the babiness time'
straighteners<00:00:57.870> given<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.260> incredible<00:00:58.739> finish

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
straighteners given an incredible finish

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
straighteners given an incredible finish
one<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.239> diamond<00:01:00.719> infused

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
one because they have diamond infused

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
one because they have diamond infused
plaits<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.530> means<00:01:01.890> they're<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.370> smooth

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
plaits which means they're really smooth

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
plaits which means they're really smooth
and<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.510> give<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:04.080> better<00:01:04.110> heat

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and so they give a much better heat

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890 
and so they give a much better heat
distribution<00:01:05.270> secondly<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.689> give

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
distribution secondly because they give

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.480 
distribution secondly because they give
off<00:01:06.990> negative<00:01:07.020> ions<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.040> gets<00:01:08.280> rid<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
off negative ions which gets rid of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
off negative ions which gets rid of
frizz<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> again<00:01:09.390> helps<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> shine

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
frizz and again helps with the shine

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
frizz and again helps with the shine
when<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.159> begin<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> straightening<00:01:12.659> always

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
when you begin the straightening always

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.830 
when you begin the straightening always
make<00:01:13.470> sure<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.850> close<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
make sure that you don't close the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
make sure that you don't close the
straightener<00:01:16.259> until<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> start<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> move

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
straightener until you start to move

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.670 
straightener until you start to move
because<00:01:18.119> again<00:01:18.420> some<00:01:18.689> people<00:01:18.720> cause<00:01:19.140> lines<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
because again some people cause lines in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
because again some people cause lines in
their<00:01:19.860> hair<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> would<00:01:20.970> always<00:01:21.240> tend<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
their hair I would always tend to take a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
their hair I would always tend to take a
section<00:01:22.080> around<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.250> same<00:01:23.460> width<00:01:23.790> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
section around about the same width as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
section around about the same width as
the<00:01:24.119> straightener<00:01:24.830> obviously<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> have

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the straightener obviously if you have

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
the straightener obviously if you have
really<00:01:26.460> curly<00:01:26.820> hair<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.689> take<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
really curly hair then you can take a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
really curly hair then you can take a
smaller<00:01:28.259> section<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.700> need<00:01:29.939> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
smaller section and if you don't need so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
smaller section and if you don't need so
much<00:01:30.299> straightening<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> take<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> wider

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
much straightening you can take a wider

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
much straightening you can take a wider
section<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> negative<00:01:33.509> ions

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
section so you can see the negative ions

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
section so you can see the negative ions
are<00:01:33.990> actually<00:01:34.470> helping<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.280> rid<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> frizz

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
are actually helping to get rid of frizz

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.660 
are actually helping to get rid of frizz
it's<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.509> weightless<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.049> well<00:01:37.310> your<00:01:38.310> every
