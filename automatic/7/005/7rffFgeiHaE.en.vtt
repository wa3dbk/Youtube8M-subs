so today I'm going to kind of put the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.180 
so today I'm going to kind of put the
spotlight<00:00:02.700> on<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> recently<00:00:03.959> finished<00:00:04.319> katana

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
spotlight on a recently finished katana

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.419 
spotlight on a recently finished katana
that<00:00:05.490> I've<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:06.509> I've<00:00:06.660> made<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.230> used<00:00:08.189> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that I've that I've made and used that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.040 
that I've that I've made and used that
as<00:00:08.490> sort<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.910> an<00:00:09.030> opportunity<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.809> talk<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
as sort of an opportunity to talk a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.870 
as sort of an opportunity to talk a
little<00:00:10.320> bit<00:00:10.500> about<00:00:10.679> how<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> commissioning

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
little bit about how the commissioning

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.760 
little bit about how the commissioning
process<00:00:12.120> works<00:00:17.930> now<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.170> talk<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.560> ten

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
process works now if you talk to ten

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.320 
process works now if you talk to ten
different<00:00:20.100> blade<00:00:20.340> makers<00:00:20.820> they're<00:00:21.029> all<00:00:21.180> going

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
different blade makers they're all going

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
different blade makers they're all going
to<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.570> different<00:00:21.960> opinions<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.500> whether

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
to have different opinions about whether

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
to have different opinions about whether
they<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.910> Commission's<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.410> how

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
they like to do Commission's and how

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.859 
they like to do Commission's and how
they<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.609> them<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.150> custom<00:00:27.660> work

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
they like to do them that is custom work

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.370 
they like to do them that is custom work
so<00:00:28.859> custom<00:00:29.670> blades<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.330> basically<00:00:31.109> different

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
so custom blades are basically different

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.950 
so custom blades are basically different
from<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:32.070> handmade<00:00:32.759> blades<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> sense

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
from just handmade blades in the sense

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.860 
from just handmade blades in the sense
that<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.530> customer<00:00:35.340> comes<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> Smith<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that a customer comes to the Smith and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
that a customer comes to the Smith and
says<00:00:37.050> hey<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.190> want<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.760> specific<00:00:39.239> sort

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
says hey you know I want a specific sort

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
says hey you know I want a specific sort
of<00:00:40.140> blade<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of blade and this is how it's going to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
of blade and this is how it's going to
be<00:00:45.289> spectators<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
be spectators of what they want and in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
be spectators of what they want and in
other<00:00:49.350> cases<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.370> may<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.660> more

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
other cases it may be a little bit more

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
other cases it may be a little bit more
impressionistic<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.430> let's<00:00:53.640> talk<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> little

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
impressionistic so let's talk a little

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.630 
impressionistic so let's talk a little
bit<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.780> particular<00:00:55.440> blade<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
bit about this particular blade here the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
bit about this particular blade here the
heart<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> project<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> blade<00:00:58.350> itself

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
heart of the project is the blade itself

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
heart of the project is the blade itself
which<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> twenty<00:00:59.879> eight<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> half<00:01:00.210> inches

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
which is twenty eight and a half inches

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.410 
which is twenty eight and a half inches
in<00:01:00.840> blade<00:01:01.230> length<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.399> ACOG<00:01:02.760> au<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.120> tang

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
in blade length with an ACOG au or tang

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050 
in blade length with an ACOG au or tang
of<00:01:03.690> around<00:01:04.019> nine<00:01:04.409> inches<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> whole<00:01:05.760> blade

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of around nine inches so the whole blade

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
of around nine inches so the whole blade
weighs<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.810> around<00:01:06.930> thirty<00:01:07.409> seven<00:01:07.799> inches

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
weighs in at around thirty seven inches

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.570 
weighs in at around thirty seven inches
like<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.299> my<00:01:09.510> blades<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.830> clay<00:01:11.100> hardened

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
like all my blades it's a clay hardened

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
like all my blades it's a clay hardened
blade<00:01:11.700> meaning<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.450> differentially

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
blade meaning it's differentially

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
blade meaning it's differentially
hardened<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> manner<00:01:14.250> used<00:01:14.580> on

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hardened in the manner used on

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
hardened in the manner used on
traditionally<00:01:15.420> made<00:01:15.630> Japanese<00:01:16.200> blades<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

perfectly happy to do that but I also
enjoy<00:01:50.520> mounting<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.810> case

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
enjoy mounting them so in this case

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.840 
enjoy mounting them so in this case
basically<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> did<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> whole<00:01:53.820> thing

soup-to-nuts the fuji kashira set and
Manucci<00:01:57.659> were<00:01:58.259> custom<00:01:58.890> made<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.670> copper<00:01:59.969> by

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
Manucci were custom made from copper by

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.469 
Manucci were custom made from copper by
me<00:02:00.630> i<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.590> carved<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> tsuba<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:03.030> mild

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
lot of disadvantages to using it so I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.690 
lot of disadvantages to using it so I
really<00:02:22.270> like<00:02:22.510> using<00:02:22.780> nitro<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.650> laid<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.310> about

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
really like using nitro I laid on about

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.170 
really like using nitro I laid on about
4<00:02:25.120> layers<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.750> custom<00:02:26.170> mixed<00:02:26.560> red<00:02:26.830> lacquer

4 layers of a custom mixed red lacquer

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
4 layers of a custom mixed red lacquer
then<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> couple<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.720> layers<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.140> clear<00:02:29.530> coat

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
then a couple of layers of clear coat

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.490 
then a couple of layers of clear coat
then<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.490> applied<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> pattern<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.600> 23-karat

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
then I applied a pattern of 23-karat

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.310 
then I applied a pattern of 23-karat
gold<00:02:32.530> leaf<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> added<00:02:34.570> another<00:02:34.690> four<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
gold leaf then I added another four to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.610 
gold leaf then I added another four to
six<00:02:35.560> layers<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.980> clear<00:02:36.370> coat<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:38.110> really

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
six layers of clear coat this was really

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.430 
six layers of clear coat this was really
a<00:02:38.650> gratifying<00:02:39.340> project<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.150> me<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:41.050> client

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
a gratifying project to me the client

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.890 
a gratifying project to me the client
specified<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> length<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.819> geometry<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
specified the length the geometry the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
specified the length the geometry the
steel<00:02:44.170> type<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.830> colors<00:02:45.220> then<00:02:45.850> pretty

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
steel type and the colors then pretty

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.320 
steel type and the colors then pretty
much<00:02:46.390> left<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> details<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.500> me<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:49.090> know<00:02:49.209> in

much left the details to me you know in
the<00:02:49.420> past<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.930> used<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.410> take<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.770> projects<00:02:51.370> for

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the past I used to take on projects for

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.509 
the past I used to take on projects for
clients<00:02:51.700> specified<00:02:52.570> really<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.620> every<00:02:54.280> last

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
clients specified really just every last

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.960 
clients specified really just every last
detail<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.540> down<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.050> millimeter<00:02:56.410> and

detail right down to the millimeter and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.310 
detail right down to the millimeter and
frankly<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.000> turn<00:02:58.330> those<00:02:58.540> kind<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.810> projects

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
frankly I turn those kind of projects

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.860 
frankly I turn those kind of projects
down<00:02:59.620> now<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.280> mean<00:03:00.730> obviously<00:03:00.880> every<00:03:01.420> clients

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
down now I mean obviously every clients

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.690 
down now I mean obviously every clients
got<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.170> right<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:02.650> what<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.010> want<00:03:03.310> but

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
got the right to get what they want but

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.120 
got the right to get what they want but
here's<00:03:04.330> what<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> found<00:03:04.630> I've<00:03:05.200> found<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
here's what I found I've found that a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.860 
here's what I found I've found that a
lot<00:03:06.550> of<00:03:06.700> times<00:03:06.910> things<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:07.420> look<00:03:07.630> good<00:03:07.810> on

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
lot of times things that look good on

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.800 
lot of times things that look good on
paper<00:03:08.260> ended<00:03:08.860> up<00:03:08.980> either<00:03:09.220> being<00:03:09.550> just<00:03:10.330> really

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
paper ended up either being just really

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.410 
paper ended up either being just really
difficult<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.500> execute<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.310> kind<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.239> in

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
difficult to execute or kind of in

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.979 
difficult to execute or kind of in
elegant<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.110> their<00:03:14.320> final<00:03:14.739> results<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.700> I

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
elegant in their final results so I

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.720 
elegant in their final results so I
really<00:03:16.989> believe<00:03:17.140> now<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:18.160> best<00:03:18.459> results

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
really believe now that the best results

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.759 
really believe now that the best results
are<00:03:19.180> achieved<00:03:19.269> when<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.840> customer<00:03:20.290> gives<00:03:20.500> me

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
are achieved when the customer gives me

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.190 
are achieved when the customer gives me
general<00:03:21.640> guidance<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.360> know<00:03:22.510> lengths<00:03:22.870> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
general guidance you know lengths and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.410 
general guidance you know lengths and
things<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.650> nature<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.820> terms<00:03:25.090> of

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
things of that nature but in terms of

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.470 
things of that nature but in terms of
curvature<00:03:26.140> blade<00:03:26.799> thickness<00:03:27.250> balance<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
curvature blade thickness balance and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.830 
curvature blade thickness balance and
and<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.019> things<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.530> nature<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:30.840> really

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and and things of that nature I really

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.360 
and and things of that nature I really
think<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:32.110> best<00:03:32.350> if<00:03:32.500> they<00:03:32.709> sort<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.010> leave<00:03:33.190> it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
think it's best if they sort of leave it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.069 
think it's best if they sort of leave it
to<00:03:33.459> me<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.610> work<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> details<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> way

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
to me to work out the details in the way

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.080 
to me to work out the details in the way
that<00:03:35.260> seems<00:03:35.500> most<00:03:35.769> harmonious<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.910> lot

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
that seems most harmonious because a lot

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.460 
that seems most harmonious because a lot
of<00:03:37.120> times<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.540> get<00:03:37.660> into<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.989> middle<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
of times you get into the middle of the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.770 
of times you get into the middle of the
project<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> find<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.690> know

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
project and you find that you know

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.330 
project and you find that you know
something<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.500> seemed<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.100> would

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
something that just seemed like it would

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.150 
something that just seemed like it would
work<00:03:42.519> well<00:03:42.880> doesn't<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> context<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.920> all

the other little bits and pieces that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.750 
the other little bits and pieces that
you're<00:03:47.620> putting<00:03:47.829> together<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.400> make<00:03:48.579> this

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you're putting together to make this

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.410 
you're putting together to make this
blade<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.709> over<00:03:51.100> time<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.370> kind<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.880> evolved

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
blade so over time I kind of evolved

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.500 
blade so over time I kind of evolved
away<00:03:52.540> from<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.410> more<00:03:53.680> detailed
