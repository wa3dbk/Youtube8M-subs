camera there is it has actual

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.580 
camera there is it has actual
temperature<00:03:22.340> sensor<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.360> on<00:03:23.660> right<00:03:24.560> over

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
temperature sensor in this on right over

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.320 
temperature sensor in this on right over
here<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.519> actually<00:03:25.670> senses<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
here so it actually senses the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
kind of adjusts itself off the net so it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.390 
kind of adjusts itself off the net so it
kind<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.160> keeps<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.579> xbox<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.920> lot<00:03:33.920> cooler<00:03:34.190> if
