 creative movement system 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.790
 but if we have something creative Director Dieter changed so to say 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010
 that needs 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.250

 I heard the court 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.220
 the ways to design therapy are just crazy 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.340
 I can not say anything specific, so just one example a good ten years ago 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 So I worked on the skins for PlayStation and Xbox so the first one 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.290
 The goal is to push here and I would say that we are always the same 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.260
 Ways to character design Brink have this time in this game 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.710
 and that's really a lot of ending for an ego-shooter too 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 Bracht 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 really big addresses on the many skills so i would not like that

 because he needs but we have a lot of 8 to leave with her 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.800
 Euros are also more than you would expect in a shooter 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.150
 a big part of the game is about building your character and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.969
 Experience points Hoffenheim 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.119
 and you could also buy new equipment 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.769
 APA was 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.849
 which brewed from the baptism is the puddle the system is very clever it is about 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.980
 that she pushes the button and said to the game you want then you have to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.560
 of course bigger only to chaos undefeated

 It is undoubtedly the App Store can also be offered 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.409
 the push but for having a really successful one we can now 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.020
 To lead are that of the former port of Pusan 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.190

 To hit the team and bring it to the ground / et or an orchestra 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.949
 No. a 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.389
 For example, on one side of this book reads like this 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.239
 slip down liquefied 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.939
 then you do not have to open that next door and I from the local ones 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.349
 let shoot 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.199
 cutter 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.069
 an important aspect of smart it still 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.899
 that's the game does not play 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.209
 there are only tactical options 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.359
 take care of the red line and the 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.319
 leap 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.069
 Coins should press and Chancellor pull and shoot concentrated because 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.559
 That's it Gomez finally goes for in this game 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.559
 Fun shooting

 that does not even seem so bad 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.409
 and brings is not bad we were allowed to do so by hand 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.419
 Although they were known as city containers, they were complex 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.479
 posted but otherwise very positive 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.830
 the developers have fantastic ideas and the talent they need 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.139
 to transform functioning game 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.279
