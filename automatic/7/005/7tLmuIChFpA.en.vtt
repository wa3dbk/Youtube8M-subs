player to remove the mind control so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.300 
player to remove the mind control so
this<00:01:50.970> could<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.119> easily<00:01:51.509> done<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:52.310> stacking

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
this could be easily done by stacking

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
this could be easily done by stacking
together<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.869> pretty<00:01:55.140> easy<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.500> by

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
together and it's pretty easy just by

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
together and it's pretty easy just by
doing<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.159> li<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> pretty<00:01:57.780> bad

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
doing a li so we got a pretty bad

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
doing a li so we got a pretty bad

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
little crazy to deal with but it really

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.100 
little crazy to deal with but it really
depends<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.430> how<00:02:27.610> many<00:02:27.790> bosses<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.330> killed<00:02:28.630> on

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
how bad it's gonna be so since this is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.970 
how bad it's gonna be so since this is
our<00:02:31.120> second<00:02:31.570> boss<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.470> was<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.800> pretty

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
our second boss it was actually pretty

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.949

hard<00:02:33.310> because<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.610> had<00:02:33.730> maddening<00:02:34.300> shout

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
hard because we had maddening shout

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
throughout the whole entire fight it's

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.860 
throughout the whole entire fight it's
probably<00:02:36.760> best<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.330> guy<00:02:37.510> last

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
probably best if you get this guy last

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.020 
probably best if you get this guy last

within eight yards of each other so if

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.410 
within eight yards of each other so if
you<00:04:02.890> spread<00:04:03.160> out<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.549> you'll<00:04:03.760> avoid<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> ton<00:04:04.390> of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
you spread out it you'll avoid a ton of

you spread out it you'll avoid a ton of
the<00:04:04.540> damage<00:04:04.900> otherwise<00:04:05.650> that's<00:04:05.859> pretty<00:04:06.040> much

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
the damage otherwise that's pretty much

the damage otherwise that's pretty much
it<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.519> fight<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.510> depends

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
it to the fight it just really depends

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.599 
it to the fight it just really depends
on<00:04:08.079> which<00:04:08.260> bosses<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.829> get<00:04:08.980> first<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.489> which

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
on which bosses you get first and which

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.610 
on which bosses you get first and which
boss<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.120> last<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:11.019> we<00:04:11.200> got<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.440> worst

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
boss you get last so we got the worst

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.640 
boss you get last so we got the worst
case<00:04:11.769> scenario

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
case scenario

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.229 
case scenario
but<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.129> bosses<00:04:13.579> are<00:04:13.790> what<00:04:13.970> he<00:04:14.060> thought

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
but the bosses are what he thought

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.900 
but the bosses are what he thought
coming<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.560> harder<00:04:15.860> ones<00:04:16.040> coming<00:04:16.370> first<00:04:16.609> and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
coming the harder ones coming first and

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.759 
coming the harder ones coming first and
then<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.060> easier<00:04:17.329> ones<00:04:17.479> coming<00:04:17.750> last<00:04:17.989> then<00:04:18.590> I

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
then the easier ones coming last then I

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.039 
then the easier ones coming last then I
also<00:04:18.919> DC<00:04:19.489> twice<00:04:19.790> twice<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.419> his<00:04:20.449> fight<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.959> as

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
also DC twice twice on his fight and as

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.659 
also DC twice twice on his fight and as
you<00:04:21.139> can<00:04:21.259> see<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.590> lost<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.949> ton<00:04:21.979> of<00:04:22.160> players<00:04:22.460> due

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
you can see we lost a ton of players due

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.200 
you can see we lost a ton of players due
to<00:04:22.850> random<00:04:23.750> DC's<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.500> server<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.009> stability

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
to random DC's and server and stability

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.430 
to random DC's and server and stability
otherwise<00:04:26.210> mostly<00:04:26.539> an<00:04:26.660> easy<00:04:26.810> fight<00:04:27.139> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
otherwise mostly an easy fight and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.110 
otherwise mostly an easy fight and
here's<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.889> great<00:04:28.070> example<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.550> me<00:04:28.759> and<00:04:29.000> not

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
here's a great example of me and not

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.400 
here's a great example of me and not
warm<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.539> that's<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.780> warm<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.169> actually

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
warm so that's the warm you actually

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.230 
warm so that's the warm you actually
gotta<00:04:30.530> run<00:04:31.070> away<00:04:31.340> from<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.820> just<00:04:32.030> make<00:04:32.210> sure

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
gotta run away from and just make sure

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.939 
gotta run away from and just make sure
you're<00:04:32.570> away<00:04:32.720> from<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.930> raid<00:04:33.169> when<00:04:33.770> you're

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
you're away from the raid when you're
