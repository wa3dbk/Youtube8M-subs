00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 welcome to the classes 12 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.930
 Today I want to be the smallest intel 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.600
 core i5 processor the inter live at 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:20.730
 4,460 with the amd fx 8350 and aphex 9590 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 processors compare both of these 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 internet 4064 and the amd fx-8150 cost 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.070
 about the same 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 That's why I make this comparison 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.009
 I think that's a pretty 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 Interesting horses comparison between 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.150
 Above all, Teens is pure in these numbers 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.390
 so we will come to the same 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.390
 benchmarks 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.140
 So first of all I want to know you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.740
 Let all three processes be right 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 are great 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.330
 the Intel 4460 falls in comparison to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.880
 amd fx-8150 rendering and video and 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.290
 coding off if you have videos with 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.530
 eg adobe premiere per country is the 1 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 4460 much better than the effect 8350 me 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.910
 was a little disappointed a ds 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.280
 Processors so far due the smallest 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.410
 to see the 4460 he performs 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 Significantly more apps and games when we play 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.220
 we have to look at the electricity consumer 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.899
 you realize that that is effective 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.899
 Of course, consume much more electricity 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.179
 as the eifel 4460 we count 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.370
 quickly everything on the alb is better 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.980
 when video rendering the access places 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.140
 at 3d rendering for example and video 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.940
 in codings of the aif brings more 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.459
 performance in games and last but not least 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.850
 consume the effects bus more power 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.670
 one last thing, however, is f 1 4460 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.250
 and the effect 8000 53 cost approximately 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.030
 both the same 35 has a locked one 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.220
 multiplier the flex 8350 has one 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 completely freely selectable and thus one can 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.519
 very easy to overclock and so more 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.769
 performance for the same price 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.630
 squeeze out in the end it is yours 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.070
 decision not mine decides 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.810
 which of them is the winner 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.850
 I hope I could join you somehow 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.480
 Thank you for the choice 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.430
