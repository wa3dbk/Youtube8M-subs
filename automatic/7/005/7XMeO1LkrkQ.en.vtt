 Good day dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.859
 channel my name is andrew and today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.440
 let's see a pixel toy under 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.469
 title think engine dungeon 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.019
 doomed this printer pg old school 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.880
 in the car pack you know where it is very yes 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.300
 earlier such games made this field 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.119
 gloomy with they went field pixel by 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.359
 essentially everything is very simple we have one hero and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.869
 we don't manage maybe sit down either 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.279
 the sword or the magic and pour in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.470
 we display the upper left corner 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.559
 our life to someone icons team which 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.309
 lurking use one point man his 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 here and so go out all kill swing 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.539
 we are gaining experience and experience let's say 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 statistics for the next 6 parameters are 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.140
 the strength of which here is our damage 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.719
 which we wear 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.059
 protection ie absorbed ron agility 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 to avoid damage during the making clear 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.260
 have stamina 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.010
 the will for magicians and my fishing rods such 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.740
 such a parameter 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.140
 purely so that it is now permissible 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.630
 with each increase in each level 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.869
 killing mobs of course we get 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 level for each one point 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.729
 which we can spend there well 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.740
 Let's say from hair that will increase 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.470
 damage our saving the game also works 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.630
 have inventory inventory we have three kinds 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.270
 potions 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 let's say health potions gives you life 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.150
 land amanda march 20 gives ya eats 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 your 10 antidote which treat their here 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 I gave the day like antifreeze which 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 freezing evening can only later 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 magical such here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.689
 about the quality of sauron that or other enemies 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.659
 rub the flying shoes so you can 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.240
 was for some reason go on 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.670
 stairs, I have not yet met some 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
 ladders okay yes you can even skeleton 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.079
 transform nifigase to plus 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.079
 some jokes that give 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.060
 a shield that reflects about this, that's all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.470
 it's all inventory and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 few things and even than not I found 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 honestly against us quickly 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.090
 and the item quickly access and with comes to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.830
 it's empty 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.489
 it could be dangerous to remember mana 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.160
 there wanted that and the house and the upper right 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.329
 corner we have a compass go 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.690
 what will be here nowhere Odessa honestly 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:39.510
 Here we have such a principle 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.890
 we can step back praise so basically 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 yes throws 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.340
 that is , we do not particularly hit in this 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.739
 style the game is all very simple in 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.379
 Basically there I will say yes at the beginning of the game you 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.560
 can choose time and specialty i 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:00.780
 chose let battle Lego farthing 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.329
 and what is this firefly code me to you 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.959
 my water magic we beat in the country 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.299
 come down 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.350
 but see here I can not move 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.570
 cosmetic in shoes 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.840
 to read what just need texture 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:19.750
 so there are 6 in my opinion 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.780
 or 5 and 6 classes and 4 times his 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.550
 since it is a mark man elf cart 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.430
 depending only choose tamara 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.840
 different sciences are given to you 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.530
 are distributed more precisely the leadership is waiting 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.920
 I immediately also magic 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:45.680
 you need to bullet volume and you can fluff it was 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.070
 strong skeleton and reach the next 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.250
 level let's pump over finished 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.750
 dreams of mayhem nobody give more strength 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.840
 pumping well peel me mano 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.230
 you can not something not drink plug 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.230
 brute 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.739
 organic boots gold 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:16.459
 cool so you can understand it here still 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:22.100
 different magic if orosko freezes 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.530
 slaughter then lightning so I understand the type 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.860
 single circle or what 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:33.130
 what is the last you do not know honestly 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.389
 let's see and see in general 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.849
 depending on your class you also 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.830
 get captive and 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.139
 on any bonuses something that would 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.199
 removing playing overboard slide except 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.090
 that nickname attack goes even more things 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.960
 set will not try here such eyes 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.039
 unusual general then such a game to someone 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.560
 here I think it will be interesting to someone 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.410
 because all the same people who 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.190
 a little bit younger than i say yes 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.289
 they have not met such here 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.389
 dismantling the game to be honest for them 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.420
 it may not even be new 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.160
 and interesting changes therefore 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.680
 on the principle I advise here such here before 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.230
 there were games and there were a lot of them 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.210
 were more to find with logical 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.750
 critical this style trimmer 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.520
