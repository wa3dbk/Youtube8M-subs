00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:19.260
 and there is not a pleasure always to be invited 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 in these panels with women and do that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.860
 the day of the lovers and surely 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.750
 the women of rbs want to see more 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.970
 attractive for his man why 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.520
 We brought the proposal how to do it in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.670
 the house is how to do it 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.670
 extensions 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.969
 we have a model that can go through 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.969
 favor of ecology well as time 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.949
 on television ladies and gentlemen is very 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.949
 very very fast very short 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.019
 so we have gone ahead 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 as I always do there I have advanced 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:03.379
 little in this dear girl but we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.379
 we are late 00 extension 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 look there are many ways today thanks to 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.930
 this free market we have a lot of access 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.700
 many hair products to hair to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.090
 have a very expensive very complicated thing 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.910
 very difficult to find today 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.280
 we found from the stores already 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.050
 established in the market a large 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.270
 number of extensions that come in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.740
 curtains if there are prices put your 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.509
 how many curtains do we need three 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.509
 minimum we need 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 this curtain usually comes in a 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.020
 strip that has approximately one meter 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.789
 and half and you are cutting the according to the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 need you cut them your taste 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.270
 This comes in a small package a bag 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 closed that weighs 100 gr and this is hair 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.080
 natural or synthetic these are hairs 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.720
 naturals who have a job of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.399
 quality that goes from you want to get 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.410
 if they wanted a fast party you can 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.850
 find 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.190
 quickly in this project and you go to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.930
 game give name to the Chinese to the gentlemen 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.990
 that a good good place where you can 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.160
 find qualities from the basic 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.160
 up to the best qualities 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.520
 even well armed how is the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.200
 I'm going to show you one of the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.730
 fundamental things there is this little thing that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.120
 it's called micro clamps that I have here 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 are the elements that hold the hair 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.950
 and even micro tracks 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.150
 they can not use principles and currents 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.130
 they have to do this micro piece because 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 these allow that when I put the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.620
 hair I'm not going to fall the night 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.700
 the trick of this thing well generally 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.020
 when you arm the extensions and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.970
 there they are going to have to make a 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.950
 fundamental change because when the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.530
 they sell them with these micro 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.959
 they think put down 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
 and he says how long I've been in 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.890
 this circus I realized that if I the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 I put it upside down with the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.490
 patitas the resistance is much more 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.800
 big and we do not need to do big 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.160
 things to live then your technique my 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.050
 wanted to place the situation 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.010
 do not roll do not fall 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.020
 exactly the first thing we're going to do 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.819
 is to make a separation as you see yanina 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.160
 here we are not only going to do it a little bit 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.500
 more neat is super important to be 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.880
 as neat as possible schalke in that 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.880
 line where they hold 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.470
 we will help you let's do this which is 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.950
 a little more clarita for you 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.950
 note the difference 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.930
 something to do as nuditos 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.030
 we have two possibilities when the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.819
 micro thinks is up is not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.340
 necessary when it's down if you already 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.219
 is armed what we are going to do is 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.139
 measure where we are going to put this then 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.139
 when measuring we look for this side 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.000
 finished smoothie carded like you 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.000
 want 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.860
 works 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:43.449
 we avoid then that it is rolled and 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.009
 run with this extension and you can 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.340
 place as one side the ear up 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.840
 the other side of the ear 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.729
 and so is it like a stepped 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.740
 to the hair, not exactly you can be 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.449
 for everything you can choose several ranges of 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.129
 colors even to make it look 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.249
 more natural 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.849
 and the fundamental idea to then for 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:05.729
 that looks good is just trying to 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.199
 put more hair one of reverter works 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.539
 but if we have to do and affective 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.969
 we need to put more hairs then that 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.339
 then let's take a wavy and 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.209
 let's unite a little what we would have 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.209
 with what there was 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.929
 smooth wavy of what we do of it 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.989
 way we take it and that makes it not 

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:30.649
 note the union between the extension and the 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:30.649
 ready now 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.479
 in that we already had prepared half 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:44.839
 for you to see that the thing was not 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.839
 we need
