at<00:00:08.730> some<00:00:09.950> bags

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.420 

to<00:00:14.850> bag<00:00:15.270> assets<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.530> little<00:00:16.830> armor<00:00:17.160> plate

to bag assets and a little armor plate

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.370 
to bag assets and a little armor plate
and<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.330> these<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> character<00:00:19.170> over<00:00:19.440> here

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.080 

as<00:00:24.380> well<00:00:24.620> as<00:00:24.800> some<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.400> newer<00:00:25.670> clothes

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
as well as some of the newer clothes

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.780 
as well as some of the newer clothes
this<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.110> also<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:27.530> new<00:00:27.800> rabbit<00:00:28.070> model<00:00:28.370> you

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
this is also the new rabbit model you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.390 
this is also the new rabbit model you
can<00:00:28.940> tell<00:00:29.150> because<00:00:29.390> he<00:00:29.690> has<00:00:29.840> four<00:00:30.320> toes<00:00:30.620> I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.030 

think<00:00:34.400> that<00:00:34.480> these<00:00:35.480> bags<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.350> equipment

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
think that these bags and equipment

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.150 
think that these bags and equipment
should<00:00:37.160> look<00:00:37.340> really<00:00:37.640> cool<00:00:37.850> in<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.360> game

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
should look really cool in the game

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.070 
should look really cool in the game
during<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.370> fight<00:00:40.610> they<00:00:40.910> might<00:00:41.120> Bob<00:00:41.420> around<00:00:41.750> or

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
during a fight they might Bob around or

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.760 
during a fight they might Bob around or
break<00:00:42.260> off<00:00:44.739> as<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:47.180> can<00:00:47.360> see<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.110> rabbits<00:00:48.559> are

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
break off as you can see the rabbits are

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.520 
break off as you can see the rabbits are
really<00:00:49.280> into<00:00:49.610> adding<00:00:50.090> stitching<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:51.200> all

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
really into adding stitching to all

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.020 
really into adding stitching to all
their<00:00:51.800> equipment<00:00:52.010> that's<00:00:52.430> one<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.730> their<00:00:52.879> main

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
their equipment that's one of their main

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.650 
their equipment that's one of their main
visual<00:00:53.510> motifs<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:55.030> think<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.210> they<00:00:56.450> just

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
visual motifs I think that they just

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.120 
visual motifs I think that they just
like<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.170> way<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.440> looks<00:00:59.650> last<00:01:00.650> week<00:01:00.950> I

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
like the way that looks last week I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.630 
like the way that looks last week I
showed<00:01:01.160> off<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.730> cat<00:01:01.910> city<00:01:02.239> assets<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:04.160> lot

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
showed off the cat city assets and a lot

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280 
showed off the cat city assets and a lot
of<00:01:04.729> people<00:01:04.880> commented<00:01:05.509> that<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:05.720> looked<00:01:05.990> kind

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
of people commented that it looked kind

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.950 
of people commented that it looked kind
of<00:01:06.380> like<00:01:06.470> Assassin's<00:01:07.220> Creed<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.729> i<00:01:08.690> think

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
of like Assassin's Creed and i think

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.680 
of like Assassin's Creed and i think
that<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.040> current<00:01:10.340> assets<00:01:10.820> do<00:01:11.030> kind<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.450> look

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
that the current assets do kind of look

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.660 
that the current assets do kind of look
like<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:12.830> i<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.280> some<00:01:13.490> other<00:01:13.580> ideas

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
like that but i have some other ideas

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.570 
like that but i have some other ideas
and<00:01:14.420> i<00:01:15.200> wanted<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.530> talk<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.740> little<00:01:16.130> bit<00:01:16.369> about

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
and i wanted to talk a little bit about

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.320 
and i wanted to talk a little bit about
them<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:19.250> cats<00:01:19.490> tend<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.880> wear<00:01:20.030> very

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
them the cats tend to wear very

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.430 
them the cats tend to wear very
flamboyant<00:01:20.830> colors<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.130> patterns<00:01:23.440> because

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
flamboyant colors and patterns because

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.100 
flamboyant colors and patterns because
the<00:01:25.399> colors<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.880> patterns<00:01:26.000> represent<00:01:26.420> their

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
the colors and patterns represent their

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.280 
the colors and patterns represent their
holdings<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.740> retainers<00:01:28.930> similarly<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
holdings and retainers similarly the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.370 
holdings and retainers similarly the
pennants<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.659> colors<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:32.810> they<00:01:32.960> paint<00:01:33.200> on

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
pennants and colors that they paint on

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.850 
pennants and colors that they paint on
buildings<00:01:34.990> correspond<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.530> colors<00:01:36.830> that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
buildings correspond to the colors that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.670 
buildings correspond to the colors that
an<00:01:37.340> individual<00:01:37.940> cat<00:01:38.180> might<00:01:38.450> wear<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.500> it's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
an individual cat might wear so it's

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.790 
an individual cat might wear so it's
kind<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.040> marking<00:01:40.640> his<00:01:40.729> territory

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.980 

in<00:01:46.340> addition<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.850> showing<00:01:47.090> those<00:01:47.330> ideas<00:01:47.690> off

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
in addition to showing those ideas off

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.650 
in addition to showing those ideas off
better<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.860> actual<00:01:49.220> game<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.850> wanted<00:01:50.570> to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
better in the actual game I wanted to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.320 
better in the actual game I wanted to
create<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.260> more<00:01:51.890> unique<00:01:52.220> visual<00:01:52.520> identity<00:01:53.060> for

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
create a more unique visual identity for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.460 
create a more unique visual identity for
the<00:01:53.420> kids<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:55.810> started<00:01:56.810> looking<00:01:56.870> at<00:01:57.230> more

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
the kids so I started looking at more

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.640 
the kids so I started looking at more
historical<00:01:59.050> images<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.280> ruins<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.650> I

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
historical images and ruins and I

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.610 
historical images and ruins and I
listened<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.190> some<00:02:04.610> comments<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.620> started

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
listened to some comments and started

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.670 
listened to some comments and started
coming<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:06.980> with<00:02:07.040> this<00:02:07.250> concept<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:08.680> based

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
coming up with this concept here based

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.610 
coming up with this concept here based
kind<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:10.430> Babylonians<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:12.080> a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
kind of on the Babylonians but also a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.000 
kind of on the Babylonians but also a
little<00:02:13.160> bit<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.580> Asian<00:02:14.060> cultures<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.830> main

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
little bit on Asian cultures the main

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.950 
little bit on Asian cultures the main
thing<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.670> important<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> me<00:02:20.180> was<00:02:20.330> to

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
thing that was important to me was to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.350 
thing that was important to me was to
bring<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:23.170> consistent<00:02:24.370> color<00:02:25.370> theme<00:02:25.760> together

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
bring a consistent color theme together

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
bring a consistent color theme together
for<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> cats<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.710> their<00:02:27.860> buildings

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
for the cats in their buildings

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.340 
for the cats in their buildings
especially<00:02:29.000> these<00:02:29.570> ones<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:30.020> live<00:02:30.170> out<00:02:30.320> in

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
especially these ones that live out in

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.390 
especially these ones that live out in
the<00:02:30.470> desert

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.039 

one<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.609> important<00:02:34.999> parts<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.359> this<00:02:35.540> are

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
one of the important parts of this are

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.220 
one of the important parts of this are
these<00:02:36.290> blue<00:02:36.590> tile<00:02:36.829> roofs<00:02:37.840> had<00:02:38.840> been<00:02:39.079> meaning

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
these blue tile roofs had been meaning

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.390 
these blue tile roofs had been meaning
to<00:02:39.560> replace<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.340> roofs<00:02:40.549> for<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> while<00:02:41.389> and<00:02:42.400> so
