now the eBay
just<00:01:25.149> really<00:01:25.359> make<00:01:25.479> sure<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.929> you<00:01:51.360> under<00:01:52.360> the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
just really make sure that you under the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.749 
just really make sure that you under the
hairline<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.500> stays<00:01:53.739> in<00:01:53.979> place<00:01:54.250> if

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
hairline so that it stays in place if

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.869 
hairline so that it stays in place if
the<00:01:54.939> even<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.599> slips<00:01:55.989> down<00:01:56.379> probably<00:01:57.369> because

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:57.879 
the even is slips down probably because

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.999 
the even is slips down probably because
the<00:01:58.060> materials<00:01:58.599> knew<00:01:58.959> that<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.439> could<00:01:59.649> be<00:01:59.770> an

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
the materials knew that that could be an

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.479 
the materials knew that that could be an
issue<00:02:00.310> just<00:02:00.700> dandy
