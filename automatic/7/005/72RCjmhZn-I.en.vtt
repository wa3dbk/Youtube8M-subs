pro but first let me tell you a little
bit<00:00:18.150> about<00:00:18.359> juicing<00:00:18.750> because<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.289> easy

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
bit about juicing because it's so easy

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
bit about juicing because it's so easy
we've<00:00:20.850> incorporated<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.750> large<00:00:22.199> feed<00:00:22.560> chute

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
we've incorporated a large feed chute

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
we've incorporated a large feed chute
that<00:00:22.830> means<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.400> don't<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> pre<00:00:24.090> chop

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
that means you don't have to pre chop

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.450 
that means you don't have to pre chop
your<00:00:24.570> fruit<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.900> veg<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.680> you'll<00:00:25.800> fit<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
your fruit and veg when you'll fit the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.070 
your fruit and veg when you'll fit the
largest<00:00:26.820> apple<00:00:27.060> down<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> chute<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.779> don't

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
largest apple down the chute you don't

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.240 
largest apple down the chute you don't
have<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> peel<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.859> even<00:00:28.949> take<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
have to peel it you don't even take the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.679 
have to peel it you don't even take the
stickers<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.060> throw<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> down<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
stickers off you just throw it down and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
stickers off you just throw it down and
you<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> juice<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you get the juice out one in and the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
you get the juice out one in and the
waste<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> other<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.510> most

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
waste out the other and the most

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
waste out the other and the most
important<00:00:34.260> part<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.559> juicers<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.520> our

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
important part of our juicers is our

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
important part of our juicers is our
filter<00:00:36.270> disk<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.050> essentially<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> fruit<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
filter disk so essentially the fruit and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.069 
filter disk so essentially the fruit and
veg<00:00:38.190> hits<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> chopping<00:00:39.510> blade<00:00:39.690> gets

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
veg hits the chopping blade gets

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.440 
veg hits the chopping blade gets
pulverized<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.980> milliseconds<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.180> juice

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
pulverized in milliseconds and the juice

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.560 
pulverized in milliseconds and the juice
comes<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.989> through<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.410> super<00:00:43.680> fine<00:00:44.129> filter

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
comes out through this super fine filter

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.610 
comes out through this super fine filter
coming<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.960> jug<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> that's<00:00:46.469> what

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
coming out into your jug and that's what

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
coming out into your jug and that's what
you<00:00:46.739> drink<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.160> anything<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> can't<00:00:48.059> fit

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you drink and anything that can't fit

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
you drink and anything that can't fit
through<00:00:48.539> these<00:00:48.750> tiny<00:00:49.050> microscopic<00:00:49.500> holes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
through these tiny microscopic holes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.279 
through these tiny microscopic holes
ends<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> waste<00:00:51.239> bin<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> three

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
ends up in the waste bin so the three

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
ends up in the waste bin so the three
juicers<00:00:52.710> working<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> same<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.329> what

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
juicers working the same way but what

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
juicers working the same way but what
you<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> move<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> range<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you get as you move up the range is a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
you get as you move up the range is a

variable speed and your reason you want

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
variable speed and your reason you want
a<00:01:04.170> variable<00:01:04.379> speed<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.100> higher<00:01:05.280> speeds

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
a variable speed you want higher speeds

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
a variable speed you want higher speeds
for<00:01:05.820> those<00:01:05.939> hard<00:01:06.210> fruits<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> slower<00:01:07.380> speeds

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for those hard fruits and slower speeds

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.929 
for those hard fruits and slower speeds
for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> soft<00:01:08.310> fruits<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:08.820> getting

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
for the soft fruits so we're getting

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
for the soft fruits so we're getting
more<00:01:09.060> juice<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> jug<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> top<00:01:11.520> two

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
more juice in the jug and on the top two

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
more juice in the jug and on the top two
models<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.270> include<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.810> fridgey<00:01:13.260> disc<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
models we include a fridgey disc and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.109 
models we include a fridgey disc and
what<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.159> does<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> gives<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
what this does is it gives you the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
what this does is it gives you the
ability<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.509> add<00:01:15.720> bananas<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> berries<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
ability to add bananas and berries and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
ability to add bananas and berries and
other<00:01:17.250> hard<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> juice<00:01:18.030> fruits<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.840> your

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
other hard to juice fruits into your

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
other hard to juice fruits into your
juicing<00:01:19.590> regime<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.610> essentially<00:01:21.119> we've

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
juicing regime so essentially we've

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
juicing regime so essentially we've
taken<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> filter<00:01:22.080> disc<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> outside<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
taken the filter disc off the outside so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.130 
taken the filter disc off the outside so
with<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> disc<00:01:24.180> everything<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.780> goes<00:01:24.930> down

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
with this disc everything that goes down

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
with this disc everything that goes down
the<00:01:25.290> chute<00:01:25.530> ends<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> jug<00:01:26.759> gives<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the chute ends up in the jug gives the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
the chute ends up in the jug gives the
ability<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.619> call<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> Fuji<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
ability to make what we call the Fuji so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
ability to make what we call the Fuji so
it's<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> addition<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.299> pureed<00:01:31.020> bananas<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it's the addition of pureed bananas and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's the addition of pureed bananas and
juice<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> normal<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.659> combine<00:01:34.049> those

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
juice in a normal way you combine those

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
juice in a normal way you combine those
together<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> fresh<00:01:35.159> fruit<00:01:35.549> juice

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
together and you get a fresh fruit juice
