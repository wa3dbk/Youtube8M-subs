a new stick in my hand you better feel
like<00:00:41.050> right<00:00:41.289> away<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.800> widow<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> big

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
like right away the widow is a big

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.729 
like right away the widow is a big
difference<00:00:43.090> from<00:00:43.329> my<00:00:43.539> from<00:00:43.780> my<00:00:43.810> old<00:00:44.050> stickin<00:00:44.560> I

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
difference from my from my old stickin I

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.620 
difference from my from my old stickin I
didn't<00:00:45.040> have<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.340> change<00:00:45.610> my<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.880> way<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.210> shot

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
didn't have to change my the way I shot

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.660 
didn't have to change my the way I shot
or<00:00:46.810> anything<00:00:47.200> but<00:00:47.380> just<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:48.040> shot<00:00:48.280> got<00:00:48.460> away<00:00:48.640> a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
or anything but just the shot got away a

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.770 
or anything but just the shot got away a
lot<00:00:48.880> easier<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.579> shot<00:00:51.820> harder<00:00:52.180> I<00:00:52.390> think

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
lot easier and and I shot harder I think

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.440 
lot easier and and I shot harder I think
this<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> kick<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:55.120> don't<00:00:55.329> have

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
this like the kick in it you don't have

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.840 
this like the kick in it you don't have
to<00:00:55.630> do<00:00:56.380> that<00:00:56.440> much<00:00:56.770> too<00:00:57.010> if<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.250> get<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.489> get<00:00:57.790> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
to do that much too if you get to get a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.060 
to do that much too if you get to get a
shot<00:00:58.090> away<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.600> now<00:00:59.020> I<00:00:59.050> issue<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.950> little

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
shot away and now I issue a little

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.979 
shot away and now I issue a little
harder<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.850> most<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.540> time<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> got<00:01:01.840> home

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
harder and most of the time I got home

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.429 
harder and most of the time I got home
store<00:01:02.230> in<00:01:02.320> front<00:01:02.559> too<00:01:02.770> so<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.040> helps<00:01:03.550> me<00:01:03.670> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
store in front too so it helps me to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.469 
store in front too so it helps me to
well<00:01:05.439> I<00:01:05.469> think<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.950> lets<00:01:06.219> the<00:01:06.369> tape<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:07.090> on

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
well I think that lets the tape on on on

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.120 
well I think that lets the tape on on on
the<00:01:07.780> blade<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.170> problem<00:01:08.560> because<00:01:08.799> i'm<00:01:08.920> lazy

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
the blade is problem because i'm lazy

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.550 
the blade is problem because i'm lazy
when<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.729> do<00:01:09.850> my<00:01:10.180> steak<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.689> it<00:01:11.140> goes<00:01:11.350> really

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
when I do my steak it it goes really

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.980 
when I do my steak it it goes really
fast<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.399> but<00:01:12.939> I<00:01:12.969> think<00:01:13.240> also<00:01:13.420> we're<00:01:13.659> going<00:01:13.810> to

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
fast and but I think also we're going to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.169 
fast and but I think also we're going to
the<00:01:14.350> Sun<00:01:14.560> finish<00:01:14.979> on<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.189> kind<00:01:15.549> of<00:01:15.610> helps<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.030> to

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
the Sun finish on it kind of helps it to

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.020 
the Sun finish on it kind of helps it to
then<00:01:16.420> when<00:01:16.539> you<00:01:16.659> receive<00:01:17.369> pass<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.670> stuff<00:01:18.880> it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
then when you receive pass and stuff it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.449 
then when you receive pass and stuff it
doesn't<00:01:19.119> bounce<00:01:19.420> as<00:01:19.689> much<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.799> feel<00:01:21.069> of<00:01:21.100> the

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
doesn't bounce as much the feel of the

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.429 
doesn't bounce as much the feel of the
passing<00:01:21.909> it's<00:01:22.270> more<00:01:22.539> important<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.020> me<00:01:23.229> but

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
passing it's more important to me but

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.800 
passing it's more important to me but
they<00:01:24.069> can<00:01:24.280> make<00:01:24.459> a<00:01:24.490> stick<00:01:24.850> with<00:01:25.090> great<00:01:25.479> feel

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
they can make a stick with great feel

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.629 
they can make a stick with great feel
and<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.409> can<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:26.740> advantage<00:01:27.189> with<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.399> good

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639 
and I can have advantage with a good

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.910 
and I can have advantage with a good
kick<00:01:27.909> it's<00:01:28.179> it's<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.929> optimal<00:01:29.409> thing<00:01:29.560> for<00:01:29.799> me

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
kick it's it's the optimal thing for me

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.249 
kick it's it's the optimal thing for me
when<00:01:30.189> it's<00:01:30.340> kind<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:30.999> close<00:01:31.179> corns<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:31.840> i<00:01:32.079> have
