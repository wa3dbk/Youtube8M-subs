quite<00:00:15.630> quickly<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.619> afraid<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
quite quickly and I'm afraid there is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I've had to delete the audio tracks

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.740 
I've had to delete the audio tracks
because<00:00:23.670> there<00:00:23.939> were<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> few<00:00:24.359> people<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
because there were a few people in the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.330

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.400 
but I'm actually not going to have any
place<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.980> those<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.790> saw<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
place to make those of you saw the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.670 
place to make those of you saw the
momentous<00:00:41.899> that<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.140> played<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
momentous that I actually played at the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
momentous that I actually played at the
event<00:00:43.950> you'll<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:45.270> build<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
event you'll see that my my build is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040 
event you'll see that my my build is
quite<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> guess<00:00:46.559> reactive<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.690> plays<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> lot<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
quite I guess reactive it plays a lot of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
quite I guess reactive it plays a lot of
the<00:00:49.110> Atlantean<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> requires<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.280> opponent

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the Atlantean so it requires my opponent

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
the Atlantean so it requires my opponent
to<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> cards<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.719> pop<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.110> me

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to have a lot of cards I can pop for me

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
to have a lot of cards I can pop for me
to<00:00:52.260> try<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:53.250> advantage<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.510> going

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to try and get my my advantage so going

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
to try and get my my advantage so going
first<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.739> only<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.370> good<00:00:56.579> dependent

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
first for me is only so good dependent

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
first for me is only so good dependent
on<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.239> hand<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.690> always<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.289> first

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
on my hand I always want to go first

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.900 
on my hand I always want to go first
because<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> means<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.489> step

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
because it means i can actually step

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
because it means i can actually step
depending<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.230> self<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.710> spheres

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
depending what I have self my spheres

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
depending what I have self my spheres
and<00:01:02.190> whatnot<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> problem

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and whatnot but it is a bit of a problem

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
and whatnot but it is a bit of a problem
so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.670> look<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.270> my<00:01:06.330> hand<00:01:06.510> which

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so I do have to look at my hand which

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.030 
so I do have to look at my hand which
contains<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.290> Atlanteans<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
contains a lot of Atlanteans in this

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830

because it's a new chain the vanities

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.060 
because it's a new chain the vanities
has<00:01:58.920> resolved<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.890> quite<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
has resolved so here I think for quite a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.620 
has resolved so here I think for quite a
while<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.880> i'm<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> megalo

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
while about how i'm going to megalo

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
again i do have the capacity to mega low

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
again i do have the capacity to mega low
again<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.429> whether<00:02:08.640> or<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:08.879> i

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
again but it's it's whether or not i

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.270 
again but it's it's whether or not i
want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.360> minus<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.140> play<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.679> then

version as I said every extra term I
give<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.220> opponent<00:02:59.640> gives<00:03:00.180> him<00:03:00.300> another<00:03:00.360> turn

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
give the opponent gives him another turn

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.170 
give the opponent gives him another turn
that<00:03:00.810> he<00:03:00.900> could<00:03:01.080> set<00:03:01.350> up<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:02.030> virgin<00:03:03.030> beast

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that he could set up a virgin beast

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
that he could set up a virgin beast
warrior<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.959> take<00:03:04.110> control<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
warrior and just take control of the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.490 
warrior and just take control of the
game<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> swing<00:03:06.030> twice<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:06.540> mega<00:03:06.720> low<00:03:06.870> 48

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
game so I swing twice with mega low 48

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.400 
game so I swing twice with mega low 48
and<00:03:08.160> passed<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.640> my<00:03:08.819> opponent<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.150> he's<00:03:09.269> on

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and passed on to my opponent so he's on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.170 
and passed on to my opponent so he's on
3,200<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.530> set<00:03:11.040> what<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> believe<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> sphere

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
3,200 I set what I believe is the sphere

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.710 
3,200 I set what I believe is the sphere
and<00:03:12.420> pass<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.880> everyone<00:03:15.180> was<00:03:15.239> drawn<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.630> his

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and pass so everyone was drawn for his

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.509 
and pass so everyone was drawn for his
turn<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.590> still<00:03:16.860> need<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> think<00:03:17.250> about<00:03:17.370> his

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
turn he still need to think about his

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
turn he still need to think about his
place<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.880> obvious<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.269> he<00:03:18.480> still<00:03:18.750> does

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
place it's obvious that he still does

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.860 
place it's obvious that he still does
not<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.680> tanky<00:03:20.040> Yamato<00:03:20.459> or<00:03:20.790> duality<00:03:21.269> so

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
not have the tanky Yamato or duality so

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.850 
not have the tanky Yamato or duality so
he's<00:03:21.989> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> summon<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.530> bushing

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
he's going to summon the bushing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.900 
he's going to summon the bushing
equivalent<00:03:23.280> there's<00:03:23.430> nothing<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.790> really

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
equivalent there's nothing I can really

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.940 
equivalent there's nothing I can really
do<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.630> at<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.320> point<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.650> pretty

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
do about this at this point is pretty

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.319 
do about this at this point is pretty
clear<00:03:26.280> he's<00:03:26.430> got<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.640> crane<00:03:26.850> there's<00:03:27.120> no

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
clear he's got the crane there's no

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.630 
clear he's got the crane there's no
reason<00:03:27.840> not<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.049> crane<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.890> honest<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:29.519> is

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
reason not the crane the honest there is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.580 
reason not the crane the honest there is
no<00:03:29.820> reason<00:03:30.030> he<00:03:30.329> would<00:03:30.540> normal<00:03:31.140> someone<00:03:31.380> if<00:03:31.500> he

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
no reason he would normal someone if he

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.949 
no reason he would normal someone if he
didn't<00:03:31.860> have<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> honest<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.180> he's<00:03:33.600> goodness

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
didn't have the honest so he's goodness

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.229

going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> attack<00:03:34.860> me<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.670> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
going to attack me and then going to the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.900 
going to attack me and then going to the
damage<00:03:36.510> step<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.780> drop<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> honest<00:03:37.910> dealing

damage step and drop the honest dealing
me<00:03:39.500> 1600<00:03:40.500> points<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.739> damage<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.870> believe<00:03:42.870> I

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
me 1600 points of damage I believe I

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.229 
me 1600 points of damage I believe I
correct<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> Life<00:03:43.650> Points<00:03:43.859> incorrectly<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
correct the Life Points incorrectly and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.539 
correct the Life Points incorrectly and
then<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.420> acted<00:03:45.840> corrected<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.769> don't

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
then I acted corrected but I don't

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.130 
then I acted corrected but I don't
understand<00:03:47.880> why<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.030> think<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.420> took<00:03:48.870> myself

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
understand why I think I took myself

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.190 
understand why I think I took myself
down<00:03:49.440> by<00:03:49.590> 3k<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:50.940> by<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.420> damage<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.170> would

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
down by 3k so I'm by the damage I would

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.410 
down by 3k so I'm by the damage I would
have<00:03:52.380> taken<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.739> was<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.890> crane<00:03:53.190> not<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:54.299> it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
have taken if that was a crane not if it

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.729 
have taken if that was a crane not if it
wasn't<00:03:54.630> honest<00:03:54.900> because<00:03:55.049> I'd<00:03:55.230> crane<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
wasn't honest because I'd crane on the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.870 
wasn't honest because I'd crane on the
mind<00:03:55.950> even<00:03:56.130> though<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.370> can't<00:03:56.640> crane

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
mind even though you can't crane

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.440 
mind even though you can't crane
equivalent<00:03:57.859> so<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.890> dropped<00:03:59.340> my<00:03:59.489> term<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.940> didn't

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
equivalent so I dropped my term I didn't

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.789 
equivalent so I dropped my term I didn't
use<00:04:00.600> sphere<00:04:00.930> because<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.260> wanted<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:01.560> what

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
use sphere because I wanted to see what

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.740 
use sphere because I wanted to see what
my<00:04:01.950> draw<00:04:02.280> was<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> specifically<00:04:03.239> remember<00:04:03.600> that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
my draw was I specifically remember that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.270 
my draw was I specifically remember that
it's<00:04:04.739> good<00:04:04.920> old<00:04:05.070> James<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.870> was<00:04:07.019> James<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.130> the

it's good old James it was James is the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.590 
it's good old James it was James is the
main<00:04:08.430> reason<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:08.850> guys<00:04:09.030> can't<00:04:09.359> see<00:04:09.540> an

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
main reason you guys can't see an

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.780 
main reason you guys can't see an

this video so i activate my sphere in my
turn<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:17.609> because<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.970> really<00:04:18.150> wanted<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.450> see

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
my draw just in case it gave me kind of

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.610 
my draw just in case it gave me kind of
some<00:04:21.359> other<00:04:21.539> dynamic<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.019> win<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.229> game<00:04:22.260> like

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
some other dynamic to win the game like

if I drew if I drew a Gundam I in my
drawer<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.830> would<00:04:25.919> basically<00:04:26.099> win<00:04:26.310> me<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.580> get

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730
