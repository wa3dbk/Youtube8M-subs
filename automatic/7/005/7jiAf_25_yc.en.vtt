why<00:00:07.440> does<00:00:07.649> my<00:00:07.830> iPhone<00:00:08.250> die<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.790> fast<00:00:09.139> are<00:00:10.139> you

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
why does my iPhone die so fast are you

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890 
why does my iPhone die so fast are you
charging<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:11.040> every<00:00:11.370> night<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:12.509> every<00:00:12.870> night

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
charging it every night not every night

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.460 
charging it every night not every night
but<00:00:13.349> most<00:00:13.980> nights<00:00:14.299> if<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.599> let<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.960> discharged

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
but most nights if you let is discharged

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.980 
but most nights if you let is discharged
all<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.160> too<00:00:17.220> often<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.210> battery<00:00:18.660> might

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
all the way too often the battery might

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.870 
all the way too often the battery might
lose<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.410> ability<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.859> charge<00:00:20.310> completely

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
lose the ability to charge completely

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660 
lose the ability to charge completely
then<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> will<00:00:22.109> die<00:00:22.289> faster<00:00:22.920> after<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> full

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
then it will die faster after a full

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.750 
then it will die faster after a full
charge<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> has<00:00:25.050> less<00:00:25.350> juice<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.670> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
charge because it has less juice it is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.599 
charge because it has less juice it is
an<00:00:27.060> almost<00:00:27.420> new<00:00:27.660> phone<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.130> charger

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
an almost new phone is the charger

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.749 
an almost new phone is the charger

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
plugged in if plugged in it still might

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.930 
plugged in if plugged in it still might
not<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.239> working<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:34.410> works<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
not be working it works because it is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
charging the phone very fast you could

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
charging the phone very fast you could
end<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.250> half<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> charge<00:00:44.879> though<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
end up with half a charge though the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.049 
end up with half a charge though the
phone<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> plugged<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.500> day<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.100> thought

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
phone is plugged in all day I thought

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
phone is plugged in all day I thought
they<00:00:48.300> had<00:00:48.360> better<00:00:48.570> performance<00:00:49.230> than<00:00:49.289> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
they had better performance than that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
they had better performance than that
the<00:00:50.520> USB<00:00:51.090> charger<00:00:51.600> has<00:00:51.780> even<00:00:52.140> worse

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the USB charger has even worse

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
the USB charger has even worse
performance<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> computer<00:00:53.610> goes<00:00:53.850> into

isn't full power to the PC it won't give
more<00:01:00.180> than<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> trickle<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> phone<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.620> don't

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
more than a trickle to the phone I don't

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.210 
more than a trickle to the phone I don't
know<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> problem<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> Hardware<00:01:04.049> related

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
know if the problem is Hardware related

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
know if the problem is Hardware related
if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> leave<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> GPS<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> location-based

if you leave the GPS and location-based
services<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.270> drain<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> battery

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
services on it will drain the battery

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.429 
services on it will drain the battery
really<00:01:10.380> fast<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:13.140> why<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
really fast I know that that's why I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.100 
really fast I know that that's why I
keep<00:01:13.830> those<00:01:14.040> services<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> minimum<00:01:15.240> if

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
keep those services to a minimum if

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.690 
keep those services to a minimum if
someone<00:01:16.530> has<00:01:16.710> hacked<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> phone<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
someone has hacked the phone with that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
someone has hacked the phone with that
program<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.330> captures<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.290> audio<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
program that captures all your audio and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800 
program that captures all your audio and
sends<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> cloud<00:01:20.850> it'll<00:01:21.570> drain<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
sends it to the cloud it'll drain the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.890 
sends it to the cloud it'll drain the
battery<00:01:22.290> pretty<00:01:22.590> fast<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.909> same<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> true<00:01:24.360> if

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
battery pretty fast the same is true if

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
battery pretty fast the same is true if
I<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> apps<00:01:25.860> running<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.430> the
