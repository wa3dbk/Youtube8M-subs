00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello welcome my name is alejandro 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.410
 I am a teacher of the wooden area of the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.870
 technical center of German and today they 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.469
 we bring information about what is 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.469
 location of the wood 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.509
 what is the purpose of this of this that 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.750
 you know the method to calculate 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:28.539
 board feet of one or several pieces 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.329
 of wood so that so when 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.559
 you learn this and apply this 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.260
 method making different 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.760
 types of furniture the content that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.460
 we bring is about what is the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.010
 wood communication 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.100
 the location of the area importance in 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.379
 the work of wood 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 because this by means of this method 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 we were able to calculate the material quantity 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.769
 of material necessary for manufacturing 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.750
 of one or several projects in a workshop 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.630
 furniture construction 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 how the wood is located to locate the 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.500
 hand we have to take into account certain 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 elements for example the foot is talking 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.370
 which is the measure of a piece of wood 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.830
 that has one foot long a foot of 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.320
 wide and one inch thick the long 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.780
 of the piece begins the width of the piece 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.540
 in inches and the thickness of the piece in 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.220
 inches and a divisor that is the number 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.729
 of inches that is one foot long 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.260
 this gives us a formula that is defined 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.090
 as pepe is equal to him that is the long 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.540
 by the width by the thickness on the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.430
 divider 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.380
 when the weapon of the piece is in 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.450
 inches we use as an investor 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 the number that results from multiplying the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.490
 long one foot by itself 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.220
 well here we have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 a picture of what a foot is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.640
 talk we said earlier that the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.549
 drawing the talar foot is a measure of a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.630
 foot of the slab of a foot by a foot by 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.630
 one inch thick 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 well here we can see an image about 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.990
 what is the width and thickness of the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.880
 pieces and there you can see represented 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.700
 the width and you can also see 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 represented the thickness of a skin of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 the pieces of wood 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.580
 how a good piece of wood is located 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.020
 there we have an example to calculate the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.180
 amount of board feet that has a 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.400
 piece of wood that has 10 feet of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.790
 long and 6 inches wide dark 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.240
 of fat we apply the formula later 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.460
 we change the values ​​and doing this 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 mathematical expression at the end of the day 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.550
 mind that that piece of mara has 10 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.130
 board feet we have another 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.960
 another example calculate the amount of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.600
 stones wooden boards that is spent on 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.090
 a board that has 75 inches of 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.110
 long 16 inches wide and one inch 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.420
 thick 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.930
 there we can see that he 'is not here is 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.450
 giving in inches applying the formula to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.069
 we change the values ​​only that this 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.989
 once the divisor is 144 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.490
 which is the number that was given 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.870
 multiply 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.180
 the length of a foot is speaking for itself 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.060
 same and we see that the amount of 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.220
 result is 6.25 feet 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.640
 well here we can have the example 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.440
 one from the simplest furniture but 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 to make this piece of furniture is necessary 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.610
 also know the location of the wood 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.400
 to 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.710
 get the amount of material that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 you need to make it too 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.250
 we have example 2 that one that is a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.710
 Magazine is also necessary to know that 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.300
 locate to know the amount of 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.860
 material you need we have the example 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.950
 3 in banks and in example 4 gives us 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.260
 and a more modern furniture more larger 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.470
 but in order to build it, it is necessary 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.620
 know also locate the hand the material 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.590
 that is needed we also have here the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.980
 example yes it is a modern kitchen and 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.980
 in the end 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.690
 the goal is that we have to build 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.550
 a wooden project using the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.930
 publication method to see the 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.270
 amount of material that is needed 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.510
 to manufacture it and the content 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:27.350
 conceptual is the calculation of what is the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.200
 good wood waiting for all this 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.590
 material will serve them well 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.800
 we thank you and see you up 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.800
 soon
