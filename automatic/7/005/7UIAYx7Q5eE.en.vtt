00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 audience started laying the vowels here 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.100
 will start with animals in breast 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 first and then if that collision 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.340
 place can go on with it 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.690
 explain the vowels to their breasts 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 to places others can 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.099
 excavate stable are thin and krill and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.990
 click on it 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.810
 vowels rise and stable 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 subsurface bass dig the garden ground 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 to a depth of at least 20 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 centimeters to the curbs of it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 to be able to place a garden path 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 then he places the first border stone 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 the curbs ensure that the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 foundation is not pushed away and that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 the vowels don't move for one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.770
 good drainage you must ensure one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 slope 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 for that you hit two posts in the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.879
 ground with a language in between and good 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.579
 decay before drainage is one to two 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.379
 centimeters per meter 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.379
 bas checks this with a spirit level 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.050
 then place the other one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.050
 curbs against the language 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170
 I can press them with the back 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.249
 from a hammer or trowel 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.249
 [Music] 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.950
 war with 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.980
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.030
 for detail what is it important that the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.330
 curbs that touch one another straight 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.330
 corner 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.560
 before you do the opposite row 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.790
 place curbs you first place one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 strip of vowels until you find the desired one 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 width of the path 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 so you know exactly how far the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.740
 curbs must come apart and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.580
 you don't have to be annoying afterwards 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.580
 grinding work 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.700
 the foundation must be approximately 15 centimeters 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.740
 thick and consists of two layers 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 the first layer is a layer of crushed stone that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.700
 divided with a rake 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.630
 ok within a cement vv of the second 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.700
 part of the foundation is one 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.410
 stabilization layer that consists of sand 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.270
 and cement 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 you are here partly cement with 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.010
 seven parts of sand was used here one 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.370
 but you can also do that with the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.370
 hand 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.140
 to make the surface smooth use 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.240
 you a reilat 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.040
 start at the highest point so you can already 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.970
 distribute the sand evenly over it 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.970
 full garden path 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.260
 bass uses pass slats that the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.970
 follow the slope of the garden path 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.650
 he drives through the excess sand 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.730
 write back and forth with the slat 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.730
 over the pass latte 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.750
 bass closes the vowels in two because he 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.450
 our chose for 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.010
 make a half-brick bond 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.069
 of course you can also choose block 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.600
 herringbone or herringbone bandage 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.780
 starts with placing the vowels 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.639
 always on the edge for this pattern 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.699
 exchange one in the first row 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.169
 whole vowel with a half 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.280
 with a hammer you make sure that the 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.280
 vowels are stuck well 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.870
 the next row of vowels can just be 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.870
 to connect 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.289
 the next step is to roll out 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.240
 the garden path 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.090
 bas uses a board and one for this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.800
 beam but you can also use this 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.800
 making an electric vibrator 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.960
 finally fill the joints of one 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.020
 garden path with fine white sand to them 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.620
 fully filled is a brush 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.400
 Hereby a very practical tool 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.470
 necessary for 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.330
 the stairs you still have to take are there 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.070
 an occasional bit of 90 that how all of them 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.479
 inserted is that you let it dry 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.010
 but who wrote what may still 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.580
 add a bit of sand to the hasulam virus 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.690
 they 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.690
 because a beautiful one is all added
