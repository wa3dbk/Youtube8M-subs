theming<00:02:21.930> involved<00:02:22.409> with<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.459> one

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
theming involved with it and I think one

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.220 
theming involved with it and I think one
of<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> things<00:02:24.060> why<00:02:24.299> this<00:02:24.510> coaster<00:02:24.840> isn't<00:02:25.049> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
of the things why this coaster isn't a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
of the things why this coaster isn't a
bit<00:02:25.409> higher<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.129> these<00:02:26.489> wing

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
bit higher is because these wing

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.210 
bit higher is because these wing
coasters<00:02:27.330> aren't<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:27.840> forceful<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.799> others

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
coasters aren't as forceful as others

many<00:02:29.730> people<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.599> X<00:02:30.870> flight<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
many people really like X flight and

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.170 
many people really like X flight and
consider<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.250> their<00:02:32.400> favorite<00:02:32.940> wing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390 
consider it one of their favorite wing
coasters<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.290> my<00:02:34.409> opinion<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.129> as

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
coasters but in my opinion is not as

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.020 
coasters but in my opinion is not as
strong<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.299> BM<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.079> most<00:02:37.680> others<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.819> for

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
compact as a great layout and so most

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
compact as a great layout and so most
people<00:03:14.400> would<00:03:14.640> choose<00:03:14.670> an<00:03:15.060> inverted<00:03:15.540> coaster
