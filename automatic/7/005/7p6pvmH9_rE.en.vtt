00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.399 
going to write about next and I just
started<00:01:37.369> watching<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.030> hairstylist<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
started watching the hairstylist and the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.350 
started watching the hairstylist and the
way<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:39.740> interacted<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:40.610> each<00:01:40.670> other<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
way they interacted with each other and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960 
way they interacted with each other and
how<00:01:41.930> they<00:01:42.049> were<00:01:42.110> almost<00:01:42.290> like<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.650> family<00:01:43.100> then

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
how they were almost like a family then

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.399 
how they were almost like a family then
I<00:01:44.000> started<00:01:44.420> wondering<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.260> would<00:01:45.350> be

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
I started wondering what it would be

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.859 
I started wondering what it would be
like<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.740> be<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.040> part<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.700> world<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.360> then

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
like to be a part of that world and then

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.480 
like to be a part of that world and then
I<00:01:47.900> thought<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:48.650> there<00:01:48.830> was<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.010> small

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
I thought what if there was a small

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.240 
I thought what if there was a small
chain<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.060> family-owned<00:01:51.049> hair<00:01:51.439> salons<00:01:51.920> and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
chain of family-owned hair salons and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.249 
chain of family-owned hair salons and
what<00:01:52.760> if<00:01:52.880> all<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.240> siblings<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.049> half

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
what if all the siblings and half

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.590 
what if all the siblings and half
siblings<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.130> father's<00:01:55.549> ex-wives<00:01:56.210> all

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
siblings and the father's ex-wives all

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.679 
siblings and the father's ex-wives all
worked<00:01:56.900> there<00:01:57.259> more<00:01:58.220> what<00:01:58.460> ifs<00:01:58.640> followed<00:01:59.210> both

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
worked there more what ifs followed both

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.020 
worked there more what ifs followed both
my<00:01:59.990> own<00:02:00.200> ideas<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.740> some<00:02:01.159> great<00:02:01.460> suggestions

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
my own ideas and some great suggestions

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.690 
my own ideas and some great suggestions
from<00:02:02.479> other<00:02:02.689> people<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.350> before<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.159> knew<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.520> I
