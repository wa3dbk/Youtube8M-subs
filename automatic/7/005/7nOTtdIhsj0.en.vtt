00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
this past September we announced our

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.010 
this past September we announced our
closure<00:00:06.370> platform<00:00:06.880> and<00:00:07.300> we<00:00:07.660> couldn't<00:00:07.840> be<00:00:07.990> more

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.020 
closure platform and we couldn't be more

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.020 
closure platform and we couldn't be more
happy<00:00:08.170> with<00:00:08.530> the<00:00:08.680> way<00:00:08.800> it's<00:00:08.920> going<00:00:09.100> it<00:00:09.880> was<00:00:10.000> a

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
happy with the way it's going it was a

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.630 
happy with the way it's going it was a
new<00:00:10.240> SOC<00:00:10.900> that<00:00:11.110> we<00:00:11.200> built<00:00:11.470> from<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.220> ground<00:00:12.460> up

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
new SOC that we built from the ground up

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.690 
new SOC that we built from the ground up
to<00:00:12.970> run<00:00:13.120> Windows<00:00:13.480> Windows<00:00:13.840> 8<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:15.160> idea<00:00:15.430> was

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
to run Windows Windows 8 the idea was

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.670 
to run Windows Windows 8 the idea was
that<00:00:15.730> we<00:00:16.030> could<00:00:16.150> produce<00:00:16.330> a<00:00:16.600> part<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.560> had

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
that we could produce a part that had

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.140 
that we could produce a part that had
fantastic<00:00:17.950> battery<00:00:18.490> life<00:00:18.640> it<00:00:18.910> gave<00:00:19.030> you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
fantastic battery life it gave you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
presentation so the Intel devices

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.439 
presentation so the Intel devices
provide<00:00:46.899> some<00:00:47.109> unique<00:00:47.319> advantages<00:00:48.359> what<00:00:49.359> is

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
provide some unique advantages what is

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.599 
provide some unique advantages what is
it<00:00:49.539> that<00:00:49.629> makes<00:00:49.839> these<00:00:50.049> devices<00:00:50.499> great<00:00:50.769> you

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
it that makes these devices great you

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.160 
it that makes these devices great you
know<00:00:51.729> the<00:00:51.909> user<00:00:52.089> experience<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:52.929> about

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
know the user experience it's about

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.709 
know the user experience it's about
responsiveness<00:00:53.889> it's<00:00:54.309> about<00:00:54.639> having<00:00:55.149> a<00:00:55.329> fluid

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
responsiveness it's about having a fluid

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.779 
responsiveness it's about having a fluid
experience<00:00:56.260> when<00:00:56.379> you're<00:00:56.499> doing<00:00:56.709> touch<00:00:56.949> it's

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
experience when you're doing touch it's

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.719 
experience when you're doing touch it's
about<00:00:58.059> having<00:00:59.010> battery<00:01:00.010> life<00:01:00.190> that's<00:01:00.429> great

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
about having battery life that's great

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.000 
about having battery life that's great
it's<00:01:00.999> about<00:01:01.239> having<00:01:01.389> long<00:01:01.659> standby<00:01:02.079> time<00:01:02.319> and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
it's about having long standby time and

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.500 
it's about having long standby time and
it's<00:01:03.159> also<00:01:03.369> about<00:01:03.549> having<00:01:03.819> the<00:01:04.030> performance

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
it's also about having the performance

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's also about having the performance
you<00:01:04.629> need<00:01:04.809> when<00:01:05.620> you<00:01:05.740> at<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.580> time<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:06.820> need

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
you need when you at the time you need

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.820 
you need when you at the time you need
it<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.330> it's<00:01:07.450> instant<00:01:07.690> performance<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:08.410> then

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
it so it's instant performance and then

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.500 
it so it's instant performance and then
back<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.070> this<00:01:09.370> different<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.880> been<00:01:10.060> awesome

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
back to this different it's been awesome

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.620 
back to this different it's been awesome
and<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:11.380> course<00:01:11.650> compatibility<00:01:12.580> which<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.480> one

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
and of course compatibility which is one

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.870 
and of course compatibility which is one
of<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.750> strengths<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.140> our<00:01:14.260> platform<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
of the strengths of our platform this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.920 
of the strengths of our platform this
platform<00:01:15.940> does<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.630> all

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
platform does it all

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.660 
platform does it all
so<00:01:17.110> we've<00:01:17.770> already<00:01:17.950> announced<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:18.430> but

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
so we've already announced this but

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.900 
so we've already announced this but
again<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:19.060> has<00:01:19.290> 1.8<00:01:20.290> gigahertz<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.490> has<00:01:21.670> power

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
again it has 1.8 gigahertz it has power

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.080 
again it has 1.8 gigahertz it has power
efficiency<00:01:22.300> multitasking<00:01:23.110> 10<00:01:24.070> plus<00:01:24.460> hours<00:01:24.850> of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
efficiency multitasking 10 plus hours of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.730 
efficiency multitasking 10 plus hours of
battery<00:01:25.570> life<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.080> greater<00:01:26.410> than<00:01:26.470> three

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
battery life and greater than three

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.430 
battery life and greater than three
weeks<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:27.010> standby<00:01:28.980> so<00:01:29.980> of<00:01:30.970> course<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.320> the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
weeks of standby so of course one of the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.870 
weeks of standby so of course one of the
main<00:01:32.560> things<00:01:32.800> about<00:01:32.860> these<00:01:33.100> tablets<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.640> can

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
main things about these tablets is can

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.820 
main things about these tablets is can
it<00:01:34.000> run<00:01:34.180> what<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.630> own<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.320> tell<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.590> I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
it run what you own I have to tell you I

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.460 
it run what you own I have to tell you I
have<00:01:36.370> have<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> have<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.060> tablet<00:01:37.270> here<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.380> our

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
have have to have a tablet here and our

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.900 
have have to have a tablet here and our
platform<00:01:38.980> provides<00:01:39.250> full<00:01:39.610> compatibility

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
we think the bait reel platform is going

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.149 
we think the bait reel platform is going
to<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.599> incredibly<00:03:37.019> exciting<00:03:37.439> for<00:03:37.799> ourselves

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
to be incredibly exciting for ourselves
