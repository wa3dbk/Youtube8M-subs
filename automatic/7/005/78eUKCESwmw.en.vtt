00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.619
 we still do not have the confirmation of whether 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 there are people that there are victims of this 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.170
 helicopter that crashed near the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 aesthetic beach a helicopter of the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 armada that fell into the sea and in front of the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 Chépica beach apparently they were 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.480
 doing rescue work that 's right 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 they are in those tasks when I mole water and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 now we already have the contact 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.020
 precisely with rose road of our 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 half associated visual turn so that we 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 tell more details how good 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.079
 afternoon hello sebastián good afternoon and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 matilde also good afternoon for 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 you this is how well they did not work 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.710
 it is not a sad news that is lived 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.760
 here in the province of san antonio 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.560
 specifically the aesthetic beach of the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.600
 commune of the tabo was when 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.240
 of rescue maneuvers of some 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.610
 imprudent bathers was when the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.009
 helicopter was returned to the panul lighthouse and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 then he came back with another rescue team 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:23.369
 and apparently because of a mechanical failure this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.689
 yellow in the sea and because of that later 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.030
 Unfortunately, this 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.450
 helicopter you do not have the ones in the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.390
 lower part of the legs so 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.420
 caused the sinking of the ship what 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 yes people from here told me 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.119
 armed is that the three occupants between 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.209
 the pilot the co-pilot and the diver are 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.909
 unharmed there are no injured regarding this 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.610
 So far what is known is that 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.680
 there are some ships that are trying to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.280
 support the helicopter that is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.930
 is unfortunately sunk but they are 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.370
 doing everything possible so that it does not 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 go to the bottom of the sea 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.200
 that is a news in development a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 lamentable news that is being lived 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.150
 here in the commune of el tabo in the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.459
 province of san antonio but for sure 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.000
 Knitted rose would not have injured 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.580
 Until now 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.870

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.290

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.040
 had to perform to make a rescue 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.870
 of people who would not have been what 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.500
 sufficiently cautious and that they could 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.330
 have caused a tragedy beyond 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.390
 of your own so thank you very much
