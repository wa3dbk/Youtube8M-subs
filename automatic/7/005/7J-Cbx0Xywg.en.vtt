00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.729
 [Music] 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.939
 this is not a tutorial the end of this 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.710
 video is to give you an idea that 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.360
 you can give and how you can give it away 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.980
 if you want me to teach you specifically 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.090
 do something just let me know the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.110
 comments and I will gladly 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.820
 teach him 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.480
 The first thing I did was to get a 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 box then I put a bed of Band-Aids 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.279
 red and black china paper because 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.259
 because that's what the colors of 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.780
 wanda direct in 2000 he liked 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:36.079
 dario cioni I decided to do it is like 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.120
 then I wanted a stroller and now 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.360
 wants to buy a bandeira set but 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.790
 now it is very expensive to make it a hole 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.820
 accommodate it so that it fits in the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.890
 box 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.120
 then I put a lipstick 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 [Music] 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.309
 then a letter is said one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.600
 visit at 12 to improved hills decided 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.019
 of the world 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.019
 i 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 [Music] 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.290
 finally also cuts lists of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.860
 red white color and blue sky 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.900
 and then like so they formed a 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 flag of 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.410
 england and I know that it looks medium 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.250
 weird and maybe he does not look so father 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.250
 but it was air 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:44.150
 [Music] 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.610
 finally the index is so beautiful that 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.540
 the thoughts to the kids of one 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.880
 million and he owed them a story they want 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.010
 know how I made the decision to know is 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.960
 well what the comments mention 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.580
 because they are crimes 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.670
 I put this up 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.700
