cheese<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.659> nerved<00:00:32.169> from<00:00:32.410> norway<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.820> a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
cheese is nerved from norway and it is a

cheese is nerved from norway and it is a
condensed<00:00:34.810> way<00:00:35.079> cheese<00:00:35.470> meaning<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.010> way<00:00:36.130> has

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
condensed way cheese meaning the way has

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.880 
condensed way cheese meaning the way has
been<00:00:36.579> boiled<00:00:36.850> down<00:00:37.180> and<00:00:37.629> and<00:00:38.079> cooked<00:00:38.649> down

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
been boiled down and and cooked down

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.189 
been boiled down and and cooked down
until<00:00:39.309> it's<00:00:39.489> condensed<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.300> caramelized

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
until it's condensed and caramelized

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.470 
until it's condensed and caramelized
like<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.460> that's<00:00:42.579> how<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.879> becomes<00:00:43.120> like

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
like this so that's how it becomes like

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.759 
like this so that's how it becomes like
this<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:43.899> they<00:00:43.960> sometimes<00:00:44.170> will<00:00:44.410> add<00:00:44.559> like

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
this and they sometimes will add like

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.950 
this and they sometimes will add like
extra<00:00:45.190> milk<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.210> adjust<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.600> fat<00:00:46.750> content

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
extra milk to adjust the fat content

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.360 
extra milk to adjust the fat content
whatnot<00:00:47.469> but<00:00:48.340> anyways<00:00:48.670> this<00:00:49.030> cheese<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:51.250> a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
whatnot but anyways this cheese it's a

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.160 
whatnot but anyways this cheese it's a
pretty<00:00:51.550> high<00:00:51.789> sugar<00:00:52.269> but<00:00:52.510> not<00:00:52.660> terribly<00:00:52.989> high

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
pretty high sugar but not terribly high

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.090 
pretty high sugar but not terribly high
in<00:00:53.320> fat<00:00:53.559> it's<00:00:53.739> like<00:00:53.829> dying<00:00:54.039> grams<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.609> fat<00:00:56.100> 12

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100
