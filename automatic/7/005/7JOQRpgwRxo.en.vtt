00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello to all of us we 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 can be found on the cantilien racecourse 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 monday april 28th for the price of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.910
 goats a race consisting of sixteen 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 starters who argue over the old 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 jockey club course price 2400 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 meters so to chantilly so that's 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.480
 instinct the water anyway any flow and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.790
 it's not easy either to clear 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.680
 bases but still the asi 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.059
 teofilo could still do some 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.690
 part is a horse that is very 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.220
 regular he stays on two excellent 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.710
 attempt at this level they wear 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.420
 a lot of weight certainly but to 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.239
 Chantilly maybe it's still 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.440
 easier just to wear a lot 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.330
 of weight and it's a horse that is 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.610
 enough going we should find it at 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.910
 outposts and he can he can go to 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.820
 end 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.010
 in any case he really deserves it 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 number 11 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 nardo is a horse that I feel on the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.030
 rising he evolved flank of platoon 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.180
 last in the europe price 1 to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.630
 longchamp the race reference he had 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 so carried over more distance 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.350
 that his rivals and my faith he had done 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.850
 there was therefore a brave 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.800
 associated with stone charles boudot a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.479
 very fit jockey who won again 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.520
 nor stadium with an outsider yesterday at 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.479
 Toulouse is an interesting conclusion 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.709
 on number 11 nardol rossi sclavis who to 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.690
 who is giving the blinkers had well 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.940
 last performed under saddle 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.390
 stéphane pasquier he finds 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.920
 it is a winner of quinté so in 2012 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 what life is at the time 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.200
 besides month of April depends on 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 eric libaud's training a 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.420
 workout that is in a form 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.640
 thundering the number 6 clavis no 12 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.979
 French accent coaching guy 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.890
 henrot it's a horse that I like 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 for my part all he will have to win his 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.060
 fifth 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.620
 he made a discreet reappearance even 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.739
 a little disappointing to a simple or 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.340
 must say things but then and 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.170
 well then he knows he's well 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 better behaved he ran in net 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.500
 progress in marked improvement and this 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.180
 French accent 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.340
 I'm expecting a good performance 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.129
 why not three four or five or 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.709
 better their five girardot had done well 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.080
 last in the reference race 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.629
 so always this European loan on the 6th 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.090
 April made good showing too 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.000
 good and there this time he pulled the number 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.340
 16 in the departure stalls so that's 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.939
 complicates a little task number 7 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.219
 amiens very well born by galileo but 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:57.190
 good he is he is evolving so in value 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.530
 36 but be aware that during his 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.060
 his essay in the quintés ago 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.760
 some time he had been caught in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.300
 value 41st and so it's eleven pounds 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.360
 from me he stays on a good attempt 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.340
 to Toulouse 3rd in a lot that held the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.830
 road so this amiens is enough 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.960
 fun why not the moment 13 gentle 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.560
 hot since the beginning of the year there are 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.350
 have nothing to reproach this mare 5 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.090
 years who in the past did a good job 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.940
 in the quintés more so why not 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.080
 and the number four course and that's 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.710
 fun it's a horse that was in 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.870
 breaking of obstacles the last and 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.130
 unique time that he had been associated with 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.470
 christophe soumillon well it was essential 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.330
 he easily imposed himself in a job 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.260
 good this course and why not 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:52.000
 just for a lot so that's the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.050
 number 1 theophilos so the basis for 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 finish in the first four on 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:01.000
 can make a field reduced in two on 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.230
 four consisting of the ace of the eleventh of the 6th and 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.989
 of the 12 are reduced here 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.549
 can mix with the selection so 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.610
 as follows the selection that I 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.299
 so recapitulates the number 1 the ace 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.030
 theophilos on 11 nardo on 6 clavis on 12 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.570
 french accent on 5 jardot le set 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.880
 amiens le 13 gentle hot and number 4 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.880
 by Cory thank you to everyone
