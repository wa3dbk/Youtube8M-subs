00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
which ever you want to do it's fine I

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.850 
which ever you want to do it's fine I
would<00:03:59.900> say<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.640> this<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.209> all<00:04:02.510> right<00:04:02.720> or<00:04:03.049> you

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
would say that this is all right or you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.270 
would say that this is all right or you
can<00:04:04.040> use<00:04:04.220> peace<00:04:04.670> open<00:04:05.180> go2<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.440> think<00:04:06.980> this

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
can use peace open go2 but I think this

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.850 
can use peace open go2 but I think this
one<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.879> the<00:04:08.060> best<00:04:08.269> one<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.660> works<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.680> more

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
one is the best one that works the more

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.699 
one is the best one that works the more
reliable<00:04:10.099> one<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.730> I'd<00:04:10.879> say<00:04:11.349> it's<00:04:12.349> probably

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
reliable one is I'd say it's probably

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.890 
reliable one is I'd say it's probably
that<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.129> you<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:13.700> go<00:04:13.819> into<00:04:13.970> config<00:04:14.540> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
that and you can go into config and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.960 
that and you can go into config and
fiddle<00:04:15.799> around<00:04:15.860> with<00:04:16.100> settings<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.880> your

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
fiddle around with settings to your

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.400 
fiddle around with settings to your
liking<00:04:17.030> then<00:04:18.160> next<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.310> have<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.760> sound<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.750> I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
liking then next we have the sound and I

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.350 
liking then next we have the sound and I
always<00:04:22.010> get<00:04:22.190> messed<00:04:22.400> up<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.180> can

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
always get messed up with this I can

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.850 
always get messed up with this I can
never<00:04:23.540> remember<00:04:23.720> which<00:04:23.990> one<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.740> think

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
never remember which one it is I think

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.140 
never remember which one it is I think
it<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.970> EBS<00:04:26.300> X<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:27.100> SP<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.340> call<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.850> works

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
it is the EBS X a SP you call that works

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.390 
it is the EBS X a SP you call that works
the<00:04:29.450> sound<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.680> again<00:04:31.389> config<00:04:32.740> no<00:04:33.740> config<00:04:34.250> say

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the sound so again config no config say

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.370 
the sound so again config no config say
yes<00:04:34.580> thick<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.360> ePSXe

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
yes thick is the ePSXe

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.190 
yes thick is the ePSXe
SP<00:04:36.800> for<00:04:37.280> one<00:04:37.460> point<00:04:37.700> seven<00:04:37.970> point<00:04:38.120> zero<00:04:38.210> and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
SP for one point seven point zero and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.529 
SP for one point seven point zero and
again<00:04:39.560> next<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.580> then<00:04:40.910> it'll<00:04:41.150> pop<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.510> the

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
again next and then it'll pop with the

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.930 
again next and then it'll pop with the
cd-rom<00:04:42.020> but<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.919> don't<00:04:43.190> think<00:04:43.460> we<00:04:43.550> will<00:04:43.700> need

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
cd-rom but I don't think we will need

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.640 
cd-rom but I don't think we will need
that<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:46.190> click<00:04:46.669> Next<00:04:47.180> again<00:04:47.270> here<00:04:48.229> is

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
that so just click Next again here is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.650 
that so just click Next again here is
one<00:04:49.220> thing<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.490> do<00:04:49.639> really<00:04:50.030> love<00:04:50.240> about<00:04:50.419> this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
one thing I do really love about this

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.930 
one thing I do really love about this
piece<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.110> software<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:52.100> controller

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
piece of software you have controller

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.610 
piece of software you have controller
setup<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.539> don't<00:04:53.750> have<00:04:53.870> my<00:04:53.990> controller<00:04:54.380> plugged

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
setup I don't have my controller plugged

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.800 
setup I don't have my controller plugged
in<00:04:54.770> at<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.039> moment<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.580> can't<00:04:55.970> show<00:04:56.389> you<00:04:56.450> how

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
in at the moment so I can't show you how

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.640 
in at the moment so I can't show you how
it<00:04:56.960> works<00:04:57.190> but<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:59.330> can<00:04:59.630> probably<00:04:59.900> do<00:05:00.410> this

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
it works but you can probably do this

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.150 
it works but you can probably do this
it's<00:05:01.010> very<00:05:01.460> simple<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.150> just<00:05:02.690> click<00:05:03.160> which

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
it's very simple you just click which

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.339 
it's very simple you just click which
button<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.700> going<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.060> configure<00:05:05.330> press<00:05:06.200> the

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
button you going to configure press the

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.230 
button you going to configure press the
ball<00:05:06.500> only<00:05:06.650> corresponds<00:05:07.310> on<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.820> controller

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
ball only corresponds on the controller

to<00:05:08.720> on<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.919> diagram<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.729> this<00:05:11.690> will<00:05:11.930> change

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
to on the diagram and this will change

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.750 
to on the diagram and this will change
to<00:05:13.010> look<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.660> number<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.830> code<00:05:16.280> for

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
to look to be that number the code for

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.580 
to look to be that number the code for
that<00:05:17.030> bottom

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
that bottom

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.560 
that bottom
you<00:05:19.190> can<00:05:19.340> do<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.580> for<00:05:19.730> two<00:05:19.850> controllers<00:05:20.270> that

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
you can do that for two controllers that

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.420 
you can do that for two controllers that
doesn't<00:05:20.870> mean<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.170> can<00:05:21.320> play<00:05:21.500> multiplayer<00:05:21.920> on

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
doesn't mean you can play multiplayer on

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.130 
doesn't mean you can play multiplayer on
games<00:05:22.850> that<00:05:22.970> support<00:05:23.480> it<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:25.060> yeah<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:26.690> next

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
games that support it and yeah so next

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.570 
games that support it and yeah so next
again<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.890> should<00:05:28.400> be<00:05:28.610> config<00:05:29.360> finished<00:05:29.990> and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
again that should be config finished and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.170 
again that should be config finished and
it<00:05:31.580> should<00:05:31.820> be<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.240> fine<00:05:32.720> working<00:05:33.020> order<00:05:34.180> there

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
it should be in fine working order there

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.070 
it should be in fine working order there
will<00:05:35.420> be<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:36.340> another<00:05:37.340> annotation<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.480> this<00:05:38.750> top
