studio corner calm and today I want to
talk<00:00:09.000> about<00:00:09.120> gating<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.870> using<00:00:10.830> gates<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
talk about gating and using gates and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.720 
talk about gating and using gates and
expanders<00:00:11.760> in<00:00:12.750> your<00:00:13.500> music<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.129> audio<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
expanders in your music and audio and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.330 
expanders in your music and audio and
why<00:00:15.150> you'd<00:00:15.299> want<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.510> use<00:00:15.629> them<00:00:15.750> gates<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.619> in

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
why you'd want to use them gates are in

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.310 
why you'd want to use them gates are in
expanders<00:00:18.030> are<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> same<00:00:19.110> thing

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
expanders are kind of the same thing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.480 
expanders are kind of the same thing
it's<00:00:19.440> kind<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> compressor<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it's kind of like a compressor and a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.669 
it's kind of like a compressor and a
limiter<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.420> same<00:00:21.660> thing<00:00:21.960> sort<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
limiter are the same thing sort of a

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.919 
limiter are the same thing sort of a
limiter<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.429> an<00:00:23.640> extreme<00:00:24.060> version<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
limiter is just an extreme version of a

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.980 
limiter is just an extreme version of a
compressor<00:00:25.789> basically<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.419> gate<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.900> an

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
compressor basically and a gate is an

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.980 
compressor basically and a gate is an
extreme<00:00:28.410> version<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.759> expander<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.869> I've

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
extreme version of an expander so I've

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
extreme version of an expander so I've
got<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.259> plug-in<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.400> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
got this plug-in here and this is a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
got this plug-in here and this is a
plug-in<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.940> waves<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.510> gives<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.810> both<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
plug-in from waves that gives you both a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.980 
plug-in from waves that gives you both a
compressor<00:00:34.890> section<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:36.420> gate<00:00:36.660> slash

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
compressor section and a gate slash

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.710 
compressor section and a gate slash
expander<00:00:37.740> section<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:39.390> gonna<00:00:39.450> see

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
expander section so what we're gonna see

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.120 
expander section so what we're gonna see
here<00:00:39.750> first<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.380> we<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.740> know<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
here first off we all know how a

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.280 
here first off we all know how a
compressor<00:00:41.640> works<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.450> here's<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.870> signal

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
compressor works this here's the signal

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
compressor works this here's the signal
and<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> jumps<00:00:44.250> above<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.790> level<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and as it jumps above this level it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
and as it jumps above this level it
turns<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> signal<00:00:46.740> down<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.580> that's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
turns the signal down and that that's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
turns the signal down and that that's
nothing<00:00:47.970> nothing<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.910> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
nothing nothing really all that new so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.730 
nothing nothing really all that new so
we're<00:00:51.150> listening<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.450> my<00:00:51.810> podcast<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.500> last

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
we're listening to my podcast from last

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.100 
we're listening to my podcast from last
week<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.880> as<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.630> whenever<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
week and so as we can see whenever I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.690 
week and so as we can see whenever I
talk<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> signal<00:00:55.980> goes<00:00:56.010> above<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
talk and the signal goes above this

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.760 
talk and the signal goes above this
little<00:00:56.940> triangle<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.390> you'll<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.560> this<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
little triangle here you'll see this is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
little triangle here you'll see this is
the<00:00:58.950> gain<00:00:59.130> reduction<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.670> turns<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:02.600> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the gain reduction it turns it down so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
the gain reduction it turns it down so
it's<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.780> fairly<00:01:04.080> dramatic<00:01:04.530> example<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's a fairly dramatic example which you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's a fairly dramatic example which you
can<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.770> turn<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.130> up

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
can see that here so if I turn that up

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.970 
can see that here so if I turn that up
you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.460> hear<00:01:08.910> it<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.080> compressing<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.770> set<00:01:10.950> up

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
you can hear it is compressing we set up

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.400 
you can hear it is compressing we set up
in<00:01:11.160> his<00:01:11.280> studio<00:01:11.550> using<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> Bluebird<00:01:12.840> I'm

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
in his studio using the Bluebird I'm

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.200 
in his studio using the Bluebird I'm
sorry<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.800> Baby<00:01:14.010> Bottle<00:01:14.220> microphone<00:01:14.880> from

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
sorry the Baby Bottle microphone from

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
sorry the Baby Bottle microphone from
blue<00:01:15.450> okay<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.650> obviously<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.400> little

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
blue okay so obviously that's a little

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
blue okay so obviously that's a little
extreme<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> compression<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.230> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
extreme on the compression side but you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.280 
extreme on the compression side but you
get<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.710> point<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.780> diagram<00:01:21.960> over

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
get the point so in this diagram over

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
get the point so in this diagram over
here<00:01:22.440> shows<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.190> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
here shows that so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
here shows that so
if<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.670> yellow<00:01:27.479> line<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.970> our

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
if we look this yellow line is our

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
if we look this yellow line is our
compressor<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.590> signal<00:01:31.950> comes<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
compressor so as the signal comes up it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.430 
compressor so as the signal comes up it
stays<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> same<00:01:33.180> volume<00:01:33.450> same<00:01:33.840> volume<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
stays the same volume same volume and it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.080 
stays the same volume same volume and it
gets<00:01:34.590> above<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.159> threshold<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
gets above this threshold here which is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
gets above this threshold here which is
this<00:01:36.210> orange<00:01:36.600> triangle<00:01:37.050> then<00:01:37.530> he<00:01:37.619> gets<00:01:37.770> turned

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this orange triangle then he gets turned

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
this orange triangle then he gets turned
down<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.250> certain<00:01:38.520> amount<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.750> watch

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
down a certain amount and you can watch

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
down a certain amount and you can watch
it<00:01:40.080> set<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.409> his<00:01:40.560> studio<00:01:40.800> using<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> Blue

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it set up in his studio using the Blue

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.390 
it set up in his studio using the Blue
Bird<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.540> sorry<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.080> baby<00:01:43.290> bottle<00:01:43.680> okay<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
Bird I'm sorry the baby bottle okay so

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.590 
Bird I'm sorry the baby bottle okay so
we<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:44.910> a<00:01:44.940> compressor<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.420> an

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
we know what a compressor does an

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.410 
we know what a compressor does an
expander<00:01:46.410> does<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.700> exact<00:01:48.000> opposite

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
expander does the exact opposite

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
expander does the exact opposite
whenever<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> signal<00:01:49.080> drops<00:01:49.440> below<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
whenever the signal drops below the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
whenever the signal drops below the
threshold<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.880> turns<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
threshold it turns it down so in this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
threshold it turns it down so in this
example<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.190> top<00:01:53.990> triangle<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.320> our

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
example this top triangle here is our

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
example this top triangle here is our
threshold<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.119> turn<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> on

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
threshold so when we turn this on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.510 
threshold so when we turn this on
whenever<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> signal<00:01:58.560> drops<00:01:58.800> below<00:02:00.050> this

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
whenever the signal drops below this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.029 
whenever the signal drops below this
below<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.880> top<00:02:03.149> triangle<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.590> turns<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
below this top triangle then it turns it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.219 
below this top triangle then it turns it
down<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.119> make<00:02:06.300> this<00:02:06.450> fairly<00:02:06.720> extreme

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
down so if we make this fairly extreme

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.219 
down so if we make this fairly extreme
you<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:07.950> hear<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.789> work<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.869> set<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.110> in

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you can hear that at work we set up in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.770 
you can hear that at work we set up in
his<00:02:10.380> studio<00:02:10.619> using<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.280> Bluebird<00:02:11.940> I'm<00:02:12.330> sorry

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
his studio using the Bluebird I'm sorry

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.650 
his studio using the Bluebird I'm sorry
the<00:02:12.900> Baby<00:02:13.110> Bottle<00:02:13.380> microphone<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.250> blue<00:02:14.660> and

the Baby Bottle microphone from blue and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.350 
the Baby Bottle microphone from blue and
then<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.900> ran<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.230> into<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.709> stock<00:02:17.180> preamp<00:02:18.180> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
then we ran it into the stock preamp as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.050 
then we ran it into the stock preamp as
it<00:02:18.510> comes<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:19.500> Presonus<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.850> as

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it comes from Presonus with this so as

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670 
it comes from Presonus with this so as
I'm<00:02:21.269> getting<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.050> quiet<00:02:22.260> part<00:02:22.470> that's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I'm getting to the quiet part that's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.990 
I'm getting to the quiet part that's
turning<00:02:22.920> me<00:02:23.100> down<00:02:23.130> set<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.640> his<00:02:23.760> studio

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
turning me down set up in his studio

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.479 
turning me down set up in his studio
using<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> Bluebird<00:02:25.320> I'm<00:02:25.769> sorry<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> Baby

Bottle<00:02:26.730> microphone<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.690> blue<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:29.160> we

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
Bottle microphone from blue and then we

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.620 
Bottle microphone from blue and then we
ran<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.579> into<00:02:31.370> okay<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.329> give<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.540> an

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
ran it into okay so to give you an

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.479 
ran it into okay so to give you an
example<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.989> why<00:02:34.110> that's<00:02:34.260> useful<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
example of why that's useful in that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.100 
example of why that's useful in that
particular<00:02:35.910> scenario<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
particular scenario it's not but the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.740 
particular scenario it's not but the
idea<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.470> whenever<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.579> any<00:02:38.850> pauses<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
idea is whenever I do any pauses in the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.710 
idea is whenever I do any pauses in the
audio<00:02:40.019> whenever<00:02:40.709> i<00:02:40.799> pause<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.120> effect<00:02:42.239> or

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
audio whenever i pause for effect or

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.900 
audio whenever i pause for effect or
whatnot<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.620> problem<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.220> i'm<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.670> my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
whatnot the problem there is i'm in my

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.479 
whatnot the problem there is i'm in my
studio<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:45.269> computer<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.019> two<00:02:47.010> feet<00:02:47.220> away<00:02:47.340> from

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
studio my computer is two feet away from

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.550 
studio my computer is two feet away from
the<00:02:47.730> microphone<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:48.989> gonna<00:02:49.110> hear<00:02:49.410> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
the microphone so you're gonna hear that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960 
the microphone so you're gonna hear that
especially<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> podcast<00:02:50.280> where<00:02:50.700> things<00:02:50.850> are

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
especially in a podcast where things are

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
especially in a podcast where things are
very<00:02:51.000> quiet<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.930> let's<00:02:52.079> take<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> listen<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
very quiet so let's take a listen to the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.199 
very quiet so let's take a listen to the
audio<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:53.010> by<00:02:53.190> itself<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:53.700> sorry<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> Baby

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
audio just by itself I'm sorry the Baby

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.930 
audio just by itself I'm sorry the Baby
Bottle<00:02:54.450> microphone<00:02:55.079> from<00:02:55.350> Bleu<00:02:55.650> Edam

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
Bottle microphone from Bleu Edam

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.729 
Bottle microphone from Bleu Edam
so<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.600> space<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.079> between<00:02:58.200> if<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.590> turn

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
so that's space in between if I turn

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.610 
so that's space in between if I turn
that<00:02:58.890> up<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> little<00:02:59.340> bit<00:02:59.610> more<00:03:00.980> you'll<00:03:01.980> hear

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
that up a little bit more you'll hear

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.940 
that up a little bit more you'll hear
let<00:03:04.620> me<00:03:04.680> turn<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.980> up<00:03:05.040> here

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
let me turn it up here

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
let me turn it up here
you'll<00:03:07.950> hear<00:03:08.190> there's<00:03:08.370> quite<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.579> bit<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.850> noise

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
you'll hear there's quite a bit of noise

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.729 
you'll hear there's quite a bit of noise
just<00:03:09.390> breath<00:03:09.630> noise<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> room<00:03:10.530> noise

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
just breath noise in just the room noise

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.819 
just breath noise in just the room noise
between<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:12.090> two<00:03:12.480> signals<00:03:12.840> Oh<00:03:12.989> between<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
between the two signals Oh between the

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.699 
between the two signals Oh between the
two<00:03:13.950> phrases<00:03:14.130> little<00:03:14.519> microphone<00:03:15.030> from<00:03:15.299> blue

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
two phrases little microphone from blue

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.350 
two phrases little microphone from blue

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
what we want to do is use a gate to turn

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.990 
what we want to do is use a gate to turn
down<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.800> audio<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.310> section<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.790> don't

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
down the audio in that section I don't

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.400 
down the audio in that section I don't
need<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.180> hear<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.480> room<00:03:42.810> noise<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.260> let's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
need to hear that room noise so let's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.199 
need to hear that room noise so let's
just<00:03:43.560> go<00:03:43.650> ahead<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.830> turn<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.040> down<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.180> we

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
just go ahead and turn that down so we

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.199 
just go ahead and turn that down so we
set<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.660> threshold<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.410> gate<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.830> open

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
set the threshold of this gate to open

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.580 
set the threshold of this gate to open
around<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.360> area<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.750> turn<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.230> down<00:03:49.379> by

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
around this area and turn it down by

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.960 
around this area and turn it down by
about<00:03:49.830> 10<00:03:50.129> or<00:03:50.250> 12<00:03:50.280> dB

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
about 10 or 12 dB

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420 
about 10 or 12 dB
so<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.780> those<00:03:52.620> dead<00:03:52.860> spots<00:03:53.129> it's<00:03:53.280> gonna

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
so now in those dead spots it's gonna

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.589 
so now in those dead spots it's gonna
turn<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.730> down<00:03:53.760> by<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.090> baby-bottle

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
turn it down by the baby-bottle

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.440 
turn it down by the baby-bottle
microphone<00:03:55.260> from<00:03:55.560> blue<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.060> we<00:03:57.150> ran<00:03:57.299> it

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
microphone from blue and then we ran it

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.740 
microphone from blue and then we ran it
into<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.810> stock<00:03:58.400> preamp<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.760> comes<00:03:59.970> from

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
into the stock preamp as it comes from

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.559 
into the stock preamp as it comes from
Presonus<00:04:01.290> with<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> stock<00:04:01.769> tube<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.569> so

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
Presonus with the stock tube and so

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.729 
Presonus with the stock tube and so
you'll<00:04:03.690> notice<00:04:03.870> every<00:04:04.110> time<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.319> stop<00:04:04.530> talking

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
you'll notice every time I stop talking

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.380 
you'll notice every time I stop talking
it<00:04:05.040> turns<00:04:05.280> down<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.670> audio<00:04:05.790> you'll<00:04:06.120> see<00:04:06.269> it's

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it turns down the audio you'll see it's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.670 
it turns down the audio you'll see it's
turned<00:04:06.599> down<00:04:06.780> right<00:04:06.989> now<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:07.379> it's

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
turned down right now because it's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.530 
turned down right now because it's
there's<00:04:08.340> no<00:04:08.519> audio<00:04:08.790> coming<00:04:09.060> through<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.450> as

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
there's no audio coming through and as

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.970 
there's no audio coming through and as
soon<00:04:09.690> as<00:04:09.810> audio<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.170> present<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.650> crosses

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
soon as audio is present and crosses

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860 
soon as audio is present and crosses
this<00:04:11.099> threshold<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.640> lets<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> pass<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.329> then

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
this threshold it lets it pass and then

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.240 
this threshold it lets it pass and then
when<00:04:12.959> I'm<00:04:13.049> quiet<00:04:13.170> again<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.769> turns<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.130> back

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
when I'm quiet again it turns it back

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.129 
when I'm quiet again it turns it back
down<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.670> example<00:04:15.269> right<00:04:15.480> here<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.840> drive

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
down for example right here the drive

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.310 
down for example right here the drive
knob<00:04:16.880> all<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.940> way<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.840> section<00:04:19.200> right

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
knob all the way that section right

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080 
knob all the way that section right
there<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.650> now<00:04:19.799> nice<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.130> quiet<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:20.760> opposed

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
there is now nice and quiet as opposed

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.230 
there is now nice and quiet as opposed
to<00:04:21.209> hearing<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:23.580> audio<00:04:23.850> there<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.180> I'm

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
to hearing all the audio there so I'm

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.640 
to hearing all the audio there so I'm
gonna<00:04:24.330> turn<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.630> up<00:04:24.690> just<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.990> little<00:04:25.020> bit<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
gonna turn it up just a little bit and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.219 
gonna turn it up just a little bit and
then<00:04:26.160> let<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.460> listen<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.810> before<00:04:28.110> and

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
then let you listen to it the before and

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.920 
then let you listen to it the before and
after<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.680> here's<00:04:28.950> without<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:30.270> expander<00:04:30.780> on

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
after so here's without the expander on

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.520 
after so here's without the expander on
Drive<00:04:31.560> knob<00:04:32.300> all<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.510> way<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.810> now<00:04:34.200> this<00:04:34.380> is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
Drive knob all the way and now this is

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.340 
Drive knob all the way and now this is
with<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.800> expander<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.340> drive<00:04:35.639> knob<00:04:36.320> all<00:04:37.320> the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
with the expander the drive knob all the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.980 
with the expander the drive knob all the
way<00:04:37.590> up<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:38.010> close<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.660> that's<00:04:39.750> how<00:04:39.960> I

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
way up or close to it so that's how I

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.180 
way up or close to it so that's how I
use<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.410> now<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.530> don't<00:04:40.740> use<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:40.979> particular

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
use it now I don't use this particular

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.300 
use it now I don't use this particular
plug-in<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:42.360> got<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.539> better<00:04:42.720> visual<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:44.130> show

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
plug-in it's got a better visual to show

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.520 
plug-in it's got a better visual to show
you<00:04:44.370> what's<00:04:44.729> going<00:04:44.940> on<00:04:45.030> there<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> actually

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
you what's going on there but I actually

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.320 
you what's going on there but I actually
use<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:48.590> SSL<00:04:49.590> plugin<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.490> used<00:04:50.789> this<00:04:50.970> for

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
use this SSL plugin so I used this for

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.580 
use this SSL plugin so I used this for
both<00:04:52.169> my<00:04:52.470> EQ<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.430> compression<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.419> also<00:04:54.990> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
both my EQ and compression and also the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.890 
both my EQ and compression and also the
gating<00:04:55.919> or<00:04:56.099> they<00:04:56.580> expanding<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.780> can

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
gating or they expanding so as you can

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.680 
gating or they expanding so as you can
see<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.410> line<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.970> row<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.360> lights

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
see this line this this row of lights

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.060 
see this line this this row of lights
here<00:05:00.900> represents<00:05:01.349> how<00:05:01.440> much<00:05:01.590> gating<00:05:01.979> is

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
here represents how much gating is

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.440 
here represents how much gating is
happening<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:02.550> right<00:05:02.729> now<00:05:02.849> it's<00:05:03.060> turning<00:05:03.360> it

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
happening so right now it's turning it

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.930 
happening so right now it's turning it
down<00:05:03.599> by<00:05:03.840> 20<00:05:04.260> dB<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.830> can<00:05:05.250> make<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.520> only<00:05:05.639> turn<00:05:05.820> it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
down by 20 dB I can make it only turn it

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.260 
down by 20 dB I can make it only turn it
down<00:05:06.060> by<00:05:06.180> 3<00:05:06.510> DB<00:05:06.690> or<00:05:07.349> 6<00:05:07.620> DB<00:05:07.950> but<00:05:08.910> we'll<00:05:09.030> put<00:05:09.150> it

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
down by 3 DB or 6 DB but we'll put it

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.300 
down by 3 DB or 6 DB but we'll put it
right<00:05:09.300> around<00:05:09.570> there<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.770> once<00:05:11.039> audio

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
right around there and so once audio

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.560 
right around there and so once audio
comes<00:05:11.550> through<00:05:11.729> you're<00:05:11.880> gonna<00:05:11.970> hear<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.330> again

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
comes through you're gonna hear it again

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.180 
comes through you're gonna hear it again
it's<00:05:13.080> gonna<00:05:13.229> do<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.440> exact<00:05:13.650> same<00:05:13.830> thing<00:05:14.070> and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
it's gonna do the exact same thing and

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.290 
it's gonna do the exact same thing and
you<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.370> see<00:05:14.580> here's<00:05:14.910> how<00:05:15.000> much<00:05:15.150> it's

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
you can see here's how much it's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.370 
you can see here's how much it's
compressing<00:05:15.750> here's<00:05:15.960> how<00:05:16.080> much<00:05:16.229> it's

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
compressing here's how much it's

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.110 
compressing here's how much it's
expanding<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.039> all<00:05:17.550> those<00:05:17.669> little<00:05:17.760> gaps

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
expanding and all those little gaps

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.730 
expanding and all those little gaps
between<00:05:18.389> the<00:05:18.780> phrases<00:05:18.990> are<00:05:19.380> now<00:05:19.530> nice<00:05:19.710> and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
between the phrases are now nice and

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.440 
between the phrases are now nice and
quiet<00:05:20.039> I<00:05:20.280> thought<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:20.880> guys<00:05:21.030> would<00:05:21.240> want<00:05:21.330> to

hear it as well so we took the we set up
in<00:05:24.690> his<00:05:24.840> studio<00:05:25.080> using<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:26.070> can<00:05:26.099> hear<00:05:26.370> it

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
in his studio using and you can hear it

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.810 
in his studio using and you can hear it
in<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:26.639> section<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.240> big<00:05:27.450> long<00:05:27.720> pause<00:05:27.990> here

microphone<00:05:31.560> from<00:05:31.860> blue<00:05:32.099> and<00:05:32.360> then<00:05:33.360> we<00:05:33.450> ran<00:05:33.599> it

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
microphone from blue and then we ran it

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.710 
microphone from blue and then we ran it
into<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.229> stock<00:05:34.729> preamp<00:05:35.729> as<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.060> come<00:05:36.240> so

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
into the stock preamp as it come so

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.089 
into the stock preamp as it come so
you'll<00:05:36.870> notice<00:05:37.020> here<00:05:37.139> where<00:05:37.650> I'm<00:05:37.740> taking<00:05:38.010> a

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
you'll notice here where I'm taking a

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.379 
you'll notice here where I'm taking a
breath<00:05:38.310> you<00:05:38.490> can<00:05:38.610> still<00:05:38.789> hear<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.180> breath

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
breath you can still hear the breath

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.060 
breath you can still hear the breath
because<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.840> didn't<00:05:40.080> mute<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.560> audio<00:05:40.590> it's

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
because it didn't mute the audio it's

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.560 
because it didn't mute the audio it's
not<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.310> same<00:05:41.550> as<00:05:41.729> coming<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.120> here<00:05:42.419> and

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
not the same as coming in here and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.200 
not the same as coming in here and
deleting<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.560> audio<00:05:43.830> entirely<00:05:44.280> it's<00:05:44.910> just

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
deleting that audio entirely it's just

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.270 
deleting that audio entirely it's just
turning<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.599> down<00:05:45.630> so<00:05:46.349> it<00:05:46.620> turns<00:05:46.830> down<00:05:47.070> the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
turning it down so it turns down the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.890 
turning it down so it turns down the
room<00:05:47.460> noise<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.880> turns<00:05:48.060> down<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.300> breath

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
room noise it turns down the breath

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.659 
room noise it turns down the breath
sounds<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.349> everything<00:05:49.620> else<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.400> sounds

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
sounds and everything else and it sounds

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:51.439 
sounds and everything else and it sounds
like<00:05:50.700> I'm<00:05:50.909> recording<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.330> a

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
like I'm recording in a

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.080 
like I'm recording in a
buthe<00:05:51.629> as<00:05:51.930> opposed<00:05:52.259> to<00:05:52.379> recording<00:05:53.009> in<00:05:53.219> my<00:05:53.639> room

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
buthe as opposed to recording in my room

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.119 
buthe as opposed to recording in my room
a<00:05:54.330> few<00:05:54.900> feet<00:05:55.050> away<00:05:55.169> from<00:05:55.289> my<00:05:55.559> hard<00:05:55.770> drives<00:05:55.979> and

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
a few feet away from my hard drives and

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.549 
a few feet away from my hard drives and
computers<00:05:56.520> so<00:05:57.210> that's<00:05:57.419> um<00:05:57.689> that's<00:05:57.960> one<00:05:58.409> of<00:05:58.499> the

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
computers so that's um that's one of the

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.019 
computers so that's um that's one of the
most<00:05:58.740> practical<00:05:58.919> uses<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.580> gating<00:05:59.909> and

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
most practical uses of gating and

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.939 
most practical uses of gating and
expanding<00:06:00.569> that<00:06:00.689> I<00:06:00.809> use<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.229> use<00:06:01.680> on<00:06:01.919> a

expanding that I use I use on a

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
places you can use that that makes sense

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.999 
places you can use that that makes sense
as<00:06:05.699> far<00:06:05.999> as<00:06:06.180> in<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.050> musical<00:06:07.469> standpoint<00:06:07.770> when

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
as far as in a musical standpoint when

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.649 
as far as in a musical standpoint when
mixing<00:06:08.309> music<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.759> lot<00:06:08.909> of<00:06:08.939> times<00:06:09.150> gates<00:06:09.389> can<00:06:09.569> be

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
mixing music a lot of times gates can be

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.480 
mixing music a lot of times gates can be
used<00:06:09.900> for<00:06:10.050> drum<00:06:10.289> kits<00:06:10.529> so<00:06:10.830> you<00:06:10.889> can<00:06:11.069> put<00:06:11.219> a<00:06:11.249> gate

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
used for drum kits so you can put a gate

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.510 
used for drum kits so you can put a gate
on<00:06:11.669> your<00:06:12.360> toms<00:06:12.629> so<00:06:13.529> that<00:06:13.740> you<00:06:13.860> only<00:06:14.039> hear<00:06:14.400> the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
on your toms so that you only hear the

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.610 
on your toms so that you only hear the
Tom<00:06:14.699> mics<00:06:15.029> when<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.360> toms<00:06:15.569> are<00:06:15.749> hit<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.169> then

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
Tom mics when the toms are hit and then

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.049 
Tom mics when the toms are hit and then
once<00:06:16.830> they<00:06:16.979> once<00:06:17.339> they're<00:06:17.580> hit<00:06:17.819> and<00:06:17.999> the

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:18.059 
once they once they're hit and the

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:19.939 
once they once they're hit and the
signal<00:06:18.330> dies<00:06:18.479> down<00:06:18.749> it<00:06:19.080> turns<00:06:19.379> that<00:06:19.559> signal

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
signal dies down it turns that signal

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.559 
signal dies down it turns that signal
off<00:06:20.039> again<00:06:20.339> or<00:06:20.490> turns<00:06:20.669> it<00:06:20.819> way<00:06:20.939> down<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:21.449> you're

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
off again or turns it way down so you're

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:22.909 
off again or turns it way down so you're
not<00:06:21.599> hearing<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:21.990> bleed<00:06:22.259> from<00:06:22.529> all<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.800> other

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
not hearing the bleed from all the other

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.950 
not hearing the bleed from all the other
pieces<00:06:23.159> of<00:06:23.279> the<00:06:23.400> kit<00:06:23.639> that<00:06:24.150> can<00:06:24.689> be<00:06:24.779> really

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
pieces of the kit that can be really

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.329 
pieces of the kit that can be really
effective<00:06:25.319> especially<00:06:25.499> if<00:06:25.800> you've<00:06:25.889> got<00:06:26.039> a<00:06:26.069> lot

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:26.339 
effective especially if you've got a lot

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.589 
effective especially if you've got a lot
of<00:06:26.370> bleed<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:26.969> you're<00:06:27.060> trying<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.360> tame

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
of bleed and you're trying to tame

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:28.969 
of bleed and you're trying to tame
things<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.960> little<00:06:28.050> bit<00:06:28.289> so<00:06:28.620> maybe<00:06:28.740> you're

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
things a little bit so maybe you're

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.379 
things a little bit so maybe you're
hearing<00:06:29.219> the<00:06:29.310> cymbals<00:06:29.669> and<00:06:29.759> your<00:06:29.909> Tom<00:06:30.089> mics

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
hearing the cymbals and your Tom mics

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.999 
hearing the cymbals and your Tom mics
and<00:06:30.659> you're<00:06:31.080> hearing<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.409> snare<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:31.740> your

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
and you're hearing the snare and your

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:33.950 
and you're hearing the snare and your
Tom<00:06:32.159> mics<00:06:32.430> if<00:06:32.639> you<00:06:32.819> adjust<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.270> gate<00:06:33.509> on<00:06:33.539> there

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
Tom mics if you adjust a gate on there

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.040 
Tom mics if you adjust a gate on there
then<00:06:34.529> you'll<00:06:34.680> only<00:06:34.860> hear<00:06:35.189> that<00:06:35.370> mic<00:06:35.580> when<00:06:36.539> the

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
then you'll only hear that mic when the

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.989 
then you'll only hear that mic when the
drummer<00:06:37.289> hits<00:06:37.499> the<00:06:37.650> Tom<00:06:37.919> and<00:06:38.159> then<00:06:38.520> when<00:06:38.849> he's

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:38.999 
drummer hits the Tom and then when he's

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.850 
drummer hits the Tom and then when he's
not<00:06:39.150> playing<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.629> Tom<00:06:39.810> it<00:06:40.080> turns<00:06:40.379> that<00:06:40.529> signal

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
not playing the Tom it turns that signal

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.559 
not playing the Tom it turns that signal
down<00:06:41.009> so<00:06:41.189> you're<00:06:41.279> not<00:06:41.339> hearing<00:06:41.729> that<00:06:41.849> along

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
down so you're not hearing that along

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.700 
down so you're not hearing that along
with<00:06:42.599> all<00:06:42.960> the<00:06:43.080> other<00:06:43.229> mics<00:06:43.439> that<00:06:43.589> you're

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
with all the other mics that you're

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.649 
with all the other mics that you're
listening<00:06:43.830> to<00:06:44.129> so<00:06:44.729> hopefully<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.270> helps<00:06:45.539> I

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
listening to so hopefully that helps I

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.969 
listening to so hopefully that helps I
thought<00:06:45.839> using<00:06:46.169> it<00:06:46.259> on<00:06:46.349> a<00:06:46.379> vocal<00:06:46.830> a

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
thought using it on a vocal a

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.980 
thought using it on a vocal a
spoken-word<00:06:47.759> thing<00:06:48.120> would<00:06:48.210> be<00:06:48.300> the<00:06:48.389> best<00:06:48.810> way

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
spoken-word thing would be the best way

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.499 
spoken-word thing would be the best way
to<00:06:49.550> explain<00:06:50.550> that<00:06:50.669> and<00:06:50.969> show<00:06:51.149> you<00:06:51.210> how<00:06:51.449> that

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
to explain that and show you how that

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.510 
to explain that and show you how that
works<00:06:51.870> but<00:06:52.589> next<00:06:52.860> time<00:06:52.949> you're<00:06:53.159> having<00:06:53.279> issues

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520
