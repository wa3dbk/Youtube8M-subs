00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.020
 you see her the HTC Snap and rugged elegiac in the fourth quarter of 2010 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.320
 has appeared special on this device is the operating system Windows 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 Phone 7 installed by the software manufacturer Microsoft 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.610
 that's what we've all been waiting for 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.730
 or maybe not you just do not know that maybe Windows 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 Phone 7 is a bit too late after a trip 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.920
 what exactly the operating system has to offer and he look us in the two 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.849
 Take a closer look at the videos 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.989
 what we know is still 21 since Tober is now Windows Phone 7 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.090
 available 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 First of all, the HTC 7 Trophy of each HTC 7 Trophy looks closer to that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 the sister model of the HTC 7 Mozart that's the packaging here we see it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.730
 device 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 and this typical all of these brings in the tiles 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.610
 Women are from Windows Phone 7 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.600
 so on the right we see windows phone the sign here the name 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.690
 and on the back can be found while datasheet to the device 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.480
 In the one of the packaging that is this typical HTC packaging 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.640
 Pulling out narrower Weichert on Demand 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 and then look like the device 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.120
 now send 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.960
 that's how it looks 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.330
 It looks very good in the hand, it also very well processed 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.580
 that looks elegant too so now the first one is really good 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 a nice device from the outside this display looks nice 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.980
 we have processed this percent of matte plastic 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.450
 completely else but 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.200
 it is really a percent great device now, first of all purely external 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.070
 seen 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.280
 around what more do we have of these dimensions like Arne Round 19 mm May 62 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.119
 millimeter 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.690
 and 12 millimeters at the thickest point 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.850
 So the device is not very thick 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.230
 at 10 o'clock it will be flat 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.420
 yes and it feels as said very very good yes what else he got from 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.409
 outside like here the close to switch around 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.560
 then we have a side by side 5-millimeter jack for headphones 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 the left side find here a volume rocker 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.379
 then we have here the Migrol SB entrance 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.590
 on the right side find nothing but read fast start button for the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.889
 camera 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.599
 and nothing in the meadow 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.459
 he would give me that percent display or the touch screen and then he did 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.389
 has traveled punishment 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.399
 On the back you will find a 5-megapixel camera and a LG flash 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 who stands toes here Windows Phone 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.039
 yes so much from the outside first look what is included 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.059
 Contributed to all the departments of packaging 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:50.969
 that always has a CD it is just a lot of mini for the call put on it 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.569
 then we like quotations and percent FCN 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.239
 we have a data cable here 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.859
 and indeed here we have Rest Stream IQ SB for data transfer the whole 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.959
 but works together with this adapter as a charger for the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.349
 socket 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.489
 one sends here once 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.109
 and Nicholas b connection he got into the device 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.879
 so it looks like that at night is also in the headphones 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.499
 we do not have the packaging 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.789
 that's what winners look like 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:40.219
 then we have a 3 5-millimeter jack here 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.819
 and around 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 Here's a button for 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:49.379
 have to take a break Liebstedt is twelve percent 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.039
 Percent call to answer and the volume you can always rules 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.930
 In addition, Ament has now thousands of homes 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:02.059
 used but I take the acute percent had submitted 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.069
 There are also cargo planes already integrated internal storage 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.419
 and this unfortunately not expandable so it does not look so nice when you are 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.540
 Device the EBIT would like to use player 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.969
 of more than 8 4 two musicians 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.409
 then you can not completely load these on the device 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.080
 so deer and the sim card inserted as you can see 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.710
 that again it hits the thieving percent and HTC money the same time in 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.059
 Life of some htc devices looks like this 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.379
 yes that's the battery call as I said he sits on it 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.379
 and then you put lid on it here in HQ 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.100
 Together with battery, the device weighs 140 grams so it has 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.840
 in the whole crew of weight it is not very easy but not very heavy 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 as I said that they are good in the hand 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.190
 Fits well in your trouser pocket is really a nice device now 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.539
 externally first 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.599
 and without a contract you can get the device for 480 euros and that only 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.439
 in black
