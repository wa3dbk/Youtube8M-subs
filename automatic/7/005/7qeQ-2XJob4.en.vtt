00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
well it's challenging because the being

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
well it's challenging because the being
a<00:01:09.240> lack<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> infrastructure<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> lack<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
a lack of infrastructure and lack of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
access to watching the games for example

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
access to watching the games for example
like<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> NHL<00:01:14.159> does<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.729> any<00:01:14.850> broadcast

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
like the NHL does not have any broadcast

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.440 
like the NHL does not have any broadcast
rights<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.020> India<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.820> people<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.270> get

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
rights in India and so people don't get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
rights in India and so people don't get
a<00:01:18.509> chance<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.900> watch<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.140> sport<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
a chance to watch the sport and then if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.580 
a chance to watch the sport and then if
