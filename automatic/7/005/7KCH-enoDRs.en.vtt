way<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> fish<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> shallow<00:02:13.470> cover<00:02:13.860> up

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
way to fish that the shallow cover up

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.770 
way to fish that the shallow cover up
here<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.430> definitely<00:02:14.640> pitching<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.360> flipping

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
here is definitely pitching and flipping

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.630 
here is definitely pitching and flipping
I<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.620> looking<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> matted

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I really like looking for the matted

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.670 
I really like looking for the matted
stuff<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.120> seems<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.600> hold<00:02:19.050> fish<00:02:19.350> really

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
stuff it seems to hold fish really

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.070 
stuff it seems to hold fish really
consistently<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> even<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.660> standing

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
consistently but to even the standing

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080 
consistently but to even the standing
rice<00:02:22.320> or<00:02:22.620> standing<00:02:23.040> pencil<00:02:23.400> Reed's<00:02:23.580> are<00:02:23.850> there

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
rice or standing pencil Reed's are there

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
rice or standing pencil Reed's are there
great<00:02:24.330> ways<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.570> catch<00:02:24.870> them<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.140> here<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.530> like

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
great ways to catch them up here I like

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.259 
great ways to catch them up here I like
throwing<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> three-quarter<00:02:26.820> ounce<00:02:26.850> weigh

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
throwing the three-quarter ounce weigh

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.699 
throwing the three-quarter ounce weigh
it<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.930> get<00:02:28.080> through<00:02:28.260> pretty<00:02:28.500> much

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it it can get through pretty much

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
it it can get through pretty much
anything<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> doesn't<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.940> fast<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
anything and it doesn't have to fast of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.570 
anything and it doesn't have to fast of
a<00:02:30.600> fall<00:02:30.840> speed<00:02:31.140> where<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:31.920> find<00:02:32.310> some

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
a fall speed where if I I find some

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.340 
a fall speed where if I I find some
sparse<00:02:32.850> cover<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.480> still<00:02:33.690> flip<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.140> in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
sparse cover I can still flip this in

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.560 
sparse cover I can still flip this in
there<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.040> confidence<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.790> it's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
there and have confidence that it's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.540 
there and have confidence that it's
going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.780> catch<00:02:36.959> them<00:02:37.170> pulling<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.310> some

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
going to catch them pulling up on some

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160 
going to catch them pulling up on some
of<00:02:38.580> these<00:02:38.760> grass<00:02:39.150> beds<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.840> really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
of these grass beds can be really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.810 
of these grass beds can be really
intimidating<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:41.040> there's<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> ton<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
intimidating because there's a ton of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.000 
intimidating because there's a ton of
water<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> cover<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> approach<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
water here to cover when you approach a

water here to cover when you approach a
grass<00:02:44.250> bed<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.550> first<00:02:44.730> thing<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> do

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
grass bed the first thing I like to do

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.270 
grass bed the first thing I like to do
is<00:02:45.630> start<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.019> an<00:02:46.140> edge<00:02:46.320> as<00:02:46.620> bats<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is start on an edge as bats are going to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.190 
is start on an edge as bats are going to
use<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.519> edges<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.030> ambush<00:02:48.450> points<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
use these edges as ambush points you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
use these edges as ambush points you
know<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> start<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.920> hard<00:02:50.130> outside<00:02:50.340> edge

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.699 
know to start on the hard outside edge
inside<00:02:51.510> edge<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:51.900> there's<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.140> hole<00:02:52.350> right

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
inside edge if there's a hole right

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.680 
inside edge if there's a hole right
there<00:02:52.769> but<00:02:53.190> concentrate<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.910> those<00:02:54.090> edges<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
fish there and work your way in you can

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
fish there and work your way in you can
catch<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> outside<00:02:58.350> fish<00:02:58.590> first<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.100> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
catch the outside fish first and you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160 
catch the outside fish first and you
won't<00:02:59.340> disturb<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.000> inside<00:03:00.150> fish<00:03:00.600> plus

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
won't disturb the inside fish plus

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.390 
won't disturb the inside fish plus
you'll<00:03:01.320> get<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> good<00:03:01.680> idea<00:03:01.950> as<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> what

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
you'll get a good idea as to what

cover and you'll start to figure out a
pattern<00:03:22.380> those<00:03:22.650> fish<00:03:22.860> should<00:03:23.010> be<00:03:23.069> sitting<00:03:23.370> in

areas throughout the whole thought so as

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.440 
areas throughout the whole thought so as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
you can see we're pulling up to the edge

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.120 
you can see we're pulling up to the edge
of<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.750> mat<00:03:28.050> here<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:28.800> kind<00:03:28.950> of

of this mat here and it's kind of

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.700 
of this mat here and it's kind of
tapered<00:03:29.520> out<00:03:29.640> front<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.270> most<00:03:30.960> likely<00:03:31.440> what

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
tapered out front and most likely what

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.750 
tapered out front and most likely what
we're<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.220> here<00:03:32.460> is<00:03:32.580> there's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
we're going to see here is there's

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.730 
we're going to see here is there's
probably<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.270> bottom<00:03:33.690> change<00:03:33.960> along<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.500> hard

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
probably a bottom change along this hard

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.410 
probably a bottom change along this hard
edge<00:03:34.950> coming<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.120> what<00:03:36.330> those

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
edge coming up and that's what those

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.760 
edge coming up and that's what those
baths<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.140> position<00:03:37.560> themselves

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
baths are going to position themselves

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.160 
baths are going to position themselves
on<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.430> know<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.550> nice<00:03:38.790> ambush<00:03:39.300> point<00:03:39.600> where

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
on you know a nice ambush point where

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.360 
on you know a nice ambush point where
they're<00:03:40.320> going<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.650> good<00:03:40.830> opportunity

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
they're going to have a good opportunity

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.130 
they're going to have a good opportunity
to<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:42.000> something<00:03:42.210> to<00:03:42.360> come<00:03:42.510> by<00:03:42.660> they<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.990> eat

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
to get something to come by they can eat

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.480 
to get something to come by they can eat
so<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.860> kind<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.190> what<00:03:44.310> we're<00:03:44.460> looking

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
so this is kind of what we're looking

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.070 
so this is kind of what we're looking
for<00:03:44.910> when<00:03:45.060> we're<00:03:45.180> fishing<00:03:45.450> these<00:03:45.540> heavy<00:03:45.780> mats

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
for when we're fishing these heavy mats

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720 
for when we're fishing these heavy mats
is<00:03:46.290> something<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.710> little<00:03:46.860> bit<00:03:47.010> different<00:03:47.610> as

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
is something a little bit different as

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.940 
is something a little bit different as
the<00:03:48.330> weeds<00:03:48.540> change<00:03:48.990> here<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.500> often

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
the weeds change here what that often

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.410 
the weeds change here what that often
tells<00:03:50.160> us<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.550> there's<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.940> change<00:03:51.210> of

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
tells us is that there's a change of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.940 
tells us is that there's a change of
something<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.140> bottom<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.740> going

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
something in the bottom if it's going

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890 
something in the bottom if it's going
from<00:03:53.070> hard<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.670> soft<00:03:53.700> or<00:03:54.240> soft<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.690> hard

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
from hard to soft or soft to hard

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.930 
from hard to soft or soft to hard
there's<00:03:55.470> different<00:03:55.890> bottom<00:03:56.160> composition<00:03:56.790> all

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
there's different bottom composition all

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.270 
there's different bottom composition all
over<00:03:57.300> under<00:03:57.540> these<00:03:57.720> mats<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.920> fish<00:03:59.160> are

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
over under these mats and the fish are

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.890 
over under these mats and the fish are
going<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.490> sit<00:03:59.700> on<00:03:59.730> those<00:03:59.910> transitions<00:04:00.660> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
going to sit on those transitions and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.330 
going to sit on those transitions and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
surface of the water is a good indicator

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
we got back into an area here where it

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.700 
we got back into an area here where it
looks<00:05:08.529> like<00:05:08.619> the<00:05:09.369> canopy<00:05:10.289> got<00:05:11.289> a<00:05:11.319> little<00:05:11.589> bit

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
looks like the canopy got a little bit

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.649 
looks like the canopy got a little bit
clearer<00:05:12.009> underneath<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.819> right<00:05:12.849> away<00:05:13.150> we<00:05:13.509> got

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
clearer underneath and right away we got

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.989 
clearer underneath and right away we got
bit<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.229> didn't<00:05:14.649> take<00:05:14.830> long<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:15.430> know<00:05:15.849> it's

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
bit it didn't take long you know it's

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.429 
bit it didn't take long you know it's
not<00:05:16.089> quite<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.569> size<00:05:16.749> we're<00:05:16.960> looking<00:05:17.259> for

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439 
not quite the size we're looking for

not quite the size we're looking for
still<00:05:17.649> a<00:05:17.680> nice<00:05:17.949> fish<00:05:18.279> a<00:05:18.309> fun<00:05:18.639> sporty<00:05:19.089> one<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:20.050> I
