that's how much glue you put on it and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.830 
that's how much glue you put on it and
you<00:02:12.280> just<00:02:12.400> wait<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.939> to<00:02:12.969> get<00:02:13.150> khaki<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
tweeze it but I kind of been done like

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.550 
tweeze it but I kind of been done like
this<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.180> prepare<00:02:43.569> i'm<00:02:43.689> going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> put<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.439> my

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this to prepare i'm going to put to my

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.490 
this to prepare i'm going to put to my
eye<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.239> shape<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.599> my<00:02:46.629> lids<00:02:47.109> would<00:02:47.379> be

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
eye and the shape of my lids would be

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.559 
eye and the shape of my lids would be
easier<00:02:47.949> so<00:02:48.639> now<00:02:48.790> i'm<00:02:48.879> just<00:02:48.939> going<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.269> take<00:02:49.510> it

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
easier so now i'm just going to take it

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.459 
easier so now i'm just going to take it
and<00:02:49.959> rest<00:02:50.859> it<00:02:51.129> on<00:02:51.400> my<00:02:52.090> lash<00:02:52.299> line<00:02:52.329> like<00:02:53.199> this

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.469 
and rest it on my lash line like this

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.740 
and rest it on my lash line like this
and<00:02:54.370> then<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.939> pull<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.239> in<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:56.819> then<00:02:57.819> pull

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and then just pull one in and then pull

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.679 
and then just pull one in and then pull
the<00:02:59.199> other<00:02:59.230> end<00:02:59.650> stick<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.909> and<00:03:01.150> it's

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
the other end stick that there and it's

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.080 
the other end stick that there and it's
line<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:05.159> yes<00:03:06.159> this<00:03:06.189> takes<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.879> lot<00:03:07.060> of

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
line and yes this takes a lot of

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.569 
line and yes this takes a lot of
practice<00:03:07.719> to<00:03:07.750> put<00:03:08.169> on<00:03:08.319> lashes<00:03:08.650> because<00:03:09.099> it's

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
practice to put on lashes because it's

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.039 
practice to put on lashes because it's
definitely<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.180> easy<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:13.299> that's<00:03:13.659> how<00:03:13.900> i<00:03:13.930> do

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
definitely not easy but that's how i do

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.499 
definitely not easy but that's how i do
it<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.849> then<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:18.970> would<00:03:19.090> just<00:03:19.180> kind<00:03:19.389> of

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
it and then you would just kind of

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:24.960 
it and then you would just kind of
adjust<00:03:19.989> them<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:22.329> way<00:03:22.509> you<00:03:22.540> need<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.970> yes

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
adjust them the way you need to and yes

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.729 
adjust them the way you need to and yes
i'm<00:03:25.180> very<00:03:25.209> aware<00:03:25.659> that<00:03:25.720> my<00:03:26.019> lash<00:03:26.259> glue<00:03:26.590> is

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
i'm very aware that my lash glue is

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.259 
i'm very aware that my lash glue is
still<00:03:27.009> showing<00:03:27.419> this<00:03:28.419> lash<00:03:28.720> glue<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.879> dries

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
still showing this lash glue it dries

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.929 
still showing this lash glue it dries
clear<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.709> course<00:03:32.949> it's<00:03:33.189> going<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> show<00:03:33.699> up

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
clear so of course it's going to show up

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.429 
clear so of course it's going to show up
right<00:03:34.180> now<00:03:34.419> because<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.739> glue<00:03:36.099> isn't<00:03:36.370> dried

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
right now because the glue isn't dried

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.589 
right now because the glue isn't dried
but<00:03:38.439> you<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.769> always<00:03:38.979> fix<00:03:39.370> glue<00:03:39.970> errors<00:03:40.479> that

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
but you can always fix glue errors that

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.020 
but you can always fix glue errors that
are<00:03:40.659> showing<00:03:40.989> by<00:03:41.409> using<00:03:42.069> some<00:03:42.430> liquid<00:03:42.819> liner

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
are showing by using some liquid liner

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.229 
are showing by using some liquid liner
and<00:03:43.269> just<00:03:43.449> kind<00:03:43.629> of<00:03:43.689> covering<00:03:44.049> up<00:03:44.169> your<00:03:44.199> band

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
and just kind of covering up your band

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.640 
and just kind of covering up your band
which<00:03:46.239> i<00:03:46.479> will<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:49.349> sometimes<00:03:50.349> it's<00:03:50.530> not

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
which i will do sometimes it's not

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:00.569 
which i will do sometimes it's not
always<00:03:50.709> necessary<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:58.120> lets<00:03:58.509> on<00:03:59.340> it's<00:04:00.340> really

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
always necessary so lets on it's really

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.649 
always necessary so lets on it's really
nothing<00:04:00.849> I<00:04:02.099> don't<00:04:03.099> do<00:04:03.250> anything<00:04:04.289> special<00:04:05.289> but

where it man so you would just pretty

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.450 
where it man so you would just pretty
much<00:04:26.900> adjust<00:04:27.500> them<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.920> get<00:04:28.070> them<00:04:28.250> as<00:04:28.400> close

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
much adjust them and get them as close
