00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.369
 what's up, my Youtube people, I bring you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.920
 another new video and this is going to be for 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.279
 show them how they can pass 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.240
 applications that have on your android to 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.670
 this to your microsd card good this one 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.189
 you know when they buy a this one 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.160
 a tablet whether it does not have a disk 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.100
 hard of a lot of capacity because they tell you 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.269
 that he can expand the memory until 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 32 64 16 gb this in this case my tablet 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:48.120
 is 8 GB hard drive is very little and it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 can expand up to 32 with cards d 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.769
 with microsd card in this case I already 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.519
 I have an integrated microsd card this 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:03.140
 we will demonstrate by means of feel 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.140
 manager this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 will send me everything I have 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 inside my tablet and in the part 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.560
 I'm going to give this micro SD not 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.120
 they can show me that because I eat 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 I'm recording and it's connected to the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.910
 computer since you can not see this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.360
 good as we move these applications 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.790
 this 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.490
 to start and so the menu does not get 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.330
 make different I recommend you have the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.450
 version of android 4.0 which is the screen 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.120
 sandwich I think this and what we're going to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.520
 do the following you will go to your menu 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.340
 we are going to adjust 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.049
 and since we are in this settings of your 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.659
 right side you will have all the options 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.799
 and we're going to go to the one that says 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.520
 applications as you can see below 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.020
 drums 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.420
 and it will show us all the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.859
 applications that we have the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.649
 applications that we have downloaded 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.369
 applications that we have that we can 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.179
 have on the sd card and running and 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.879
 all this how it went in applications 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 to the card what you have to do 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.019
 is to select any application this 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 He explained at once not all 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.900
 applications you can pass this I'm going 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 to select for example color splash 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.140
 efe ecs and as you can see it tells you to move 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.600
 to the sd card 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.730
 this if you give this option you click 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.569
 will you pass your application to the sd card 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.580
 and you will be installed in it this I 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.959
 I recommend that if you are going to give 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.140
 you want to do this install apps 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.970
 in your micro sd no longer remove the micro sd 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.980
 because you can have problems that already 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.770
 do not detect the applications you can 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.270
 erase this etcetera is very risky 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.430
 then I recommend that if you already 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.130
 you bought a micro sd only the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.410
 Occupy is for your tablet 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.380
 you pass like this and the applications that you 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.080
 want 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.660
 that is the easiest or best way one of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.060
 the forms that your tablet or the pro gives you 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.210
 or the android operating system for 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.740
 pass applications to your microsd card 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.400
 rectified many applications do not 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.220
 they can pass 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 I'm going to give a click to those zombies and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.230
 as you can see nothing else show move 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.650
 to the tablet this why, because the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.900
 I have on my card microsd I am 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.270
 in micro on the card decides me is 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.920
 marking two applications is me 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.170
 also marking the cause versus 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.810
 aliens the hd this is marking me the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.330
 of samurai 2 is not checking the one of snes 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.850
 several applications are me 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.960
 saying that I already have them in my 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.480
 tablet 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.410
 this but as I mention you some do not know 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.970
 can happen in their vast majority like this and 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.920
 You can also find several 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.830
 programs like to partition your micro 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:03.310
 sd and have a separate one this 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.350
 and have separate either divide if it is for 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.970
 music and divide for applications or 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.650
 for other files that you want to have 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 in your micro sd 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.540
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.540
 next video
