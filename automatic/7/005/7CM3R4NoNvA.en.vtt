00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
transmitter from Hansen Pro systems

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.810 
transmitter from Hansen Pro systems
remember<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> transmitter

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
remember that this is the transmitter

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
remember that this is the transmitter
and<00:00:51.000> receiver<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> could<00:00:52.140> buy<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.410> as

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and receiver so you could buy this as

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
and receiver so you could buy this as
well<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.430> use<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.719> transmit<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
well and use it on to transmit and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
well and use it on to transmit and
receive<00:00:55.469> signal<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.309> any<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.789> products

any pictures you have any other energy

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
any pictures you have any other energy
fixtures<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.059> moving<00:01:00.510> heads<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.649> we're

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
fixtures or moving heads but now we're

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.260 
fixtures or moving heads but now we're
going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> basically<00:01:02.250> show<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> how<00:01:02.940> easy<00:01:03.149> it

going to basically show you how easy it
is<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:04.559> make<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.159> picture<00:01:06.110> Wireless<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> at

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
is to make this picture Wireless and at

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.420 
is to make this picture Wireless and at
the<00:01:07.710> same<00:01:07.860> time

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the same time

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.120 
the same time
send<00:01:08.850> DMX<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.869> fixed<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:11.010> your

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
send DMX for this fixed so you got your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
send DMX for this fixed so you got your
controller<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.330> transmitter<00:01:12.840> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
controller you got your transmitter we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
controller you got your transmitter we
just<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.590> DMX<00:01:14.100> cables<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just got one DMX cables going to the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
just got one DMX cables going to the
picture<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.140> mean<00:01:16.710> into<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> transmitter

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
picture I mean into the transmitter

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
picture I mean into the transmitter
we're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> come<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.310> basically

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.470 

have<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.610> output<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.150> light<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:45.480> into

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
have the output of the light and into

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.810 
have the output of the light and into
this<00:01:46.570> input<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.950> moving<00:01:48.250> head<00:01:50.130> okay<00:01:51.160> so

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
this input of the moving head okay so

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.420 
this input of the moving head okay so
right<00:01:52.000> now<00:01:52.180> as<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.230> tell<00:01:53.440> my<00:01:53.800> picture<00:01:54.340> is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
right now as you can tell my picture is

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.730 
right now as you can tell my picture is
still<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.850> some<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.720> color<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.170> had<00:01:56.590> it

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
still on some the color that I had it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.330 
still on some the color that I had it
set<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.220> now<00:01:57.400> we<00:01:58.000> could<00:01:58.150> physically<00:01:59.340> control

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
set and now we could physically control

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.810 
set and now we could physically control
this<00:02:01.000> fixture<00:02:01.710> wirelessly<00:02:02.710> through<00:02:03.190> this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
this fixture wirelessly through this

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.880 
this fixture wirelessly through this
bomb<00:02:04.180> through<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.690> light<00:02:04.900> so<00:02:05.380> we're<00:02:05.710> going<00:02:05.800> to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
bomb through the light so we're going to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.139 
bomb through the light so we're going to
just<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:07.000> movement<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.580> at<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.790> same<00:02:09.970> time

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
just the movement and at the same time

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.150 
just the movement and at the same time
we<00:02:10.420> want<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:10.899> bring<00:02:11.620> up<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.830> LED<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.370> can

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
we want to just bring up the LED we can

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.850 
we want to just bring up the LED we can
so<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.490> see<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.680> pretty<00:02:17.680> much

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
