 cameraman has requested this 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.840
 position but simply 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.450
 because these speakers make you kneel down 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.260

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.210

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.640
 speakers go now welcome here 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.059
 on the one hand the absolute highlights in 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.829
 lausanne program 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.460
 yes what can I say the super helped with 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.379
 plus of one of the most incredible 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.499
 speaker in relation to his 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.050
 Price is one of the parts here 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.219
 in the store every day a lot 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.129
 eerie a lot of goose bumps 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.350
 prepares and always fascinates her 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.729
 with relatively simple cheap means 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.589
 such an incredibly natural believable one 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.760
 authentic and goosebumps feeling 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.130
 to produce a moderate sound picture is that 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.900
 does not come from about the super e5 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.830
 is certainly not for everyone a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.750
 augenweide 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.790
 Most speakers are very much today 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.290
 slender ones have marked certain 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.060
 colors and shapes of the landscape 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.880
 adjust 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.990
 These are criteria that never have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 it is a goal 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.360
 Manufacturer of the studio area 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.250
 comes from people 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.230
 co-developed by the English bbc 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.210
 where a lot of professionals in professional 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.950
 area with work where it is on 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.750
 arrives authentic music playback 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.320
 of course, authentic play 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.910
 to play and not the speakers 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.890
 how to make furniture look like 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.300
 That's why they just look that way 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.860
 as the speakers actually in the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.450
 seventy years or have looked 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.550
 in most studios actually today 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.110
 also still look 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.850
 the special feature or one of the many 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.380
 special features of the speaker 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 that you do not even try this 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.890
 housing in any way quietly 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.470
 but have spot speakers 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.509
 which are tuned from the housing produces the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.739
 instruments work very consciously 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.970
 very thin-walled housings the whole 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.380
 has consciously resonate altogether 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.090
 controlled resonate naturally 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.610
 not uncontrolled but very 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.180
 but the natural ones are swinging consciously 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.050
 sounded colors and vibration pattern of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.700
 instruments very very authentic 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.320
 can play a huge problem of 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.060
 Most speakers today is simple 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.950
 that the upswing of the instruments 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.180
 a double bass what the wing 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.709
 just in the upswing phase 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.209
 simply completely royalty members 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.900
 also agreed the stop and possible 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.459
 tune sounds 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 but what the most easy at all 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.640
 no longer can this 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.900
 authenticity in the area of ​​what to do 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 instrument when his plan body 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.640
 swinging up and that is here 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 incomparably good for the money 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.750
 other special features are just that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 Membranes the cable one sets the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.739
 that's why they are very self-developed 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.390
 have long researched and have one there 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.320
 possibility found very natural 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.420
 to find membrane material and there what 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.160
 should I say so the enthusiasm for 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.620
 this product knows no bounds this 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.000
 is price independent and that will be 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.830
 many experts also confirm many 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.480
 people these speakers at home on 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.430
 one of the absolute best speakers on the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.640
 world market and that really for 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.170
 affordable money and therefore natural 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.530
 also one of the best selling 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.900
 load speakers together and the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.690
 new half five plus version is the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.239
 followers of the 5 there are some things 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
 the midrange has been changed 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.209
 the housing has been edited 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 the frequency ranges have been revised 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.829
 something has been revised 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 the speaker sounds overall 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.670
 more open even more detail 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.880
 even more plastic in the heights precise 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.520
 what we have here even a two 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.110
 small modifications made around that 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.090
 to get to the point even better 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.410
 and what should I say if she has this 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.120
 optics do not bother us, we also have customers 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.080
 they think that's great, but me 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.640
