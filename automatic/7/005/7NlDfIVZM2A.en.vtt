00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
want to cook for too long because the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.940 
want to cook for too long because the
fish<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> rubbery<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> six

fish can get a little bit rubbery so six

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.120

minutes<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.549> each<00:01:47.729> side<00:01:47.759> should<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.479> plenty

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.609 

I've<00:01:56.130> cooked<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> side<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.619> six

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I've cooked the side for about six

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.810 
I've cooked the side for about six
minutes<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.640> ahead<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
minutes now I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.929 
minutes now I'm going to go ahead and
gently<00:02:00.270> turn<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.950> its<00:02:02.189> other<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:02.729> that's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gently turn it to its other side that's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.330 
gently turn it to its other side that's
kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> tricky<00:02:03.719> because<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.710> soft<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
kind of tricky because it's so soft that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
kind of tricky because it's so soft that
it<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> break<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.119> pieces<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it can break into pieces so you just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
it can break into pieces so you just
want<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.320> sure<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.710> you're<00:02:07.920> taking

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
want to make sure that you're taking

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.940 
want to make sure that you're taking
your<00:02:09.030> time<00:02:11.989> okay<00:02:12.989> now<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.410> ahead<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.770> let<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
your time okay now go ahead and let it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.040 
your time okay now go ahead and let it
sit<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.370> another<00:02:14.970> six<00:02:15.690> minutes<00:02:20.870> okay<00:02:21.870> and
