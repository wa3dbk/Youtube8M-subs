meant as a stylized destination layer

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.260 
meant as a stylized destination layer
and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
and I like that they actually did that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.340 
and I like that they actually did that
where<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:15.420> other<00:01:15.509> manufacturers<00:01:16.110> might<00:01:16.259> see

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
where some other manufacturers might see

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.210 
where some other manufacturers might see
this<00:01:16.439> jacket<00:01:16.590> they'll<00:01:16.890> give<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
this jacket they'll give you that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
this jacket they'll give you that
windbreaker<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.759> overly<00:01:18.090> styled<00:01:18.390> that's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
windbreaker that's overly styled that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.969 
windbreaker that's overly styled that's
great<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.560> gotten<00:01:19.830> close

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
great but that would have gotten close

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
great but that would have gotten close
to<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> $400<00:01:20.700> mark<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.450> did<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
to the $400 mark and I think they did it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390 
to the $400 mark and I think they did it
on<00:01:21.900> purpose<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.409> keep<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> close<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> 3s

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
on purpose to keep it close to the 3s

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880 
on purpose to keep it close to the 3s
and<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.659> nice<00:01:24.780> touch<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and that's a nice touch it's going to be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
and that's a nice touch it's going to be
much<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.340> attainable<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.570> at

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
much more attainable now if we look at

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.730 
much more attainable now if we look at
some<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.900> other<00:01:28.020> basics<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.500> remember

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
some of the other basics here remember
