through the z2 mixer as your sound card

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
through the z2 mixer as your sound card
your<00:01:38.850> output<00:01:39.270> routing<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:40.050> gonna<00:01:40.410> be<00:01:40.590> monitor

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
right up and not connected on the z2

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.810 
right up and not connected on the z2
mixer<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:48.540> went<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:52.640> think<00:01:53.640> that's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
mixer and went out of I think that's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:12.340 
mixer and went out of I think that's
output<00:01:56.060> into<00:02:02.660> into<00:02:07.820> scarlet<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:09.000> went<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.660> i2

so I can monitor the sound cuz on

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.810 
so I can monitor the sound cuz on
machine<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> set<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:25.670> see<00:02:26.670> it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
machine I have it set up as see it's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.920 
machine I have it set up as see it's
playing<00:02:27.060> through<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.630> i2<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.630> had<00:02:30.810> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
playing through the to i2 and I had that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.310 
playing through the to i2 and I had that
outputted<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:32.070> channel<00:02:32.400> 1<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.640> 2<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:36.600> so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
outputted to channel 1 and 2 on that so

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300 
outputted to channel 1 and 2 on that so
the<00:02:37.440> output<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.780> my<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.170> i2<00:02:40.560> is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the output on the back of my to i2 is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.740 
the output on the back of my to i2 is
going<00:02:42.260> into<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.650> auxiliary<00:02:45.380> back<00:02:46.380> here<00:02:47.750> right

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
going into the auxiliary back here right

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.680 
going into the auxiliary back here right
here<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> back<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:51.980> gone<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
here so the back of this is gone to the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.470 
here so the back of this is gone to the
back<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.230> into<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> input<00:02:56.270> your<00:02:57.270> mic

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
back of this into the input your mic

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.750 
back of this into the input your mic
control<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.190> routed<00:02:59.610> to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
control and then I have that routed to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.949 
control and then I have that routed to
deck<00:02:59.970> see

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.770 
starts in here but when I turn it down
it<00:04:03.620> cuts<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:04.189> channel<00:04:04.669> out<00:04:04.879> so<00:04:05.269> I'm<00:04:05.389> not<00:04:05.419> rear

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it cuts that channel out so I'm not rear

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.990 
it cuts that channel out so I'm not rear

sec<00:04:23.470> yeah<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:24.770> scratchings<00:04:25.250> going<00:04:25.460> in<00:04:25.580> here

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
sec yeah so scratchings going in here

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:33.279 
sec yeah so scratchings going in here
let's<00:04:26.389> see<00:04:26.539> as<00:04:26.659> its<00:04:26.870> plan<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:32.780> know<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:33.110> can

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
let's see as its plan you know I can

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.770 
let's see as its plan you know I can
record<00:04:33.590> just<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.070> scratches<00:04:36.009> over<00:04:37.009> the<00:04:37.220> beat

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
record just the scratches over the beat

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.110 
record just the scratches over the beat
and<00:04:38.780> then<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.110> can<00:04:39.289> sample<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.919> into<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:41.030> know

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
and then I can sample that into you know

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.659 
and then I can sample that into you know
edit<00:04:41.509> it<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.830> know<00:04:42.889> if<00:04:42.949> I<00:04:43.070> was<00:04:43.220> just<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.490> hit

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
edit it you know if I was just a hit

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:55.180 
edit it you know if I was just a hit
start<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.570> know<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.870> got

start so you know I got
well<00:04:56.190> I'm<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.550> me<00:04:57.380> normalize<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.919> see

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
well I'm on me normalize that see

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.550 
well I'm on me normalize that see
here<00:05:01.520> there<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:05.840> so<00:05:06.840> now<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:06.990> can<00:05:07.199> chop<00:05:07.380> that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
here there it so now I can chop that

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.129 
here there it so now I can chop that
 up<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.280> put<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:08.819> on<00:05:08.880> pads<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.690> out<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:10.020> it

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
 up and put it on pads and out of it

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.279 
 up and put it on pads and out of it
and<00:05:10.169> edit<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:10.919> in<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.130> machine<00:05:11.580> or<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.930> could

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
and edit it in the machine or I could

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.350 
and edit it in the machine or I could
output<00:05:13.800> output<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.550> into<00:05:14.819> logic<00:05:15.210> or

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
output output this into logic or

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.059 
output output this into logic or
something<00:05:15.599> like<00:05:15.660> that<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:19.050> oh<00:05:19.380> yeah<00:05:19.740> with<00:05:19.979> the

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
fader movements in the machine so you

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.980 
fader movements in the machine so you
have<00:05:42.120> your<00:05:42.509> cross<00:05:42.720> fader<00:05:43.699> movements<00:05:44.990> and

you're scratching being sampled into

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:57.350 
you're scratching being sampled into
machine<00:05:52.340> yeah<00:05:53.389> without<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.630> beat<00:05:56.360> coming
