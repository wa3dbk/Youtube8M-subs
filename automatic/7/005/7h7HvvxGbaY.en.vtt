point I've sent it what time it is so i
can<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.250> disconnect<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:53.850> computer<00:01:54.329> because

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
can just disconnect my computer because

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
can just disconnect my computer because
because<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> launchpad<00:01:58.140> keeps<00:01:58.439> track<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
because I the launchpad keeps track of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
because I the launchpad keeps track of
time<00:01:59.219> itself<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.880> by<00:02:00.180> using<00:02:00.390> its<00:02:00.659> timers

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
time itself it's by using its timers

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
time itself it's by using its timers
which<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.560> driven<00:02:02.369> by<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.149> watch

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
which are driven by the the watch

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.429 
which are driven by the the watch
crystal<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:05.180> so

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
crystal you can see right there so

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.460 
crystal you can see right there so
that's<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.710> main<00:02:07.890> unit<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:08.879> um

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
that's the main unit as you can see um

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.600 
that's the main unit as you can see um
and<00:02:10.640> then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and then

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.380 
and then
the<00:02:13.120> other<00:02:13.240> part<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.100> arm<00:02:15.120> device<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the other part of the arm device the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.600 
the other part of the arm device the
system<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.200> remote<00:02:17.470> unit<00:02:17.800> which<00:02:18.460> is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
system is the remote unit which is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.670 
system is the remote unit which is
sitting<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:18.940> next<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.570> they're<00:02:20.530> not

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
sitting right next to it they're not

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.240 
sitting right next to it they're not
connected<00:02:20.980> with<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.550> wire<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:23.380> wireless<00:02:23.710> but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
connected with a wire it's wireless but

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.700 
connected with a wire it's wireless but
I<00:02:24.750> guess<00:02:25.750> because<00:02:26.230> they're<00:02:26.380> next<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.680> each

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
I guess because they're next to each

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.350 
I guess because they're next to each
other<00:02:26.860> kind<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.250> spoils<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> purpose<00:02:28.090> of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
other kind of spoils the purpose of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.130 
other kind of spoils the purpose of
wireless<00:02:29.260> communication<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> yeah

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
wireless communication but so yeah

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.780 
wireless communication but so yeah
that's<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.040> also<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> bluetooth

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that's all that's also a bluetooth

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's all that's also a bluetooth
module<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> bluetooth<00:02:34.750> module<00:02:34.870> of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
module that's the bluetooth module of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.230 
module that's the bluetooth module of
the<00:02:35.260> remote<00:02:35.620> unit<00:02:35.950> which<00:02:36.460> which<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.090> guy

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the remote unit which which is this guy

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.860 
the remote unit which which is this guy
called<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.690> guy<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.960> remote<00:02:38.380> unit<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.420> i'll

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
called this guy to remote unit so i'll

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.570 
called this guy to remote unit so i'll
go<00:02:41.140> ahead<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.410> power<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.490> you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
go ahead and power this up so that you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.640 
go ahead and power this up so that you
can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:42.970> how<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.480> transmits<00:02:43.900> temperature<00:02:44.350> to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
can see how it transmits temperature to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.440 
can see how it transmits temperature to
the<00:02:44.770> main<00:02:44.980> unit<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> 9-volt

the main unit I just have a 9-volt

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.060 
the main unit I just have a 9-volt
battery<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:46.930> i'm<00:02:47.230> going<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.410> plug<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.800> it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
battery here i'm going to plug into it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.280 
battery here i'm going to plug into it
it's<00:02:48.459> got<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> voltage<00:02:49.120> regulator<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.870> power<00:02:50.110> up

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it's got a voltage regulator to power up

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.479 
it's got a voltage regulator to power up
the<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.010> launchpad<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.070> i<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:54.459> this

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the the launchpad see if i can do this

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.610 
the the launchpad see if i can do this
with<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:54.910> hand<00:02:54.970> i<00:02:57.000> think<00:02:58.000> i<00:02:58.060> got<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.270> yep<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:59.380> it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
with one hand i think i got it yep is it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.330 
with one hand i think i got it yep is it
slide<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.910> lighting<00:03:01.300> up<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.310> go

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
slide it's lighting up and there you go

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.580 
slide it's lighting up and there you go
the<00:03:03.790> red<00:03:03.970> means<00:03:04.209> when<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.810> red<00:03:04.930> goes<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.380> it

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the red means when the red goes on it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770 
the red means when the red goes on it
goes<00:03:06.010> off<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.400> means<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:06.760> sending<00:03:07.239> data<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
goes off it means it's sending data and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.900 
goes off it means it's sending data and
I'm<00:03:08.380> coming<00:03:08.650> back<00:03:08.770> over<00:03:09.130> here<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.760> can

this<00:03:44.350> as<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.530> demo<00:03:44.799> project<00:03:45.340> i<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.610> put<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.019> try

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
this as a demo project i just put in try

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.110 
this as a demo project i just put in try
to<00:03:47.080> squeeze<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.590> pretty<00:03:48.580> much<00:03:48.610> everything<00:03:48.910> I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
to squeeze in pretty much everything I

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.670 
to squeeze in pretty much everything I
knew<00:03:49.239> about<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.600> launch<00:03:49.780> pad<00:03:49.989> into<00:03:50.170> just<00:03:50.470> one

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
knew about the launch pad into just one

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.190 
knew about the launch pad into just one
project<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.430> might<00:03:52.090> be<00:03:52.269> useless<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
project so might be useless and

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.430 
project so might be useless and
purposeless<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.340> know<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:56.019> pressing

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
purposeless but you know so pressing

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.449 
purposeless but you know so pressing
this<00:03:56.620> button<00:03:56.680> aval<00:03:57.630> um<00:03:58.650> there<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.769> go<00:03:59.890> now

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
this button aval um there you go now

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.759 
this button aval um there you go now
it's<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.030> voltmeter<00:04:01.390> mode<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.410> actually

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
it's in a voltmeter mode so actually

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.960 
it's in a voltmeter mode so actually
this<00:04:05.769> guy<00:04:06.010> right<00:04:06.130> here<00:04:06.190> they're<00:04:06.580> supposed<00:04:06.880> to

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
this guy right here they're supposed to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.630 
this guy right here they're supposed to
be<00:04:07.150> there's<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.110> alligator<00:04:08.500> clip<00:04:08.890> I'm<00:04:09.340> sorry

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
be there's the alligator clip I'm sorry

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.300 
be there's the alligator clip I'm sorry
I<00:04:09.700> should<00:04:09.850> have<00:04:09.880> set<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.239> up<00:04:10.420> earlier<00:04:11.310> there

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
I should have set this up earlier there

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.819 
I should have set this up earlier there
it<00:04:12.400> goes<00:04:13.380> alright<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.940> then<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
it goes alright and then this is the

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.140 
it goes alright and then this is the
ground<00:04:18.190> probe

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.249 

there<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.499> ok<00:04:24.499> so<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:26.150> voltmeter<00:04:26.569> now<00:04:26.960> can

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
there it is ok so this voltmeter now can

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.320 
there it is ok so this voltmeter now can
measure<00:04:27.439> up<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.680> nine<00:04:27.979> point<00:04:28.249> 12<00:04:28.580> volts<00:04:28.879> on<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
measure up to nine point 12 volts on the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.850 
measure up to nine point 12 volts on the
of<00:04:29.419> course<00:04:29.449> nine-point<00:04:30.110> Foles<00:04:30.319> doesn't

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
of course nine-point Foles doesn't

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.360 
of course nine-point Foles doesn't
directly<00:04:31.189> go<00:04:31.430> into<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:32.029> launch<00:04:32.210> pad<00:04:33.370> through

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
directly go into the launch pad through

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.369 
directly go into the launch pad through
the<00:04:34.550> trim<00:04:34.969> pots<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.419> voltage<00:04:35.719> dividers<00:04:36.199> the

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
the trim pots the voltage dividers the

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.459 
the trim pots the voltage dividers the
voltage<00:04:36.680> gets<00:04:36.860> divided<00:04:37.279> obviously<00:04:37.999> and<00:04:38.469> so

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
voltage gets divided obviously and so

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.159 
voltage gets divided obviously and so
the<00:04:39.620> launch<00:04:39.800> pad<00:04:40.009> really<00:04:40.340> calculates<00:04:40.909> the<00:04:41.779> the

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
the launch pad really calculates the the

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.899 
the launch pad really calculates the the
voltage<00:04:42.590> on<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.370> it's<00:04:43.520> supposed<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:43.819> be

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
voltage on that it's supposed to be

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.269 
voltage on that it's supposed to be
measuring<00:04:44.379> it's<00:04:45.379> pretty<00:04:45.590> accurate<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:48.680> there

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:49.279 
measuring it's pretty accurate so there

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.679 
measuring it's pretty accurate so there
it<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.430> I'll<00:04:49.669> just<00:04:49.849> I'll<00:04:50.060> just<00:04:50.120> show<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:50.479> on

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 
it is I'll just I'll just show you on

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.730 
it is I'll just I'll just show you on
this<00:04:50.810> 3.3<00:04:51.499> volt<00:04:51.710> regulator<00:04:52.719> so<00:04:53.719> we're<00:04:54.500> suppose

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
this 3.3 volt regulator so we're suppose

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.830 
this 3.3 volt regulator so we're suppose
it's<00:04:55.009> going<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.699> be<00:04:55.759> around<00:04:55.849> 3.4<00:04:56.599> because

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
it's going to be around 3.4 because

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.379 
it's going to be around 3.4 because
that's<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.139> voltage<00:04:57.439> it<00:04:57.560> puts<00:04:58.009> out<00:04:58.219> but<00:04:58.610> I'm

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
that's the voltage it puts out but I'm

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.999 
that's the voltage it puts out but I'm
just<00:04:59.539> going<00:04:59.719> to<00:04:59.750> go<00:04:59.840> ahead<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.229> plug<00:05:00.650> this<00:05:00.830> in

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
just going to go ahead and plug this in

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.140 
just going to go ahead and plug this in
there<00:05:01.159> I<00:05:01.189> don't<00:05:01.310> need<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.669> use<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.819> ground

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
there I don't need to use the ground

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.119 
there I don't need to use the ground
Pope<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.539> this<00:05:02.689> case<00:05:02.900> because<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.710> ground<00:05:03.949> of

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
Pope in this case because the ground of

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.409 
Pope in this case because the ground of
the<00:05:04.159> voltage<00:05:04.550> regulators<00:05:04.969> already<00:05:05.240> connected

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
the voltage regulators already connected

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.600 
the voltage regulators already connected
to<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.840> ground<00:05:06.139> of<00:05:06.319> the<00:05:06.469> system<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.099> I'll<00:05:07.580> just

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
to the ground of the system so I'll just

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.439 
to the ground of the system so I'll just
go<00:05:07.969> ahead<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.180> connect<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.169> right<00:05:09.379> here<00:05:09.620> and

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
go ahead and connect it right here and

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.879 
go ahead and connect it right here and
yeah<00:05:11.449> you<00:05:11.509> can<00:05:11.659> see<00:05:11.960> right<00:05:11.990> there<00:05:12.349> that's<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
yeah you can see right there that's the

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.969 
yeah you can see right there that's the
voltage<00:05:13.789> reading<00:05:14.120> we're<00:05:14.750> getting<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:15.139> pretty

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
voltage reading we're getting a pretty

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.369 
voltage reading we're getting a pretty
good<00:05:16.099> voltage<00:05:16.580> reading<00:05:17.060> right<00:05:17.150> there<00:05:17.389> um<00:05:17.659> I

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
good voltage reading right there um I

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.200 
good voltage reading right there um I
can<00:05:19.159> try<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:20.379> try<00:05:21.379> to<00:05:21.439> find<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.219> positive<00:05:22.639> side

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
can try to try to find the positive side

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.170 
can try to try to find the positive side
of<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.509> battery<00:05:23.689> there<00:05:24.469> it<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.279> connected

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
of the battery there it is and connected

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:36.700 
of the battery there it is and connected
here<00:05:27.550> right<00:05:28.550> here<00:05:28.699> yeah<00:05:29.979> so<00:05:34.689> so<00:05:35.689> yeah<00:05:35.870> it's<00:05:36.409> now

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
here right here yeah so so yeah it's now

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.659 
here right here yeah so so yeah it's now
connected<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.639> 9-volt<00:05:37.969> battery<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:39.669> over

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
connected to the 9-volt battery and over

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.990 
connected to the 9-volt battery and over
here<00:05:40.939> you<00:05:41.060> can<00:05:41.240> see<00:05:42.399> the<00:05:43.399> reading<00:05:43.699> of<00:05:43.909> the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
here you can see the reading of the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.290 
here you can see the reading of the
9-volt<00:05:44.479> battery<00:05:44.899> just<00:05:45.770> so<00:05:45.889> it's<00:05:46.009> about<00:05:46.099> 8.6<00:05:46.939> 25
