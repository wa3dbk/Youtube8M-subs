the entire song there is a quick and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
the entire song there is a quick and
easy<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> spice<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.890> drum<00:00:50.219> beat<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.550> and

easy way to spice that drum beat up and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.840 
easy way to spice that drum beat up and
that<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.300> basically<00:00:51.570> only<00:00:52.559> hitting<00:00:53.399> your

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that is basically only hitting your

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
that is basically only hitting your
hi-hat<00:00:54.390> symbol<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:54.960> whatever<00:00:55.260> symbol<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
hi-hat symbol or whatever symbol that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.569 
hi-hat symbol or whatever symbol that
you<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.190> using<00:00:56.570> every<00:00:57.570> second<00:00:58.530> time<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you are using every second time that you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
you are using every second time that you
would<00:00:59.730> regularly<00:01:00.449> hit<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> beat<00:01:01.949> if

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
would regularly hit it so if the beat if

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.039 
would regularly hit it so if the beat if
the<00:01:02.280> original<00:01:02.430> beat<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the original beat was you know on the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
the original beat was you know on the
hi-hat<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.100> instead<00:01:08.490> hit

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
hi-hat was this you would instead hit

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:18.230 
hi-hat was this you would instead hit
the<00:01:08.850> higher<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.210> see

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the higher like this so I think you see

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
the higher like this so I think you see
I'm<00:01:18.479> hitting<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> high<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.170> every<00:01:19.680> second

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I'm hitting the high at every second

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.609 
I'm hitting the high at every second
time<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.060> originally<00:01:21.689> hit<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
time that I would originally hit it now

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
time that I would originally hit it now
if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> add<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> more

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
if you want to add a little bit more

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.200 
if you want to add a little bit more
flair<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.710> basically<00:01:25.920> release<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
flair you can basically release the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.630 
flair you can basically release the
hi-hat<00:01:27.570> pedal<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.409> touch<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> strike

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
hi-hat pedal just to touch and strike

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
hi-hat pedal just to touch and strike
the<00:01:29.850> hi-hat<00:01:30.299> along<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> edge<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> cymbal

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the hi-hat along the edge of the cymbal

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
the hi-hat along the edge of the cymbal
or<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.400> any<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> other<00:01:32.850> symbols<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
or you know any of the other symbols you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
or you know any of the other symbols you
can<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> same<00:01:33.930> thing<00:01:34.200> instead<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> along

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
can do the same thing instead of along

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.730 
can do the same thing instead of along
the<00:01:35.759> inner<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.600> outer<00:01:36.750> circle<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
the inner the outer circle you can

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.710 
the inner the outer circle you can
along<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> edge<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.270> sounds<00:01:40.540> something

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
along the edge so it sounds something

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.520 
along the edge so it sounds something
like<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:45.900> now<00:01:46.900> what<00:01:47.050> I'm<00:01:47.140> gonna<00:01:47.229> do<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.470> I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
like this now what I'm gonna do is I

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.190 
like this now what I'm gonna do is I
show<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:47.979> an<00:01:48.310> example<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.090> me<00:01:49.270> doing<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:49.780> I'm

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
show you an example of me doing this I'm

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200 
show you an example of me doing this I'm
going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.409> take<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.619> regular<00:01:50.950> old<00:01:51.400> drum<00:01:52.000> beat

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
going to take a regular old drum beat

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.109 
going to take a regular old drum beat
and<00:01:52.360> I'm<00:01:52.690> gonna<00:01:52.810> spice<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.259> up<00:01:53.650> by<00:01:54.220> adding<00:01:54.580> in

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
and I'm gonna spice it up by adding in

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.770 
and I'm gonna spice it up by adding in
that<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.960> hi-hat<00:01:57.240> modification<00:01:58.240> that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
that that hi-hat modification that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.109 
that that hi-hat modification that
requires<00:01:59.710> me<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.009> only<00:02:00.100> hit<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.430> every<00:02:00.700> second

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
requires me to only hit it every second

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:01.440 
requires me to only hit it every second
time

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
time

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.270 
time
so<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.869> original<00:02:01.960> drum<00:02:02.560> beat<00:02:02.740> will<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:02.950> played

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
so the original drum beat will be played

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580 
so the original drum beat will be played
and<00:02:03.460> then<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.700> spiced<00:02:04.180> up<00:02:04.450> drum<00:02:04.990> beat<00:02:05.200> all

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and then the spiced up drum beat all

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.090 
and then the spiced up drum beat all
right

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
right

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:30.300 
right
take<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.399> listen<00:02:27.750> did<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.930> alter<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.350> tempo<00:02:30.070> of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
take a listen did not alter the tempo of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250 
take a listen did not alter the tempo of
the<00:02:30.700> beat<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.209> didn't<00:02:31.450> alter<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> beat<00:02:32.050> at

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the beat and it didn't alter the beat at

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.290 
the beat and it didn't alter the beat at
all<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.830> still<00:02:33.040> remain<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.550> same<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.060> just

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
all it still remain the same it just

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.390 
all it still remain the same it just
added<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.050> little<00:02:35.080> bit<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.560> flavor<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
added a little bit of flavor to it and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.550 
added a little bit of flavor to it and
the<00:02:36.819> coolest<00:02:37.180> thing<00:02:37.300> about<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:38.110> little

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the coolest thing about this little

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.100 
the coolest thing about this little
method<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.130> these<00:02:39.610> two<00:02:39.940> beats<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.510> basic

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
method is that these two beats the basic

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.340 
method is that these two beats the basic
beat<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> spiced<00:02:41.950> stuffy<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.120> used

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
beat and the spiced stuffy can be used

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.600 
beat and the spiced stuffy can be used
interchangeably<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.620> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.280> boring

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
interchangeably so if you have a boring

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.130 
interchangeably so if you have a boring
beat<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.180> think<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.570> crowd<00:02:46.780> will<00:02:46.989> get

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
beat that you think the crowd will get

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.410 
beat that you think the crowd will get
bored<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.950> after<00:02:48.850> you've<00:02:48.940> been<00:02:49.060> playing<00:02:49.299> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
bored of after you've been playing it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
bored of after you've been playing it
for<00:02:49.450> two<00:02:49.750> two-and-a-half<00:02:50.110> three<00:02:50.620> minutes

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
for two two-and-a-half three minutes

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.600 
for two two-and-a-half three minutes
then<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:52.360> basically<00:02:52.890> only<00:02:53.890> hit<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
then just basically only hit this the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.090 
then just basically only hit this the
hi-hat<00:02:55.150> every<00:02:55.660> second<00:02:56.440> time<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.950> would

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
hi-hat every second time that you would

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.490 
hi-hat every second time that you would
have<00:02:57.160> originally<00:02:57.790> hit<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.360> strike<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.410> on

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
have originally hit it and strike it on

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.020 
have originally hit it and strike it on
the<00:02:59.560> side<00:02:59.950> if<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.220> want<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.549> really<00:03:00.730> give<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the side if you want to really give it

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.940 
the side if you want to really give it
some<00:03:01.150> flavor<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.900> keep<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.410> rest<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.829> the

some flavor and keep the rest of the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.850 
some flavor and keep the rest of the
beat<00:03:03.329> identical<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.480> how<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:05.110> originally<00:03:05.680> was

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
beat identical to how it originally was
