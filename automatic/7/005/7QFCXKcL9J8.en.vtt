00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello talk cursed 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.019
 feeding it is very exciting all 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.849
 young moms and moms-to-be topics because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.130
 that for mom is very important to her 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 the baby was full and pleased with it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 associate with health with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 performance of maternal duties but 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.580
 and so on and so many moms on this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 topic 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.699
 there are different fears of experiencing suddenly 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.970
 not enough milk is suddenly too 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.309
 many suddenly there will be some 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 inflammatory processes and so on here 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.500
 the most important thing is that women have not yet given birth 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 while she is in position 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 tune in to what milk will 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.950
 as much as is necessary and that's how any 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
 surprisingly this one here is the mood he 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 it helps a lot sometimes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 more help than really 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.430
 some physiological things but 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 some physiological factors 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.870
 there are also me today 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 I'll tell you a little bit 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 the most frequently asked questions ask 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.299
 how to feed the baby sitting up standing there and so 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.960
 further so here I want to say 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.420
 feed by sitting even stand still well 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.810
 although standing on my head I do not know the main thing 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 so that both you and the baby are comfortable here 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 the most important factor is the only one 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 factor that says that everything 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.110
 Going well and very important to the nipple 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 swallowed like a mouth 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.439
 completely not only here is the upper part of as 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.470
 together with the halo there will be no extra 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.390
 injuries and it is very important if all the same 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.939
 minor injuries happened 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 don't panic but just 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.759
 smear something softening somehow 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.020
 moisturizer or butter and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.680
 in general, it will help 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 but it is very important to remember that you can not smear 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.340
 creams are the strongest 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.900
 anti-inflammatory creams which 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.260
 contains contains 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.570
 anal stuff because nipple 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.770
 will heal very quickly but these 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 hormonal substances 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.600
 together with your milk to smooth the baby 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
 so do it in no way 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.220
 it is impossible the simpler and more primitive means 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.120
 like baby cream or olive oil 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.460
 the better it is but make it so that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.280
 child of course this cream is not licking 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.530
 because it will be just that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.590
 unpleasantly still would like to talk about 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.270
 milk crises are such states 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.640
 which can practically remember 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.090
 any mom who once fed 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.490
 your baby when milk becomes 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.560
 less and unfortunately many girls 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.740
 who just recently gave birth to this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.830
 just don't know now i want to warn 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.560
 it's just chris when we drop you 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.560
 the amount of milk does not mean that she 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.880
 everything is about to stop in our lives 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.780
 goes on a sinusoid including milk 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.610
 that is, here first you gave birth to you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.980
 colostrum appeared then appeared 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.680
 it was his milk at first was a little bit 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.280
 then it becomes more and then 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.780
 suddenly the child's needs rose a 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.250
 the amount of milk has not had time so 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.709
 should happen ok and what 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.160
 happens if nothing interferes with 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.489
 this process is the amount of milk 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.830
 pulls up for the child's needs 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.980
 what cases does he pull up yes when 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.260
 you put your chest is not strictly on 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.720
 hours and when the child wanted 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.550
 that is, adapt to your 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.739
 child let the child adapts 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.360
 to you let your breasts and your lactation 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.060
 adapts to your needs 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.120
 baby and then everything will be ok then 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.830
 there is just more often apply and not 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.280
 let's mix this time 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.980
 mix for the baby right away that's when only 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.590
 a little less milk and mommy 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.709
 by his 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 husband so quickly go buy the best 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.970
 mix by the way I remember at our institute 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.310
 even said that the mixture is straight 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 great baby warmed that's all 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.580
 balanced only after steel 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.090
 say something to me this blatantly blinoff 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.169
 which will provide immunity dodavit 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.770
 surely milk is the best 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.630
 remedy for baby you just better not 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.040
 think up 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.710
 man and can compete with nature 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.490
 so here is this mommy who became 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.620
 less milk sends your peasant 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.110
 mixtures what happens you dilute you dare 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.130
 become a child he gorses to sleep 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.860
 what happens to your milk all 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.580
 needs no your psyche calmed down 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.210
 your hormones calmed down milk will 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.970
 less and less and less try 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.610
 still don't do that 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.139
 otherwise you will go very quickly with 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.360
 breastfeeding 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:08.050
 on artificial feeding and this 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.960
 bad and any mixture as i said 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.479
 she will always be worse than breast milk 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.289
 but if mom doesn't catastrophically 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.389
 lack of milk, too, do not consider yourself 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.820
 bad mother there and so on well so 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.500
 happens if you have already explicitly on 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.550
 little milk and long baby not 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.700
 gaining weight 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.520
 we must add the milk mixture has 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:38.560
 one question frequently encountered is how 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:40.419
 baby give him water before 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.310
 it was thought that I would give completely 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.800
 necessary you will understand here everything and in 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.169
 medicine all-all-everything is changing everywhere 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.020
 Now it is believed that water can not 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.550
 give if the child does not have such 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.289
 needs that is if it is ok 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.020
 audience that he does not have constipation it is not 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:03.039
 asks, in principle, there is some kind of milk 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:04.740
 her yes and immediately water liquid part of milk 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.090
 already present 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.759
 and one more interesting question last 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.880
 when it is necessary to introduce supplements and here too 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.360
 extremely often moms ask such such 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.639
 questions 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.289
 there are certain rules that 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.199
 do you know a pediatrician how i see and 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.720
 Of course I can tell you but to 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.910
 this is my relationship a little bit different 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.280
 I think you should look at 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.139
 own baby and not hard there 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.560
 watch what jar when in 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.539
 how many months what day to give namely 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.360
 knowing the norms that you can in any there 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.180
 read the guide to adapt 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.300
 just to your baby and if he 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.690
 gorge on milk just milk you 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.300
 can you feed him and not give not 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:56.220
 Hurry up with this will have time all life 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:58.400
 ahead but if you see that the child is not 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.130
 eats up you can quite easily 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.130
 and give him a banana and an apple will lose it 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.380
 grated curd make 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.900
 do something yourself not necessarily 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.289
 buy it all in banks forgive 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.169
 me 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.770
 baby food manufacturers I consider 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.570
 what for example buckwheat 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.060
 ground and cooked ground 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.500
 banana but much better fresh 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.710
 it will always be better 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.229
 eat 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.620
 moms for enough 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.490
 milk I will tell in another video thanks 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.159
 for your attention 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.580
 look for other videos with you was tatyana
