00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
this is unit 52 skills and this is how

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
this is unit 52 skills and this is how
to<00:00:02.429> make<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:03.030> be<00:00:03.600> able<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> plug<00:00:04.170> into<00:00:04.350> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.130 

not<00:00:53.940> sugar<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.750> I've<00:00:54.870> identified

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
not sugar you see but I've identified

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.759 
not sugar you see but I've identified
the<00:00:55.500> speaker<00:00:56.420> just<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.719> inside<00:01:03.650> on<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the speaker just right inside on the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
the speaker just right inside on the
chipboard<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.810> those<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> two<00:01:07.229> spots

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
chipboard there those are the two spots

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
chipboard there those are the two spots
where<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> audio<00:01:08.899> originally<00:01:09.899> came<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
where the audio originally came out of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.270 
where the audio originally came out of
and<00:01:10.740> still<00:01:11.490> coming<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.830> used<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> go

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and still coming out of and I used to go

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
and still coming out of and I used to go
to<00:01:14.340> those<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.030> spots<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> speaker<00:01:16.440> where

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to those two spots on the speaker where

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
to those two spots on the speaker where
you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> soldering<00:01:18.060> marks<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.740> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you can see the soldering marks are so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
you can see the soldering marks are so
all<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> identify<00:01:20.700> those

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
all you have to do is identify those

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.410 
all you have to do is identify those
spots<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:21.990> speaker<00:01:22.850> unsolder<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
spots on the speaker unsolder them and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
spots on the speaker unsolder them and
then<00:01:24.810> reattach<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.679> quarter<00:01:26.070> inch

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.290 

hilariously<00:01:57.490> don't<00:01:57.910> worry<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:03.190> what<00:02:04.060> did<00:02:04.210> I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
hilariously don't worry so what did I

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.680 
hilariously don't worry so what did I
learn<00:02:04.510> one<00:02:05.230> tire<00:02:06.160> guitars<00:02:06.640> are<00:02:07.000> by<00:02:07.390> far<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
learn one tire guitars are by far the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.620 
learn one tire guitars are by far the
best<00:02:07.990> guitars<00:02:08.590> -<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.550> learned<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.180> even

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
best guitars - I learned that even

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.600 
best guitars - I learned that even
though<00:02:10.750> electricity<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.610> extremely

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
though electricity is extremely

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
though electricity is extremely
complicated<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.140> understand<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.740> basics

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
complicated if you understand the basics

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.560 
complicated if you understand the basics
of<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.790> open<00:02:16.090> up<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.300> ton<00:02:16.540> of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
of it it can open up a ton of

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.390 
of it it can open up a ton of
possibilities<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.160> hadn't

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
possibilities for you if I hadn't

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.910 
possibilities for you if I hadn't
learned<00:02:18.610> about<00:02:18.880> circuits<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.840> audio<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.860> all

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
learned about circuits and audio and all

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.680 
learned about circuits and audio and all
that<00:02:21.100> different<00:02:21.460> stuff<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.940> really<00:02:22.300> basic

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that different stuff on a really basic

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.290 
that different stuff on a really basic
level<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.290> would<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.040> never<00:02:24.250> even<00:02:24.370> thought<00:02:25.120> of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
level I would have never even thought of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.430 
level I would have never even thought of
this<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> possibility

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
this as a possibility

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.320 
this as a possibility
anyways<00:02:27.010> thanks<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:27.520> taking<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:27.970> time<00:02:28.210> to
