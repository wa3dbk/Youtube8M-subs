00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
basketball has really been in a state of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.650 
basketball has really been in a state of
continual<00:02:41.400> improvement<00:02:41.850> over<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> last<00:02:42.239> 25

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
continual improvement over the last 25

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.220 
continual improvement over the last 25
years<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:44.060> you're<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.239> year<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:45.930> we

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
years or so you're in year out if we

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.900 
years or so you're in year out if we
pushed<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.709> envelope<00:02:46.739> further<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.760> further

pushed the envelope further and further

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.430 
pushed the envelope further and further
I<00:02:48.269> think<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:48.989> one<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> terrific

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I think that's one of the terrific

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680 
I think that's one of the terrific
things<00:02:49.859> about<00:02:50.130> our<00:02:50.760> program<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.450> we're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
things about our program is that we're

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
things about our program is that we're
never<00:02:51.840> satisfied<00:02:52.109> now<00:02:52.980> we're<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.609> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
never satisfied now we're now one of the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.250 
never satisfied now we're now one of the
very<00:02:54.030> elite<00:02:54.329> proof<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.720> schools<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.079> have

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
very elite proof of schools that have

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
very elite proof of schools that have
been<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> multiple<00:02:55.890> e<00:02:56.220> dates<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.640> last

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
been to multiple e dates in the last

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.819 
been to multiple e dates in the last
five<00:02:57.120> years<00:02:57.150> we're<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.079> only<00:02:58.170> private<00:02:58.500> school

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
you talk about Xavier in recruiting it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.690 
you talk about Xavier in recruiting it
starts<00:03:37.300> with<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.480> degree<00:03:37.770> starts<00:03:38.770> with<00:03:38.950> think

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
starts with a degree starts with think

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.180 
starts with a degree starts with think
on<00:03:39.850> our<00:03:39.880> location<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.990> then<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.040> word

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
on our location and then the word

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.360 
on our location and then the word
development<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.720> at<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.020> forefront<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.830> who

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
development is at the forefront of who

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.360 
development is at the forefront of who
we<00:03:45.520> are<00:03:45.550> we<00:03:46.120> have<00:03:46.240> evidence<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:47.050> this<00:03:47.980> place

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
we are we have evidence that this place

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.540 
we are we have evidence that this place
works<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.960> think<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.800> also<00:03:50.830> affects<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
works and I think it also affects the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.280 
works and I think it also affects the
current<00:03:51.880> players<00:03:52.120> because<00:03:52.600> they<00:03:52.780> know<00:03:53.020> that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
current players because they know that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.680 
current players because they know that
while<00:03:53.920> they're<00:03:54.130> here<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:55.420> they<00:03:55.540> are

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
while they're here that they are

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.660 
while they're here that they are
improving<00:03:56.260> they<00:03:56.680> are<00:03:56.830> getting<00:03:57.070> better<00:03:57.430> and

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
improving they are getting better and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.610 
improving they are getting better and
that<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.330> day<00:03:58.510> maybe<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.110> can<00:03:59.290> meet<00:03:59.440> at

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
that one day maybe they can meet at

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.190 
that one day maybe they can meet at
