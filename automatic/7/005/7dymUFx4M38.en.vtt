on<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:58.920> by<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> drake<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.700> bj<00:03:01.660> card<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.109> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
on one by a drake and bj card and the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.400 
on one by a drake and bj card and the
rest<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.470> them<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.810> cool<00:03:04.810> tending<00:03:05.139> to<00:03:05.230> use

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
rest of them it's a cool tending to use

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
rest of them it's a cool tending to use
and<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.100> yeah<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:07.120> there<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.930> go<00:03:07.959> syncopation

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
and so yeah so there we go syncopation

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.840 
and so yeah so there we go syncopation
now<00:03:10.870> as<00:03:11.530> i<00:03:11.680> say<00:03:11.829> you'd<00:03:11.980> have<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.250> go<00:03:12.340> crazy<00:03:12.549> with

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
now as i say you'd have to go crazy with

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.809 
now as i say you'd have to go crazy with
it<00:03:12.900> tiny<00:03:13.900> bit<00:03:14.109> if<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.410> want<00:03:14.620> go<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.310> little<00:03:15.609> bit

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
it tiny bit if you want go a little bit

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.670 
it tiny bit if you want go a little bit
wild<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.799> starting<00:03:18.000> core<00:03:19.000> steps<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:19.690> really

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
wild and starting core steps and really

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.140 
wild and starting core steps and really
fast<00:03:21.220> hi<00:03:21.639> how<00:03:21.819> Sam<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.560> yeah<00:03:23.799> you<00:03:24.430> don't<00:03:24.940> have

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
fast hi how Sam but yeah you don't have

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.610 
fast hi how Sam but yeah you don't have
to<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.560> next<00:03:26.739> step<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.310> velocity<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:29.440> get

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
to now the next step is velocity to get

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.520 
to now the next step is velocity to get
more<00:03:29.799> real<00:03:30.100> feel<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.609> it<00:03:30.840> more<00:03:31.840> natural<00:03:32.019> sound

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
more real feel to it more natural sound

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.610 
more real feel to it more natural sound
set<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:33.280> adjust<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.819> velocity<00:03:34.209> slyly<00:03:34.660> again

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
set just adjust the velocity slyly again

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.949 
set just adjust the velocity slyly again
don't<00:03:35.980> go<00:03:36.069> crazy<00:03:36.340> with<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.639> but<00:03:37.389> just<00:03:37.480> adjusted

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
don't go crazy with it but just adjusted

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:46.650 
don't go crazy with it but just adjusted
slightly<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.920> give<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.310> natural<00:03:39.849> feel

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.850 

see<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> all<00:03:47.930> these<00:03:48.140> little<00:03:48.349> things<00:03:48.440> they

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
see the all these little things they

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.930 
see the all these little things they
don't<00:03:49.040> make<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.220> lot<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.459> difference<00:03:49.819> by

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
don't make a lot of difference by

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.030 
don't make a lot of difference by
themselves<00:03:50.300> but<00:03:50.569> wants<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.870> put<00:03:51.050> together<00:03:51.379> is

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
themselves but wants to put together is

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.580 
themselves but wants to put together is
so<00:03:52.370> much<00:03:52.519> more<00:03:52.550> interesting<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:54.200> listen<00:03:54.290> to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
so much more interesting to listen to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.570 
so much more interesting to listen to
much<00:03:54.890> much<00:03:55.250> more<00:03:56.260> cleaner<00:03:57.260> more<00:03:57.650> authentic

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
much much more cleaner more authentic

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.240 
much much more cleaner more authentic
sound<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.120> you're<00:03:59.900> much<00:04:00.019> more<00:04:00.530> likely<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:01.069> get

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
sound and you're much more likely to get

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.850 
sound and you're much more likely to get
people<00:04:01.550> listening<00:04:01.940> or<00:04:02.290> selling<00:04:03.290> beats<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.739> get

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
people listening or selling beats to get

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.360 
people listening or selling beats to get
a<00:04:03.890> sale<00:04:04.420> thirdly<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.810> planning<00:04:06.319> now<00:04:07.099> this<00:04:07.310> is

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
a sale thirdly is planning now this is

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.890 
a sale thirdly is planning now this is
an<00:04:07.640> underestimates<00:04:08.269> technique<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.780> my

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
an underestimates technique in my

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.729 
an underestimates technique in my
opinion<00:04:09.370> for<00:04:10.370> example<00:04:10.730> i'm<00:04:10.790> going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.030> pawn<00:04:11.239> my

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
opinion for example i'm going to pawn my

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:22.450 
opinion for example i'm going to pawn my
triplets<00:04:12.739> at<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> end<00:04:13.129> right<00:04:14.090> left<00:04:14.330> right<00:04:21.460> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
triplets at the end right left right and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.980 
triplets at the end right left right and
there<00:04:22.610> we<00:04:22.669> go<00:04:22.700> if<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.030> got<00:04:23.120> headphones<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.750> you

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
there we go if you got headphones on you

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.240 
there we go if you got headphones on you
you'll<00:04:24.229> be<00:04:24.320> able<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.560> hear<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.889> all<00:04:24.979> good

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
you'll be able to hear that all good

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.080 
you'll be able to hear that all good
monitors<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:27.080> yeah<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.610> right<00:04:28.790> now<00:04:28.820> we've<00:04:29.060> got

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
monitors so yeah so right now we've got

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.310 
monitors so yeah so right now we've got
syncopation<00:04:30.080> they've<00:04:30.770> got<00:04:30.979> velocity<00:04:31.490> changes

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
syncopation they've got velocity changes

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.350 
syncopation they've got velocity changes
we've<00:04:33.320> got<00:04:33.530> planning<00:04:33.889> on<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.250> last<00:04:34.970> triplets

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
we've got planning on the last triplets

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.670 
we've got planning on the last triplets
again<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.750> cannot<00:04:35.930> planning<00:04:36.290> anywhere<00:04:36.590> you

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
again you cannot planning anywhere you

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.860 
again you cannot planning anywhere you
like<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.700> know<00:04:37.820> how<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.970> say<00:04:38.090> if<00:04:38.780> you

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
like but you know how to say if you

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.300 
like but you know how to say if you
don't<00:04:39.050> go<00:04:39.169> crazy<00:04:39.350> with<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.770> bit<00:04:40.010> of

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
don't go crazy with it a bit of

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.400 
don't go crazy with it a bit of
everything<00:04:40.430> it'll<00:04:41.360> sound<00:04:41.540> beautiful<00:04:41.990> at<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
everything it'll sound beautiful at the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.770 
everything it'll sound beautiful at the
end<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.880> last<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.240> perhaps<00:04:44.389> most<00:04:45.460> or<00:04:46.780> the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
end and the last and perhaps most or the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.600 
end and the last and perhaps most or the
coolest<00:04:48.110> thing<00:04:48.260> here<00:04:48.680> are<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.490> most

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
coolest thing here are the most

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.600 
coolest thing here are the most
effective<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.360> offbeat<00:04:51.220> now<00:04:52.220> we<00:04:52.280> want<00:04:52.550> to

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
effective is the offbeat now we want to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.250 
effective is the offbeat now we want to
do<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:52.940> want<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.240> zoom<00:04:53.419> in<00:04:53.600> hold<00:04:53.870> ctrl<00:04:54.050> and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
do is you want to zoom in hold ctrl and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.890 
do is you want to zoom in hold ctrl and
scroll<00:04:54.590> your<00:04:54.650> mouse<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:55.510> till<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.600> can't<00:04:56.780> go

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
scroll your mouse up till you can't go

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.320 
scroll your mouse up till you can't go
any<00:04:57.050> further<00:04:57.139> I<00:04:58.270> select<00:04:59.270> none<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.500> steps

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
any further I select none and the steps

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.390 
any further I select none and the steps
highlight<00:05:02.330> everything<00:05:02.510> control<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.400> move

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
highlight everything control a and move

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.610 
highlight everything control a and move
them<00:05:04.639> one<00:05:05.300> two<00:05:06.430> usually<00:05:07.430> that's<00:05:07.610> enough<00:05:07.850> and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
them one two usually that's enough and

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.640 
them one two usually that's enough and
if<00:05:09.620> you<00:05:09.710> listen<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.910> gives<00:05:14.000> them<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.780> really

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
if you listen so it gives them a really

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.200 
if you listen so it gives them a really
really<00:05:15.830> nice<00:05:16.130> field<00:05:16.550> this<00:05:16.820> is<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.120> is

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
really nice field this is this is

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:29.740 
really nice field this is this is
without<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:20.120> robotic<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:29.180> hopefully

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
without this so robotic and so hopefully

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.330 
without this so robotic and so hopefully
you<00:05:29.810> can<00:05:29.900> hear<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.139> and<00:05:30.470> believe<00:05:30.860> me<00:05:30.919> this

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
you can hear that and believe me this
