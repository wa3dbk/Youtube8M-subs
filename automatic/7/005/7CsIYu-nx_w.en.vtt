00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 Hobbies 90 we see 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.960
 In two videos, I thought kaka are the ones 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.300
 There you can do much better and rape 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.520
 only four years and up to twelve divide 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.700
 made 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 What do you think of the vbc when you are in general ? 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.439
 Now say if you're an artist 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.119
 the rapping rap now but now 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.500
 not so public 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.270
 has arrived 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 It makes sense to do it 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
 yes then in any case if 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.430
 So if only a few pals say 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.770
 you are really great and your best 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.240
 buddies are then either you are 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 really blatant or tired 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 and is about to grow and so cute 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.709
 to you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.299
 I did not have any friends who told me 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.590
 have you been great I was forced 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.970
 to do with it more or less 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.610
 a hundred citizens from the other mentioned 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.560
 but has foundations for people just like that 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.730
 have stayed close and so on 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.350
 Maybe you've had a break so far 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.690
 maybe video technically good 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.560
 Pace who surrender should 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.150
 join in there 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 can there possibly causing a sensation 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140
 but you have to stop a bit 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 Not only have ideas under the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.560
 Lantern to stand and a little bit too 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.100
 save so you never get far and became 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.410
 then you started with this rap 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.850
 Then you immediately noticed that's the thing 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.350
 which I continue to bock in 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.360
 my future said you are still in 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.900
 the school and there apparently 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.640
 not so not so good but at the raptor 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.319
 works and that's it too 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520
 what we continue to do now 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.140
 So want to throw the school and 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.790
 he knew if you got stuck like that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.660
 now it does not look much better 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.980
 I know and I think I'm running right now 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.740
 and is fun and I have only ideas and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.990
 have synonymous realize video and have 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.880

 ambition with the music school he 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.880

 make a big fight for the struggle 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 but it will become predominantly 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.730
