00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760 

one<00:02:44.160> more<00:02:44.370> core<00:02:44.640> before<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.240> your<00:02:46.230> F<00:02:46.380> chord

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
one more core before it go your F chord

one more core before it go your F chord
if<00:02:46.980> standard<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:48.060> using<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> four<00:02:48.780> note

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
if standard just using the four note

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.770 
if standard just using the four note
Barre<00:02:49.200> chord<00:02:49.470> would<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.100> so

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
Barre chord would be like so

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.020 
Barre chord would be like so
but<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:52.140> string<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> tone<00:02:53.700> down

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
but because string one is the tone down

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870 
but because string one is the tone down
you're<00:02:54.900> gonna<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.500> note<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you're gonna have to take that note and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.650 
you're gonna have to take that note and
put<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.340> actually<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.390> an<00:03:00.540> F

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
put it here so this actually is an F

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.610 
put it here so this actually is an F
chord<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:05.010> dead<00:03:05.190> weight<00:03:05.370> right
