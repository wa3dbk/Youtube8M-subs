00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.500
 leave you see madama keyboard 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 gets stuck but fuck 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 fuck more advice than most 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 simple you never have to be 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 precipitate when played and evaluated 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 every situation well before acting 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.899
 you can't play by chance 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 going to the nose as it happens in Kutno 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.670
 everything must be done with a well rule 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 specifies in mind a goal at least because 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.280
 you can not play so randomly not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 exists go straight re same right 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.519
 right 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 no this left crossbow la 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.500
 my right hand right but where we got 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.780
 rents has said yes ok 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 the excuse arrived but how many times on 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 players all points a rule I would say 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 fundamental to be able to play well a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400
 any fps game know well 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.350
 great game maps because if 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 you don't know it becomes a problem not 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.790
 you know where to go in the sense of playing with it 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 before perhaps with bots and learn all 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.299
 the various routes that are there to arrive 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 the jewels that are used for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.090
 win the dark the most powerful weapons 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.990
 that is essential yes we are now you it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.990
 you know we're a lot 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.530
 no no no don't play now I have to go to you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.500
 you do a double street fighter you are 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.050
 so much a helping hand free kids 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.360
 when you are and play you are focused and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.280
 you are working to win no and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
 obvious that you don't have to be distracted by 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.729
 you don't have anything in the world 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.590
 look away from the screen 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.750
 not even for half a second 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 you have to stay focused then 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 no bullshit in the middle I do n't know people 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 that distract me from strange noises 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.170
 phone other miscellaneous things 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.739
 total silence focused on 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.739
 game and that's it 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:28.850
 madonna how much I pay for this game 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:32.570
 that is from the whores eva is not for me and for 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.180
 me it's not for the bet is not 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.120
 I am playing another rule for me 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.840
 fundamental is that the game must be maintained 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.000
 but some calm don't get caught 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.950
 from anxiety and fear of maybe not 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.560
 you must always have anyway 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.360
 trust yourself to trust in 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.060
 your skill in your level 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.250
 if you thought you could do it 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.380
 then you will probably succeed 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.959
 pull out what our grit 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.640
 the pil of pattaya because so much you 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.230
 our superior to the opponent not 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.329
 let yourself be carried away by the da 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.950
 from incazzatura because it will not serve to 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.890
 other than doing road like I said 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.070
 first then from never getting pissed off during 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.070
 the game 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.070
 in any fps there are more or less weapons 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.250
 to use at least and here the arena is there 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.200
 type from the 8 12 eyes more weapons then 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.830
 these this arsenal you have a 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.090
 your provision should be used by following 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.660
 certain guidelines this means 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.400
 that if I do not know a distant one it will be more 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.720
 appropriate to use a machine gun 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.160
 or a sniper rifle if above 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.320
 your opponent is a few hundred 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.990
 of meters civilly if an opponent rea 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.450
 medium-short distance is worth a rifle 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.940
 these things are a short-range weapon 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.980
 they should be discounted but alas I have 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.870
 seen these rules wrong right here 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.730
 too many others but not used a 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.470
 depending on the situation, guys give it 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.560
 you go you I stay here in 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.990
 defense no no you go in defense me la 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.820
 cable better go you stay here i told you 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.010
 then you go go to the no by I don't attack 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.989
 I'm not going to fan strength to tool strength 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.080
 according to my personal experience 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.730
 during at least team parties 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.770
 you need to have a certain initiative 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.720
 especially if you are a foreman 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.390
 obviously it's not like you can be there 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.580
 scratch away saying maracchi i know i'm going 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.280
 there you go the bohemian I don't know we will do 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.849
 something no you have to have initiative is a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.800
 very clear head plan 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.429
 to be able to do it if you are looking for TV 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.240
 his flag capture or double 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:47.240
 domination you need a look 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.639
 atac has however also that it is in defense no 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.800
 davide you ca n't do at random 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.459
 therefore an initiative that regulates who 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.589
 does what 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:05:02.539
 this leads to success otherwise 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:05:07.639
 it will fail indesign cleverly but what the fuck 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:11.029
 wants the joke doesn't make you laugh but 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.649
 he did so he died but fuck you a 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.110
 big mistake that I saw done by 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.879
 many people and lend too much 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.189
 attention to the game chat there is the 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.769
 People write crap there 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.559
 need to look at them lightly, let alone 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:26.449
 then write them if I were you them 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.459
 jackie via her completely left in 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.019
 written game because they don't look like soccer 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.209
 and who uses it really not done that 

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.939
 feed on the tactics and Italian between them 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:53.209
 it loses time and fiber to become meat 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:56.779
 to inevitably slaughter a rule 

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:58.789
 I would say fundamental of any game but 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.860
 here we also get out of the ambit of the first 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.519
 person shooter but it concerns all 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.189
 gel games and I believe that or not all 

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.990
 to make the most of the audio 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:11.059
 if you can use audio neither 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.369
 a first person shooter as if you need it 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:15.469
 you will be able to better identify the 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:18.399
 opponents where they will be that you love avram 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.749
 because weapons often have sounds 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:23.360
 specific as a crime at the moment not 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.650
 I know for each weapon its sound or 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.259
 he believes he is taking steps 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.570
 the gait of the enemy is made yes more 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.300
 strong felt them means the enemy 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.400
 it is closer to you or just if 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.470
 use headphones to hear better comes 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.630
 net account that if the enemy is standing 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.530
 approaching from the rear right front to 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.870
 left this help not a little 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.759
 account but it is a help that often applies 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.009
 even more than the visual one because 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.169
 he often able to go out 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.300
 intercept your enemy first 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.060
 yet to see it is this one thing 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.150
 rule that if not followed and leads 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.130
 total bankruptcy now I know all of them 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:06.229
 the maps I'm already looking at there was a 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:08.870
 punch a bullshit 6 grotta di madonna 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:11.360
 but since you have been concealing it is unloading it 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.490
 for 20 minutes guys these are 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.350
 only the basic rules however the 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.840
 focus of the speech is that to become 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.110
 really skilled in a game classic 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.009
 or dedication time and desire 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.240
 in short, to succeed is also enough 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:28.130
 in short, intelligence must be known 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.139
 devote to a game for several hours a 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.449
 day because only in this way will you be able to 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.430
 perfect the gameplay place I had 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.490
 stability to always be able to do it 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:40.580
 win always and under all circumstances but 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.710
 requires perseverance training i 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.000
 you have to play games in the squares 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.770
 for several hours a day 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.139
 otherwise the opponents who make the 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.680
 useless bunch and therefore you have to be 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:54.349
 ready to play the game where you have it 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.599
 intention to make way in short 

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:59.180
 so yes follow these tips by 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:01.039
 base you will definitely have a gear in 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.360
 more than your opponent 

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.949
 i'm six mounted like me 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.590
 I also recommend subscribing to mine 

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:08.630
 channel he knew 89 and the gamer and there 

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:20.019
 see you at the next video
