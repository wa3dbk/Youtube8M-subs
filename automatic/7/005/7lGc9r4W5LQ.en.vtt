the<00:05:04.099> reason<00:05:04.550> these<00:05:05.180> two<00:05:05.479> are<00:05:05.660> dark<00:05:05.960> it's

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
the reason these two are dark it's

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.909 
the reason these two are dark it's
because<00:05:06.889> that<00:05:07.039> treated<00:05:07.580> provides<00:05:08.270> shade<00:05:08.570> all

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
because that treated provides shade all

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.460 
because that treated provides shade all
so<00:05:09.919> it's<00:05:10.550> really<00:05:10.849> good

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
so it's really good

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.520 
so it's really good
but<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.820> did<00:05:13.820> provide<00:05:14.000> shade<00:05:14.450> that's<00:05:15.260> kind<00:05:15.500> of

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
but it did provide shade that's kind of

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.770 
but it did provide shade that's kind of
