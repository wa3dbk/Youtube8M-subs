because it's a completely different game
than<00:01:45.930> starcraft<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.159> hard<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> uh

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
than starcraft so it would be hard to uh

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.380

system<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.829> case<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.579> probably<00:01:53.640> would

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
system so in this case it probably would

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
system so in this case it probably would
have<00:01:54.090> been<00:01:54.180> better<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.630> split<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.020> me<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.009> my

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
okay so uh sometimes you can get a bad

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.510 
okay so uh sometimes you can get a bad
layout<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.870> happens<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.500> press<00:02:17.770> Z

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
layout if that happens you can press Z

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.640 
layout if that happens you can press Z
to<00:02:19.270> reset<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.720> board<00:02:19.870> or<00:02:20.050> click<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
to reset the board or click on this

to reset the board or click on this
little<00:02:20.860> icon<00:02:21.040> down<00:02:21.340> here<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.940> don't<00:02:22.120> want<00:02:22.240> to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
little icon down here you don't want to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.670 
little icon down here you don't want to
do<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.540> unless<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.770> absolutely<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
do that unless you absolutely have to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.100 
do that unless you absolutely have to
because<00:02:27.150> while<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> board<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.720> resetting

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
because while the board is resetting

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.000 
because while the board is resetting
your<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.830> are<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.490> wait<00:02:32.010> it's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
your you are going to have to wait it's

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.110 
your you are going to have to wait it's
also<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.250> good<00:02:33.430> idea<00:02:33.520> when<00:02:33.820> you're<00:02:33.940> playing

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
also a good idea when you're playing

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.600 
also a good idea when you're playing
this<00:02:34.270> game<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.290> kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.530> units<00:02:35.950> your

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
this game to see what kind of units your

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.860 
this game to see what kind of units your
opponent<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.060> sending<00:02:37.270> out<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:37.660> send

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
opponent is sending out and then send

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.020 
opponent is sending out and then send
out<00:02:37.990> counter<00:02:38.290> units<00:02:38.560> right<00:02:39.040> here<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> colossus

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
out counter units right here a colossus

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.660 
out counter units right here a colossus
really<00:02:40.810> isn't<00:02:41.080> made<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.290> counter<00:02:41.830> an

groups of marines which we have some

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.670 
groups of marines which we have some
marines<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.450> we've<00:02:49.570> got<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> an

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
marines back here but we've got a an

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.220 
marines back here but we've got a an
ultralisk<00:02:51.160> out<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.490> front<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.940> that's<00:02:52.570> just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
ultralisk out in front and that's just

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.820 
ultralisk out in front and that's just
bad<00:02:53.470> news<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> colossus<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.720> if<00:02:56.470> you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
bad news for the colossus so I if you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.900 
bad news for the colossus so I if you
would<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.040> went<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.280> maybe<00:02:57.550> an<00:02:57.700> air<00:02:57.880> unit

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
would have went with maybe an air unit

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.970 
would have went with maybe an air unit
you<00:02:58.270> could<00:02:58.390> see<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:58.720> make<00:02:58.870> banshees<00:02:59.380> over

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
you could see you can make banshees over

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100 
you could see you can make banshees over
here<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.280> muta<00:03:00.580> lists<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.390> might<00:03:01.720> have<00:03:01.900> been

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
here in muta lists that might have been

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.080 
here in muta lists that might have been
a<00:03:02.350> better<00:03:02.740> choice<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.310> scenario<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
a better choice in that scenario and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.210 
a better choice in that scenario and
maybe<00:03:04.570> make<00:03:04.780> some<00:03:05.080> if<00:03:05.350> he<00:03:05.710> had<00:03:05.830> spawned<00:03:06.070> a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
maybe make some if he had spawned a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.250 
maybe make some if he had spawned a
couple<00:03:06.490> zealots<00:03:06.910> right<00:03:07.210> in<00:03:07.300> front<00:03:07.570> delts

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
couple zealots right in front delts

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.650 
couple zealots right in front delts
don't<00:03:08.470> cost<00:03:08.620> very<00:03:08.800> much<00:03:09.010> only<00:03:09.730> 50<00:03:10.060> energy<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
don't cost very much only 50 energy I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.190 
don't cost very much only 50 energy I
and<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:12.370> sent<00:03:12.790> out<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.120> flying<00:03:13.540> unit<00:03:13.900> he<00:03:14.020> might

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and then sent out a flying unit he might

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.870 
and then sent out a flying unit he might
have<00:03:14.350> fared<00:03:14.650> much<00:03:15.160> much<00:03:15.430> better<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.790> that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
have fared much much better in that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.270 
have fared much much better in that
situation<00:03:16.239> but<00:03:17.080> as<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.380> see<00:03:17.650> me<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.190> my

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
situation but as you can see me and my

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.699 
situation but as you can see me and my
teammate<00:03:18.670> once<00:03:19.300> again<00:03:19.420> those<00:03:19.720> orange<00:03:20.380> ultra

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.150 
lists I think are mine yeah those ultra
lists<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.930> really<00:03:26.440> ripped<00:03:26.620> through<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
lists just really ripped through the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.440 
lists just really ripped through the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.250 
Colossus so yeah very very important to
realize<00:03:53.500> what<00:03:53.800> your<00:03:53.920> counters<00:03:54.310> are<00:03:54.519> here<00:03:55.260> you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
realize what your counters are here you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.590 
realize what your counters are here you
know<00:03:56.550> colossi<00:03:57.550> will<00:03:57.940> counter<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.239> bunch<00:03:58.510> of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
know colossi will counter a bunch of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.729 
know colossi will counter a bunch of
Marines<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:59.230> hydrolyse<00:04:00.360> whereas<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:02.709> know

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
Marines or hydrolyse whereas you know

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.850 
Marines or hydrolyse whereas you know
zealots<00:04:03.580> are<00:04:03.790> good<00:04:04.000> for<00:04:04.290> taking<00:04:05.290> down<00:04:05.410> colossi

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
zealots are good for taking down colossi

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.470 
zealots are good for taking down colossi
because<00:04:06.160> they<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:06.640> under<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.120> range

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
because they get in under that range

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.810 
because they get in under that range
under<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.989> colossi<00:04:08.440> range<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.250> just<00:04:09.700> know

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
under that colossi range so just know

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.130 
under that colossi range so just know
what<00:04:09.970> your<00:04:10.090> count<00:04:10.300> is<00:04:10.390> our<00:04:10.570> know<00:04:10.750> what<00:04:10.870> units

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
what your count is our know what units

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.690 
what your count is our know what units
can<00:04:11.260> attack<00:04:11.530> air<00:04:11.769> obviously<00:04:12.489> if<00:04:12.580> your

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
can attack air obviously if your

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.130 
can attack air obviously if your
opponent<00:04:12.850> has<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.150> bunch<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.510> immortals<00:04:13.959> out

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
opponent has a bunch of immortals out

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.780 
opponent has a bunch of immortals out
you<00:04:14.650> should<00:04:14.830> be<00:04:14.950> making<00:04:15.630> either<00:04:16.630> banshees<00:04:17.440> or

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
you should be making either banshees or

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.180 
you should be making either banshees or
muta<00:04:18.790> lists<00:04:19.060> because<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:20.650> Immortals<00:04:20.979> would

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
muta lists because the Immortals would

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.780 
muta lists because the Immortals would
be<00:04:21.460> unable<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.789> shoot<00:04:22.150> them<00:04:22.300> and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
be unable to shoot them and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.270 
be unable to shoot them and
they<00:04:22.940> would<00:04:23.090> just<00:04:23.120> run<00:04:23.480> right<00:04:23.720> over<00:04:24.280> your

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
they would just run right over your

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.090 
they would just run right over your
enemy<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.420> do<00:04:26.570> spawn<00:04:26.840> Marines<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:27.860> take

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
enemy you do spawn Marines to so take

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.500 
enemy you do spawn Marines to so take
that<00:04:28.130> into<00:04:28.430> account<00:04:28.790> those<00:04:29.270> fun

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
that into account those fun

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.940 
that into account those fun
automatically<00:04:30.020> those<00:04:30.200> don't<00:04:30.410> cost<00:04:30.560> any

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
automatically those don't cost any

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.840 
automatically those don't cost any
energy<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.820> spawn<00:04:32.120> just<00:04:33.080> happens<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:36.130> if<00:04:37.130> your

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
energy to spawn just happens and if your

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.310 
energy to spawn just happens and if your
Marines<00:04:38.150> are<00:04:38.330> getting<00:04:38.540> taken<00:04:38.870> out<00:04:38.960> by<00:04:39.170> your

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
Marines are getting taken out by your

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.290 
Marines are getting taken out by your
opponent<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.490> you're<00:04:40.640> losing<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:41.000> bunch<00:04:41.150> of

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
opponent and you're losing a bunch of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.910 
opponent and you're losing a bunch of
Marines<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> class<00:04:42.200> i<00:04:42.380> or<00:04:42.530> something

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
Marines to like a class i or something

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.980 
Marines to like a class i or something
that<00:04:43.340> will<00:04:43.640> affect<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.420> swing<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.810> game

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
that will affect the swing of the game

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.600 
that will affect the swing of the game
you've<00:04:45.200> also<00:04:45.320> got<00:04:45.560> these<00:04:45.680> cannons<00:04:46.220> here<00:04:46.370> I

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
you've also got these cannons here I

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.150 
you've also got these cannons here I
can't<00:04:47.030> click<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.360> them<00:04:47.540> but<00:04:47.720> they're<00:04:47.930> there

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
can't click on them but they're there

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.070 
can't click on them but they're there
like<00:04:49.160> heavily<00:04:49.910> powered<00:04:50.240> up<00:04:50.360> photon<00:04:50.720> cannons

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
like heavily powered up photon cannons

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.320 
like heavily powered up photon cannons
obviously<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.860> regular<00:04:52.490> proton<00:04:52.850> cannon<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
obviously a regular proton cannon in the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.120 
obviously a regular proton cannon in the
game<00:04:53.510> wouldn't<00:04:53.780> be<00:04:53.870> able<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.110> take<00:04:54.290> that<00:04:54.500> many

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
game wouldn't be able to take that many

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.860 
game wouldn't be able to take that many
hits<00:04:55.370> from<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.640> ultralisk<00:04:56.060> but<00:04:56.570> these<00:04:56.690> are

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
hits from an ultralisk but these are

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.840 
hits from an ultralisk but these are
like<00:04:57.050> highly<00:04:57.770> powered<00:04:58.070> ones<00:04:58.280> something<00:04:58.700> like

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
like highly powered ones something like

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.630 
like highly powered ones something like
the<00:04:59.720> defense's<00:05:00.170> you<00:05:00.260> might<00:05:00.470> see<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:00.890> League<00:05:01.490> of

it I accept your playing Stars you'll to

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.050 
it I accept your playing Stars you'll to
determine<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.690> how<00:05:11.840> many<00:05:11.900> units<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.380> spawn

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
determine like how many units you spawn

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.780 
determine like how many units you spawn
so<00:05:14.080> really<00:05:15.080> what<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.470> want<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.680> be<00:05:15.770> doing<00:05:15.800> is

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
so really what you want to be doing is

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.670 
so really what you want to be doing is
focusing<00:05:17.030> most<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.630> your<00:05:17.750> attention<00:05:18.140> over

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
focusing most of your attention over

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.440 
focusing most of your attention over
here<00:05:18.710> on<00:05:19.010> this<00:05:19.130> part<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.520> board<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:19.970> then

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
here on this part of the board and then

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.180 
here on this part of the board and then
uh<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:22.390> then<00:05:23.390> once<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.440> do<00:05:24.590> get<00:05:24.740> points<00:05:25.040> make

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
uh and then once you do get points make

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.620 
uh and then once you do get points make
sure<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.430> spend<00:05:25.610> them<00:05:25.760> before<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.180> get<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.510> do

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
sure you spend them before you get to do

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.400 
sure you spend them before you get to do
to<00:05:26.990> 1000<00:05:27.740> because<00:05:28.460> if<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:29.570> do<00:05:29.690> get<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:29.930> 1000

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
to 1000 because if you do get to 1000

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.810 
to 1000 because if you do get to 1000
you<00:05:30.500> can't<00:05:30.710> go<00:05:30.800> over<00:05:31.100> that<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.580> you're<00:05:31.730> just

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
you can't go over that so you're just

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.430 
you can't go over that so you're just
wasting<00:05:32.360> energy<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:32.870> make<00:05:33.020> sure<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.230> spend

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
wasting energy so make sure you spend

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.440 
wasting energy so make sure you spend
your<00:05:33.560> points<00:05:33.710> when<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:33.980> cap<00:05:34.190> out<00:05:34.400> at<00:05:34.430> 1000<00:05:35.330> and

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
your points when you cap out at 1000 and

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.880 
your points when you cap out at 1000 and
then<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.960> get<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.110> nice<00:05:36.260> little<00:05:36.440> score<00:05:36.710> screen

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
then you get a nice little score screen

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.860 
then you get a nice little score screen
here<00:05:37.160> at<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.370> end<00:05:37.520> once<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:37.940> win<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.360> that's

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
here at the end once you win and that's
