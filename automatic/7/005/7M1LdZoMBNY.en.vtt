00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello everyone and welcome back his 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 waiting for battlefield line in 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 episode of this today we will go together to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.340
 see what butterfly is a new one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 video game 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170
 or it is a spin off or even 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 we can speak of a very full-bodied dlc 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.800
 but before doing this I just want to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.960
 emphasize that what I'm going to do 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 set out my point of view therefore not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.680
 I claim that you all share 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 what I'm going to say then you are 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 very free those commenting saying 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.890
 what is it for everyone? 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 can see the different way we are all 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 here, in short, that was listening and no 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 in short, criticize no one here if there 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 think differently it is more than legitimate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 and therefore I will respect your point of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.670
 view and I expect you to do 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.780
 likewise with the undersigned here not 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 we lose time and immediately we go to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 maybe talk about spin off beating finance 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 and a spin off 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 well we can certainly say that in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 from a certain point of view speaking 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 of the context it could be because 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.680
 a context no longer comes from its own os 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.329
 war between armies goes a context 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 war in a guerrilla war 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.699
 bata police and criminal then but a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 slightly upset what is normal 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.140
 context from which we are accustomed but this 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.189
 definitely not enough for 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.619
 classify it as a spin off of the series 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 beat this because because when i 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.119
 the interpretation I give at the end 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 spin off and that is kept 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.190
 which may be the context the plot la 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.110
 history 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.490
 panorama that is generated reversal a 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.620
 videogame but is upset that the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.630
 play to explain myself better we take ad 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.150
 example the saga of metal gear 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 take metal gear revenge that is a 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 perfect spin off a spin off that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.790
 therefore it presents the same context 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.470
 historical and other time aspect 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.360
 offered by metal gear but we dress the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.650
 clothes of a secondary character of us 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 a complete gameplay is offered 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.910
 different than what he knows 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.440
 we are used to seeing in Italy in 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.570
 certainly not for me our 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.540
 batt of hard lines is a video game 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.790
 new here so I have a moment 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.980
 example battlefield 3 and beat p4 when 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.810
 passed by bacteria 3 beat the 4 and i 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.340
 simpson and to play a new video game 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.440
 video game than to beat the 3 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.240
 he offered me very different mechanics 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.070
 the first impact was a sensation 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.870
 to play a game is indeed 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.320
 very different than beating the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.000
 time 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.979
 also here the 4 is a video game and it is 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.450
 a whole new video game compared to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.610
 beat the 4 and respect beat 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.410
 abrupt water supply if I logically go by that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.300
 typical style belonging to the saga of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.150
 milk that beats pierre line is a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.250
 new video game respect abounds p4 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.080
 for heaven's sake we can say that we seek to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.020
 keep many of the mechanics ie 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.060
 apologize for charity you shave a little 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.650
 change those of the mechanics and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.020
 game dynamics which normally 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.730
 we are used to it but nevertheless to the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.410
 long playing during this beta ho 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.470
 had the confirmation that after all bat 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.150
 fidart line still preserves a lot of e 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 many aspects in common fought 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.650
 the 4 then the feeling according to me not 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.570
 is to play a new video game 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.980
 it is not enough to change the context 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.880
 it is not enough to change something 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.470
 on the classes e 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.960
 the general dynamics of the video game for 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.120
 to make sure that it beats the batteries and line 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.920
 It moves away so much from the fourth 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.620
 chapter my impression playing and 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.210
 what a full boat online is still a lot 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.130
 very tied to beat 4 then 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.990
 personally I don't see it as a 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.340
 new video game and I can't can't 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.350
 then affirm it because that maybe 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 someone will see it but so for what 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.730
 you are my feeling of playing 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.130
 such a player was not 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.570
 then we can talk about dlc a lot 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.360
 full-bodied is how your hands have you a little 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.740
 forward explaining well I want to do a 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.110
 example let's talk about battlefield bad 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.170
 company 2 with squabbling void ii fu 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.150
 released a dlc called pietro plc 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.710
 which sold at the figure of 20 is one 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 very important figure for the time 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.940
 because the average of the dlc was around 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.120
 between 10 12 euros maximum 15 euros e 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.410
 therefore there was a dlc and even 20 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.240
 euro but that was justified by the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.880
 very important content contents 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.320
 that carried the video game back to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.420
 60 years within the war of 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.370
 vietnam so this ploy with 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.320
 this pretext point after an introduction 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.730
 of the new maps of the new vehicles of the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.430
 new weapons of the new soldiers 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 in short, it was made completely pure 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.730
 the painting around battlefield bad 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.220
 company 2 is a complete context 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.840
 ensuring that different players 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.330
 continued to emerge within 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.950
 bad company 2 finding itself perfectly 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the game mechanics but in a 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.610
 panorama is completely different than i 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.020
 really offered new experiences 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.020
 as the game was always the same 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.580
 This battery is the same off line 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.830
 well somehow yes but some 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.060
 so yes I can't say who it is 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.290
 exactly like pietro attacks 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.570
 content is certainly greater 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.400
 in addition to new maps we will also have 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.490
 of the new ways with the d'este is 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 water so I can say that it beats for 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.630
 backpacks I see it yes with the dlc a lot 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.490
 fuller than you can 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.380
 understand you not simple of us 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.910
 very important column and expansion of 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.250
 what can be beaten 4 that has 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.720
 brought about changes in the aspect of 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.700
 gameplay trying to speed up the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.530
 because game tried to introduce a 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.930
 new context and some new ways 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.000
 along with new maps for me 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.580
 battery flying there is sliced yes 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.169
 as a very full-bodied dlc without prejudice to 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.849
 that anyway 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.740
 introduced some novelties that seek to 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.749
 differentiated video game compared to 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.009
 fourth chapter of bf 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.810
 I have to try I stop the fact is that 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.860
 for this video it goes how much I already had it 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.080
 already said at least 18 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.939
 but no killing 30 times this is it 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.249
 my point of view I must say that I see 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.289
 klein typing with an expansion one 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:13.810
 extension confluite j plus say why 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.879
 call it dlc protests but interprets them 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.219
 he does not see it as an extension of beats 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.939
 p4 which leads me to conclude also the 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.949
 following thing 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.900
 the launch price of this video game 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.340
 and the important thing in my opinion the 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.020
 honest price of launching this 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.449
 video game should be 50 euros 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.349
 in the console version haiti 40 45 euros 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.389
 for the pc version 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.659
 second is this one could be a 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.659
 honest price 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.789
 what is the beat flyin is a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.110
 new video game a spin off and a dlc 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.150
 a very substantial extension 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.409
 an expanding expansion p4 accuse you 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.539
 terms that you like most 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.490
 introduce a category that I don't have 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.080
 addressed during this video and 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.879
 then leave yours below 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.430
 answer but before saying goodbye I want 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.349
 also greet us but I also want to ask 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.180
 I'd kindly like one thing then 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.159
 and make the last episode of 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.360
 waiting for it beats online by going to 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.969
 collect the most interesting questions 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.439
 or frequent that you are going to do then if 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.089
 had any curiosity had 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.889
 questions relating to the basic world more 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.349
 dance in leave a comment below 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.080
 not with the question that maybe 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.649
 you wish you had answered again 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.419
 better 

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.439
 besides maybe a series of questions that 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.289
 they went to collect for the last one 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:31.999
 episode dedicated to a fuck of jokes 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.349
 online maybe you can even leave me 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.999
 maybe the themes you want 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.949
 be addressed in the episodes 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.870
 later for charity I already more or less 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.279
 idea of ​​how to structure the entire series 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.020
 that all the bets I want to make but 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.300
 maybe if I found a topic 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.060
 interesting that deserves to be 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.530
 then dealt with perhaps during a 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.759
 whole video here I thank you 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.349
 certainly brought also 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.060
 interesting I take inspiration from maybe 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.870
 some ideas you can give me 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.449
