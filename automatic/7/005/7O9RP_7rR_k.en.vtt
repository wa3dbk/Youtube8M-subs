a nil code system to these drywallers

the<00:05:26.669> drywall<00:05:27.090> in-house<00:05:27.479> we<00:05:28.320> found<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.860> the

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
the drywall in-house we found that the

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.490 
the drywall in-house we found that the
system<00:05:29.430> goes<00:05:29.669> more<00:05:29.910> smoothly<00:05:30.360> it's<00:05:31.289> more

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
system goes more smoothly it's more

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.980 
system goes more smoothly it's more
efficient<00:05:32.039> it's<00:05:32.550> actually<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:32.970> time<00:05:33.270> saver<00:05:33.660> and

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
efficient it's actually a time saver and

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.290 
efficient it's actually a time saver and
we<00:05:34.470> end<00:05:34.650> up<00:05:34.830> with<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.009> cleaner<00:05:35.370> job<00:05:35.490> well<00:05:36.270> I

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
we end up with a cleaner job well I

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.140 
we end up with a cleaner job well I
would<00:05:36.599> recommend<00:05:37.169> using<00:05:38.009> no<00:05:38.310> coat<00:05:38.610> corners

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
because it works at the win-win across

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.600 
because it works at the win-win across
