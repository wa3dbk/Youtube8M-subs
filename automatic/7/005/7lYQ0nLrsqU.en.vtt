injection this is an injection of Dexter

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.990

dormitory<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.220> look<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.580> might<00:01:08.880> have

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
dormitory so as we look I might have

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.590 
dormitory so as we look I might have
said<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:10.159> previously<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.240> looking

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
said it previously that I was looking

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
said it previously that I was looking
for<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> Oh<00:01:13.200> eNOS<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.549> trying<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> see

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
for the Oh eNOS and I was trying to see

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.370 
for the Oh eNOS and I was trying to see
if<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> had<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:17.060> more<00:01:18.060> accurately<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
if it had one but more accurately I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
if it had one but more accurately I
think<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> eNOS<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
think that the eNOS I think that this is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.149 
think that the eNOS I think that this is
the<00:01:24.270> vulva<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> anus<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
the vulva and and I think the anus is

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.140 
the vulva and and I think the anus is
right<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> shelf<00:01:32.150> between

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
right there so there's a shelf between

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.289 
right there so there's a shelf between
the<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.439> let<00:01:35.159> me<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> thermometer<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the two now let me get a thermometer and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.670 
the two now let me get a thermometer and
I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> poops<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I think what it poops it's kind of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940 
I think what it poops it's kind of
pooping<00:01:38.009> over<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.790> vagina<00:01:39.799> sounds<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
pooping over the vagina sounds like a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
pooping over the vagina sounds like a
song<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.820> use<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.150> thermometer<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
song and they use my thermometer and you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.190 
song and they use my thermometer and you
can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
can see they actually you can see the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
can see they actually you can see the
anal<00:01:46.829> sphincter<00:01:47.520> working<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.399> actually

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
anal sphincter working and and actually

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.600 
anal sphincter working and and actually
I<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:51.470> boy<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.310> yeah

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there it goes so the the thermometer is

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
there it goes so the the thermometer is
going<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.329> into<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.869> anus<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:59.100> there's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
going up into the anus and then there's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.469 
going up into the anus and then there's
a<00:01:59.340> shelf<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> vagina<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> down

whether we're going to keep the puppy or
not<00:03:51.830> um<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.970> could<00:03:53.300> possibly<00:03:53.840> do<00:03:54.020> a<00:03:54.050> surgery

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
not um you could possibly do a surgery

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.010 
not um you could possibly do a surgery
and<00:03:54.800> reconstruct<00:03:55.610> that<00:03:55.700> little<00:03:56.000> shelf<00:03:56.270> but

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
and reconstruct that little shelf but

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.840 
and reconstruct that little shelf but
there<00:03:57.320> might<00:03:57.500> be<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.800> lot<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.190> problems<00:03:58.670> you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
there might be a lot of problems you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.890 
there might be a lot of problems you
don't<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.210> probably<00:03:59.360> have<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.660> do<00:03:59.780> it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
don't have to probably have to do it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.260 
don't have to probably have to do it
later<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.470> puppy's<00:04:00.830> life<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.460> they<00:04:02.060> can

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
later in the puppy's life and they can

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.600 
later in the puppy's life and they can
always<00:04:02.540> irritate<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.530> tear<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.190> surgery

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
always irritate and tear the surgery

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.090 
always irritate and tear the surgery
apart<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.810> there's<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.530> lot<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.709> think<00:04:06.980> about

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
apart so there's a lot to think about

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.440 
apart so there's a lot to think about
but<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.760> thought<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.180> might<00:04:08.240> be

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
but I just thought it might be

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.449 
but I just thought it might be
interesting<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.530> see<00:04:09.890> the
