00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
we had to clear the entire barbell strip

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.750 
we had to clear the entire barbell strip
it<00:03:42.420> all<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> way<00:03:42.720> down<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.200> then<00:03:44.100> put<00:03:44.430> three

it all the way down and then put three

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.360 
it all the way down and then put three
hundreds<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.330> each<00:03:45.480> side<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.080> then<00:03:46.950> reload

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
hundreds on each side and then reload

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.430 
hundreds on each side and then reload
