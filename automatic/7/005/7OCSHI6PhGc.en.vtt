00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
there earlier today I think everybody

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.700 
there earlier today I think everybody
they<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> two-tire<00:01:59.790> rule<00:02:00.210> here

only<00:02:00.860> really<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.370> I<00:02:01.400> thought<00:02:01.729> everybody's

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
only really so I thought everybody's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
going to be on the same stuff just kinda

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.410 
going to be on the same stuff just kinda
a<00:02:03.710> little<00:02:03.830> magic<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.430> how<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.640> might<00:02:04.850> groom<00:02:05.270> or
