now<00:00:27.520> we'll<00:00:27.700> just<00:00:27.850> see<00:00:28.510> how<00:00:28.960> we're<00:00:29.110> framing<00:00:29.470> in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
now we'll just see how we're framing in

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.300 
now we'll just see how we're framing in
the<00:00:29.650> hairline<00:00:30.010> and<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.590> left<00:00:32.800> side<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.220> the

the<00:00:38.120> chin<00:00:38.390> very<00:00:38.960> lightly

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.100 

and<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:51.430> little<00:00:52.430> bit<00:00:52.600> layout<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.840> clothing

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
and a little bit layout of the clothing

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.840 
and a little bit layout of the clothing
without<00:00:54.950> too<00:00:55.190> much<00:00:55.340> detail<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:55.910> there<00:00:56.180> yet

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
without too much detail you there yet

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.150 
without too much detail you there yet
now<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.600> just<00:01:00.580> find<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.640> flat<00:01:01.970> of<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.150> pencil

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.440 

shade<00:01:07.160> in<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:08.979> largest<00:01:09.979> mass<00:01:10.370> first<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
shade in the largest mass first the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.010 
shade in the largest mass first the
eyebrow<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:16.670> how<00:01:16.960> systematic<00:01:18.400> it<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:20.020> every

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
eyebrow see how systematic it is every

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.020 
eyebrow see how systematic it is every
drawing<00:01:21.260> every<00:01:21.460> portrait<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.550> has<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.790> same

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
drawing every portrait it has the same

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.530 
drawing every portrait it has the same
system<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:25.369> have<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.580> be<00:01:25.670> real<00:01:25.820> systematic

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
system you have to be real systematic

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.690 
system you have to be real systematic
when<00:01:27.530> you're<00:01:27.649> drawing<00:01:27.800> portraits<00:01:28.070> my<00:01:28.430> father

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
when you're drawing portraits my father

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.090 
when you're drawing portraits my father
always<00:01:28.970> taught<00:01:29.240> me<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:30.130> be<00:01:31.130> systematic<00:01:33.100> and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
always taught me to be systematic and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:46.870 
always taught me to be systematic and
you<00:01:35.060> get<00:01:35.210> things<00:01:35.450> done<00:01:36.910> better

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.030 

now<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:47.540> those<00:01:47.689> eyebrows<00:01:48.140> are<00:01:48.320> correct<00:01:48.650> see

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
now if those eyebrows are correct see

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.420 
now if those eyebrows are correct see
then<00:01:49.280> our<00:01:50.259> framework<00:01:51.259> for<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.590> eyes<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
then our framework for the eyes is

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.600 
then our framework for the eyes is
correct

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
correct

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.690 
correct
we<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:56.720> really<00:01:57.020> that's<00:01:57.770> really<00:01:57.830> this<00:01:58.490> kind

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
we just really that's really this kind

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.889 
we just really that's really this kind
of<00:01:58.790> drawing<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.299> loosens<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.810> up<00:01:59.920> you

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
of drawing really loosens you up you

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.090 
of drawing really loosens you up you
really<00:02:02.899> makes<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.500> how<00:02:03.950> big<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:06.409> first<00:02:06.890> eye

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
really makes you how big this first eye

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.380 
really makes you how big this first eye
is<00:02:08.920> because<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.009> other<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.280> has<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.610> match<00:02:10.819> it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.320 

and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:18.850> we'll<00:02:19.850> determine<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.989> eye<00:02:21.230> by

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
and then we'll determine this eye by

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:39.890 
and then we'll determine this eye by
looking<00:02:23.330> across<00:02:24.550> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.770 

especially<00:02:40.709> when<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> draw<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.160> iris<00:02:41.780> really

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
especially when to draw the iris really

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.040 
especially when to draw the iris really
have<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.920> looking<00:02:44.340> across<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:48.900> going

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
have to be looking across it's not going

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.259 
have to be looking across it's not going
to<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.170> perfect<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.440> our<00:02:52.560> lines<00:02:52.830> are<00:02:54.290> nice

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
to be perfect but if our lines are nice

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.949 
to be perfect but if our lines are nice
the<00:02:57.269> drawing<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.799> lines<00:02:59.250> will<00:02:59.430> carry

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the drawing will the lines will carry

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
the drawing will the lines will carry
the<00:03:00.959> likeness<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.760> it'll<00:03:04.010> allow<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.069> viewer

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the likeness and it'll allow the viewer

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.860 
the likeness and it'll allow the viewer
to<00:03:06.260> be<00:03:07.260> less<00:03:07.530> critical<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> drawing<00:03:11.870> it's

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
to be less critical of the drawing it's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.819 
to be less critical of the drawing it's
not<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> photograph<00:03:15.200> I'm<00:03:16.200> not<00:03:16.380> trying<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:17.329> get

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
not a photograph I'm not trying to get

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.259 
not a photograph I'm not trying to get
photographic<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.819> can't<00:03:21.060> be

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
photographic you know you can't be

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.080 
photographic you know you can't be
photographic<00:03:21.959> when<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.200> only<00:03:22.319> have<00:03:23.090> six

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
photographic when you only have six

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.589 
photographic when you only have six
minutes<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.400> an<00:03:26.519> awful<00:03:26.819> lot<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.000> yourself

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
minutes but an awful lot of yourself

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.800 
minutes but an awful lot of yourself
comes<00:03:28.410> through<00:03:28.940> when<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.120> set<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.390> limits

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
comes through when you set your limits

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.809 
comes through when you set your limits
like<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:33.560> because<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:35.209> make<00:03:36.209> choices<00:03:37.819> that

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
like this because you make choices that

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.960 
like this because you make choices that
you<00:03:38.970> otherwise<00:03:39.530> wouldn't<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:41.010> make<00:03:41.220> if

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
you otherwise wouldn't have to make if

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.990 
you otherwise wouldn't have to make if
you<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.660> an<00:03:42.810> endless<00:03:43.319> amount<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.799> time<00:03:45.319> and

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
you have an endless amount of time and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.240 
you have an endless amount of time and
the<00:03:48.000> choices<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.630> make<00:03:48.950> those<00:03:49.950> are<00:03:50.100> what

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the choices that you make those are what

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.300 
the choices that you make those are what
make<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:51.239> drawing<00:03:51.540> unique

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.620 

and<00:03:59.590> nobody's<00:04:00.590> gonna<00:04:00.680> draw<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.070> same<00:04:01.370> way

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
and nobody's gonna draw the same way

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:11.320 
and nobody's gonna draw the same way
when<00:04:02.630> they<00:04:02.750> only<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:04.120> six<00:04:05.120> minutes<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.540> draw

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.590 

if<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.990> have<00:04:12.140> six<00:04:12.500> months<00:04:12.830> to<00:04:12.950> draw<00:04:13.100> something

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
if you have six months to draw something

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.460 
if you have six months to draw something
your<00:04:14.600> drawings<00:04:14.900> going<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.080> look<00:04:15.200> more<00:04:15.380> and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
your drawings going to look more and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.440 
your drawings going to look more and
more<00:04:15.560> like<00:04:15.700> everybody<00:04:16.700> else<00:04:16.880> who<00:04:17.060> draws<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
more like everybody else who draws the
