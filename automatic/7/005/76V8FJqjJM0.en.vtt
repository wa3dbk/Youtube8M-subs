00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 and hello everyone with you dos 13 and today 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.710
 Before you new issue of heading let's 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.990
 will discuss 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 last time we reviewed one of the most 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 important and urgent problems of our game 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.660
 Well, in this video, I would like to talk 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.990
 About Serb Goldie 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 and its advantages and disadvantages are given 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 fitchu led the world of tanks for a long time 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.029
 And she was aimed immediately on several 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 achievements 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 the most important as far as I can remember the reason 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.110
 for the introduction of gold for silver has become 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.719
 model fritupley ie model 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 completely free game before the introduction 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.559
 players had to put their real 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.930
 account money to purchase 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.750
 cumulative and piercing projectiles and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 also some consumables of course 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.600
 there were several more reasons 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.760
 eg 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 it was difficult for players on the global map 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.410
 to fight with all sorts of wealthy clans 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 but we must not forget about 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.460
 cyber sportsmen anyway 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.710
 developers have introduced a servo gold 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 looked a month or another analyzed 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.000
 and decided to leave her 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.830
 but always and as soon as it happened 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 Immediately there were a lot of guys who 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.659
 charged ammunition fully gold 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 projectiles and not thinking pain relieving 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 points 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.720
 shot at avtopritsele and punched a little 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 later or even at that time got out 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.630
 objects 268 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.880
 50 fours out and sixths and so on in 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 general rose wine on this occasion all 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 more and more often the gaming community expressed 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.170
 discontent and complained about wargaming 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 I agree that earlier heavy tanks 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.909
 possessing really good armor 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.670
 felt much more comfortable in those 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.890
 times gold was shot very rarely 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 mainly carried with them 34 projectile on 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.570
 case if at the very end you have to 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.820
 drag the fight on the other hand the weak 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.680
 tanks with a terrible weapon appeared 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
 the ability to play at least some 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.259
 convenience, you can go to the enemy board and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.850
 feed or cure vulnerabilities but on 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 some machines it was impossible 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.900
 I just didn't want to play on them 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.030
 before 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.250
 Gold's visions unfortunately most 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.729
 players shoots a Serb gold right and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.610
 left 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.130
 having a wonderful opportunity many 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.380
 as they say abused sometimes 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.240
 randomly, you can meet with t57 heavy 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.090
 shooting completely cumulative 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.670
 shells or with a flash drive on a hash mine 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 good developers guessed doing 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.900
 normalization for cumulative 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.200
 ammunition and nerf breakout from a hash 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.540
 mines fv215b 183 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
 I believe that gold shells for silver 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.430
 need despite all the flaws 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.770
 most likely you need to limit them 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.200
 allowable amount to players 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.820
 sparingly used them on those guns 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.310
 who can safely do without 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.860
 of this then the tankers will be heavy 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.990
 less annoyed maybe not worth 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.300
 limit their number and increase 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.910
 the cost of shells in general is 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.560
 several solutions to this problem hope 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.130
 what in the future wargaming anything 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 will decide 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.200
 and finally do well and in the case of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.570
 gold consumables everything is fine here 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.120
 There is nothing to discuss because the problems are just 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.190
 I personally do not expect from you 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.920
 comments from your point of view 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.170
 be sure to write your opinion as well 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.540
 possible solution to this problem is possible 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.720
 our positions on this issue will coincide 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.700
 I have done everything right with this 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 from all sides to state the whole point 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.239
 gold problems for silver 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.620
 if you liked the video then 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.510
 be sure to put likes and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.000
 dos 13 all successful bend and all for now
