pedal<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.739> my<00:02:51.890> main<00:02:52.070> pedal<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:53.600> delay<00:02:53.900> i

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
pedal it's my main pedal for delay i

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.620 
pedal it's my main pedal for delay i
just<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.190> delay<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.239> because<00:02:56.360> i<00:02:56.480> don't

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
just use the delay on it because i don't

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.080 
just use the delay on it because i don't
really<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.170> reverb<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:58.400> up<00:02:58.640> next

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
really like the reverb but then up next

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.280 
really like the reverb but then up next
I<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.510> learned<00:02:59.959> six<00:03:00.440> echo<00:03:00.980> park<00:03:01.310> um<00:03:02.290> I'm

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
I have learned six echo park um I'm

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.600 
I have learned six echo park um I'm
probably<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.800> switch<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.190> guy<00:03:04.430> out

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
probably going to switch this guy out

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.360 
probably going to switch this guy out
eventually<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.540> for<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.830> have<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.280> on

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
eventually but for now I just have it on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.790 
eventually but for now I just have it on
I<00:03:07.730> i<00:03:08.300> use<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.780> swell<00:03:09.019> function<00:03:09.440> gets<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> on

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
I i use the swell function gets it on

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.509 
I i use the swell function gets it on
with<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.980> volume<00:03:10.280> pedal<00:03:10.310> yet<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:12.310> it's<00:03:13.310> still

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
with a volume pedal yet so it's still

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.130 
with a volume pedal yet so it's still
look<00:03:13.640> at<00:03:13.760> pedal<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.720> looking

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
look at pedal I just I'm just looking

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.840 
look at pedal I just I'm just looking
for<00:03:15.290> something<00:03:15.440> else<00:03:15.650> though<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.100> then<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.820> i

for something else though and then so i
have<00:03:17.030> three<00:03:17.329> delays<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> screen<00:03:18.170> I've<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
have three delays in the screen I've the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.509 
have three delays in the screen I've the
space<00:03:19.850> echo<00:03:20.180> echo<00:03:20.840> park<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.470> then<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.479 
space echo echo park and then I have a
vintage<00:03:22.790> time<00:03:23.269> machine<00:03:23.630> boybander<00:03:24.560> which<00:03:25.280> I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
vintage time machine boybander which I

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.050 
vintage time machine boybander which I
know<00:03:25.549> manager<00:03:26.180> gets<00:03:26.959> bad<00:03:27.230> rip<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.670> mean

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060

know manager gets bad rip and I mean
whatever<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.989> have<00:03:30.260> I've<00:03:31.130> come<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:31.579> this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
whatever I have I've come to like this

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.660 
whatever I have I've come to like this
pedal<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.299> really<00:03:32.720> Spacey<00:03:33.380> it's<00:03:34.130> basically

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
pedal it's really Spacey it's basically

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.500 
pedal it's really Spacey it's basically
a<00:03:34.760> copy<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:36.130> what<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.370> memory<00:03:37.610> boy<00:03:39.489> but

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
a copy of the what is the memory boy but

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.229 
a copy of the what is the memory boy but
yeah<00:03:41.510> it's<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.170> really<00:03:42.440> awesome<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:43.730> gives

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
yeah it's it's really awesome it gives

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.590 
yeah it's it's really awesome it gives
my<00:03:44.480> sound<00:03:45.079> really<00:03:45.560> dreamy<00:03:46.660> sound<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.320> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
my sound really dreamy sound I like it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.890 
my sound really dreamy sound I like it
so<00:03:50.600> then<00:03:50.840> that's<00:03:51.440> my<00:03:51.650> delay<00:03:52.209> damn<00:03:53.209> band<00:03:53.600> band

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
so then that's my delay damn band band

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.890 
so then that's my delay damn band band
and<00:03:54.200> back<00:03:54.380> into<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.890> looper<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.390> then<00:03:56.600> next

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and back into the looper and then next

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.979 
and back into the looper and then next
up<00:03:57.170> I've<00:03:57.350> modulation<00:03:58.070> which<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.299> guy<00:03:59.480> TC

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
up I've modulation which is this guy TC

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.069 
up I've modulation which is this guy TC
electronic<00:04:00.590> it's<00:04:01.250> uh<00:04:01.549> it's<00:04:02.060> basically<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.690> dual

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
electronic it's uh it's basically a dual

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.460 
electronic it's uh it's basically a dual
engine<00:04:03.650> for<00:04:04.610> modulation<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.420> get<00:04:06.230> two

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
engine for modulation so you get two

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.310 
engine for modulation so you get two
sides<00:04:06.799> basically<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:08.299> get<00:04:08.510> course<00:04:08.930> start

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
sides basically and you get course start

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.080 
sides basically and you get course start
course<00:04:09.560> flanger<00:04:10.130> phaser<00:04:10.160> trim<00:04:10.880> little

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
course flanger phaser trim little

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
course flanger phaser trim little
vibrato<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.840> it's<00:04:12.680> got<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.829> cool<00:04:13.010> tap<00:04:13.250> tempo<00:04:13.519> um

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
vibrato and it's got a cool tap tempo um

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.259 
vibrato and it's got a cool tap tempo um
you<00:04:15.650> basically<00:04:16.160> combine<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.850> effects

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
you basically combine the effects

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.610 
you basically combine the effects
together<00:04:17.630> like<00:04:18.620> say<00:04:19.370> oh<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.580> want<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:20.060> course<00:04:20.660> and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
together like say oh I want a course and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.600 
together like say oh I want a course and
tremolo<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.850> can<00:04:23.169> edit<00:04:24.169> each<00:04:24.500> effect<00:04:24.919> like

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
tremolo you can edit each effect like

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.189 
tremolo you can edit each effect like
different<00:04:26.360> speeds<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.810> everything<00:04:27.080> it's

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
different speeds and everything it's

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.530 
different speeds and everything it's
really<00:04:27.530> cool<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:28.940> want<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.240> sync

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
really cool if you want you can sync

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.110 
really cool if you want you can sync
them<00:04:29.630> up<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.229> there<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.470> time<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.760> really

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
them up so there in time and just really

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.370 
them up so there in time and just really
cool<00:04:32.360> battle<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.830> then<00:04:34.010> up<00:04:34.280> next<00:04:34.880> a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
cool battle and then up next a

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.870 
cool battle and then up next a
distortion<00:04:36.380> right<00:04:37.130> there<00:04:37.430> below<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:40.340> oh<00:04:40.639> yeah

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
distortion right there below so oh yeah

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.460 
distortion right there below so oh yeah
and<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.240> reason<00:04:41.510> these<00:04:41.600> are<00:04:41.780> both<00:04:41.900> or<00:04:42.139> upside

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
and the reason these are both or upside

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.450 
and the reason these are both or upside
down<00:04:42.850> well<00:04:43.850> actually<00:04:44.530> it's<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.740> easier<00:04:46.220> for

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
down well actually it's just easier for

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.150 
down well actually it's just easier for
me<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.330> run<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.139> cables<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:48.979> guy's

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
me to run the cables and this guy's

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.570 
me to run the cables and this guy's
upside<00:04:49.580> down<00:04:49.699> because<00:04:50.199> Russian<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:52.280> Russian

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
upside down because Russian the Russian

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.400 
upside down because Russian the Russian
big<00:04:52.729> mouths<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.120> inputs<00:04:53.479> are<00:04:53.690> switched<00:04:54.050> so

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
big mouths the inputs are switched so

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.350 
big mouths the inputs are switched so
it's<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.620> easier<00:04:55.039> that<00:04:55.100> way<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:56.000> since<00:04:56.270> I

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
it's just easier that way and since I

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.330 
it's just easier that way and since I
have<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:56.720> here<00:04:57.080> anyways<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.650> turn<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:57.979> on<00:04:58.100> it

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
have this here anyways to turn it on it

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.750 
have this here anyways to turn it on it
doesn't<00:04:58.580> really<00:04:58.910> matter<00:04:59.120> but<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:01.430> Russian

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
doesn't really matter but the Russian

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.469

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
big muff is the great distortion pedal I

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.800 
big muff is the great distortion pedal I
don't<00:05:06.169> change<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.590> settings<00:05:06.979> much<00:05:07.190> usually

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
don't change the settings much usually

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.860 
don't change the settings much usually

starts getting on the focus so yeah
that's<00:05:12.229> that's<00:05:12.979> great<00:05:13.430> distortion<00:05:14.949> up<00:05:15.949> next

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
that's that's great distortion up next

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
the joystick it controls the amount of

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.570 
the joystick it controls the amount of
fuzz<00:06:44.320> are<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.590> tone<00:06:45.800> of<00:06:45.830> it<00:06:46.009> I'm<00:06:46.160> sorry<00:06:46.340> and

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
switches for the vintage funds you get

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.680 
switches for the vintage funds you get
you<00:06:51.710> can<00:06:51.860> get<00:06:51.979> like<00:06:52.100> a<00:06:52.280> chaos<00:06:52.940> which<00:06:53.210> is<00:06:53.360> really

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
you can get like a chaos which is really

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.810 
you can get like a chaos which is really
crazy<00:06:53.960> and<00:06:54.139> that<00:06:54.350> noise<00:06:54.590> so<00:06:55.520> if<00:06:55.580> you<00:06:55.639> want<00:06:55.789> to

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
crazy and that noise so if you want to

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.180 
crazy and that noise so if you want to
add<00:06:56.030> like<00:06:56.240> a<00:06:56.270> more<00:06:56.660> crazy<00:06:57.320> sound<00:06:57.710> and<00:06:57.979> I<00:06:58.039> was

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
add like a more crazy sound and I was

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.180 
add like a more crazy sound and I was
really<00:06:58.400> good<00:06:58.639> for<00:06:58.850> them<00:06:59.440> for<00:07:00.440> noise<00:07:00.650> and<00:07:00.979> stuff

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
really good for them for noise and stuff

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.670 
really good for them for noise and stuff
and<00:07:01.460> then<00:07:01.910> this<00:07:02.210> side<00:07:02.509> you<00:07:03.080> have<00:07:03.199> oscillation

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
and then this side you have oscillation

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.439 
and then this side you have oscillation
which<00:07:04.130> is<00:07:04.250> really<00:07:04.580> cool<00:07:04.789> because<00:07:04.940> then<00:07:05.060> when

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
which is really cool because then when

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.450 
which is really cool because then when
you<00:07:05.539> move<00:07:05.720> the<00:07:05.900> novel<00:07:06.289> either<00:07:06.650> the<00:07:07.039> joystick

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
you move the novel either the joystick

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.029 
you move the novel either the joystick
around<00:07:07.699> you<00:07:08.360> get<00:07:08.479> really<00:07:08.720> like<00:07:09.039> cool

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
around you get really like cool

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.110 
around you get really like cool
oscillating<00:07:10.699> by<00:07:11.389> Sun<00:07:11.720> so<00:07:11.960> i<00:07:11.990> use<00:07:12.259> this<00:07:13.120> leads

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
oscillating by Sun so i use this leads

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.810 
oscillating by Sun so i use this leads
and<00:07:14.449> stuff<00:07:14.720> sometimes<00:07:15.310> like<00:07:16.310> an<00:07:16.430> i<00:07:16.520> don't<00:07:16.669> use

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
and stuff sometimes like an i don't use

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.900 
and stuff sometimes like an i don't use
this<00:07:16.970> all<00:07:17.150> the<00:07:17.210> time<00:07:17.449> in<00:07:17.810> my<00:07:17.930> rig<00:07:18.139> but<00:07:18.910> yeah

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
this all the time in my rig but yeah

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.180 
this all the time in my rig but yeah
that's<00:07:20.150> my<00:07:20.360> pedalboard<00:07:20.930> so<00:07:21.740> i'm<00:07:21.889> not<00:07:22.009> very

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
that's my pedalboard so i'm not very

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.499 
that's my pedalboard so i'm not very
good<00:07:22.340> at<00:07:22.490> demonstrations<00:07:23.449> and<00:07:24.699> but<00:07:25.699> yeah<00:07:25.849> and

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.780 
good at demonstrations and but yeah and
this<00:07:27.160> thanks<00:07:28.160> for<00:07:28.400> listening<00:07:28.820> and<00:07:29.000> yet
