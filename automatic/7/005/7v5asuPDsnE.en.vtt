00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
white is just really gaining space and

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.279 
white is just really gaining space and
control<00:05:28.120> some<00:05:28.300> more<00:05:28.419> crucial<00:05:28.810> squares<00:05:29.110> here

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
control some more crucial squares here

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.139 
control some more crucial squares here
looking<00:05:32.289> fate<00:05:32.469> is<00:05:32.649> plays<00:05:32.949> probably<00:05:33.669> because

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:34.149 
looking fate is plays probably because

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:37.889 
looking fate is plays probably because
King<00:05:34.990> f7<00:05:35.379> can't<00:05:35.680> be<00:05:36.399> played<00:05:36.639> yet<00:05:36.909> so<00:05:37.270> black<00:05:37.719> is

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:37.899 
King f7 can't be played yet so black is

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:41.490 
King f7 can't be played yet so black is
just<00:05:38.939> buying<00:05:39.939> time<00:05:40.210> he's<00:05:40.569> not<00:05:40.719> really<00:05:40.870> doing

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
just buying time he's not really doing

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100 
just buying time he's not really doing
anything<00:05:41.740> he's<00:05:42.520> just<00:05:42.729> essentially<00:05:43.509> passing

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
anything he's just essentially passing

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.709 
anything he's just essentially passing
and<00:05:46.289> well<00:05:47.289> I<00:05:47.319> suppose<00:05:47.800> one<00:05:48.569> advantage<00:05:49.569> of

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
and well I suppose one advantage of

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.809 
and well I suppose one advantage of
rookie<00:05:49.990> fate<00:05:50.229> is<00:05:50.469> that<00:05:50.710> when<00:05:50.889> King<00:05:51.129> comes<00:05:51.310> f7

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
rookie fate is that when King comes f7

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.399 
rookie fate is that when King comes f7
it<00:05:51.909> can<00:05:52.060> come<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.330> jail<00:05:52.539> immediately<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:53.259> is

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
it can come to jail immediately this is

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.649 
it can come to jail immediately this is
a<00:05:53.469> manual<00:05:53.740> form<00:05:54.069> of<00:05:54.189> Carson<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:55.240> it's<00:05:55.360> not<00:05:55.479> done

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
a manual form of Carson so it's not done

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.050 
a manual form of Carson so it's not done
automatically<00:05:56.169> but<00:05:57.099> what<00:05:57.580> but<00:05:57.849> black

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
automatically but what but black

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
of these open faults and that's what

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.050 
of these open faults and that's what
gives<00:06:11.169> him<00:06:11.439> a<00:06:11.649> very<00:06:12.129> comfortable<00:06:12.370> lead<00:06:12.879> in

and this bitch 1g six
f5<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.820> an<00:06:24.000> attempt<00:06:24.510> to<00:06:24.540> solve<00:06:25.290> those<00:06:25.920> exact

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
f5 is an attempt to solve those exact

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.240 
f5 is an attempt to solve those exact
problems<00:06:27.230> so<00:06:28.400> this<00:06:29.400> opens<00:06:29.760> up<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:31.250> dark

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
problems so this opens up the dark

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.240 
problems so this opens up the dark
square<00:06:32.520> Bishop<00:06:33.230> which<00:06:34.230> can<00:06:34.440> happen<00:06:34.590> come<00:06:35.070> to

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
square Bishop which can happen come to

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.240 
square Bishop which can happen come to
g5<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:35.940> also<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.020> tries<00:06:37.230> to<00:06:37.260> nibble<00:06:37.920> away<00:06:38.130> at

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
g5 and also it tries to nibble away at

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.580 
g5 and also it tries to nibble away at
White's<00:06:38.730> pawn<00:06:39.030> chain<00:06:39.240> which<00:06:39.720> must<00:06:40.230> commit

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
White's pawn chain which must commit

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.490 
White's pawn chain which must commit
which<00:06:41.220> must<00:06:41.460> commit<00:06:41.790> itself<00:06:42.060> and<00:06:42.570> so<00:06:43.200> it<00:06:43.290> does

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
which must commit itself and so it does

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.410 
which must commit itself and so it does
with<00:06:43.800> e<00:06:44.010> 40<00:06:44.640> 5<00:06:46.100> Bishop<00:06:47.100> g5<00:06:47.490> attacks<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.210> rook

with e 40 5 Bishop g5 attacks the rook

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:58.610 
with e 40 5 Bishop g5 attacks the rook
and<00:06:50.330> really<00:06:52.640> Bishop<00:06:53.640> e3<00:06:53.790> is<00:06:54.150> force<00:06:54.450> now<00:06:57.620> this

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
and really Bishop e3 is force now this

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.950 
and really Bishop e3 is force now this
allows<00:06:58.920> an<00:06:59.070> exchange<00:06:59.520> but<00:06:59.940> Anna<00:07:00.150> makes<00:07:00.750> the

allows an exchange but Anna makes the

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.640 
allows an exchange but Anna makes the
interesting<00:07:01.260> decision<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.980> play<00:07:03.080> f5f<00:07:04.080> for<00:07:04.350> he

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
had to fit for see the following tactic

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.940 
had to fit for see the following tactic
but<00:07:07.680> it<00:07:08.310> worked<00:07:08.610> and<00:07:08.880> it<00:07:09.650> definitely<00:07:10.650> creates

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
but it worked and it definitely creates

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.640 
but it worked and it definitely creates
some<00:07:11.220> complications<00:07:12.020> we<00:07:13.020> see<00:07:13.200> it<00:07:13.290> instead

f3 to f4 I know move like due to g3 well
that's<00:07:36.180> not<00:07:36.390> necessary<00:07:36.810> it's<00:07:37.140> just<00:07:37.350> simply<00:07:37.650> to

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 
that's not necessary it's just simply to

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.470 
that's not necessary it's just simply to
demonstrate<00:07:38.340> you<00:07:38.730> can<00:07:38.910> erect<00:07:39.120> a<00:07:39.270> pawn

this light squared Bishop doesn't do
anything<00:07:44.100> so<00:07:44.400> this<00:07:44.490> is<00:07:44.550> just<00:07:44.790> an<00:07:44.880> ultimate<00:07:45.360> bad

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840

Bishop case so that's why and then wants
