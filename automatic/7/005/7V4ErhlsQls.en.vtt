00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.250
 that responsibility and that honor in 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.730
 special to the town of my river town 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.460
 quarter 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.500
 I wanted this last parade of the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.660
 independence was made in our 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.700
 capital alternates as a tribute a 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 recognition of all forces 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.850
 productive cultural workers to the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.660
 riocuartense family that do so much for 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.460
 the homeland and by cordoba this parade 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.110
 civic-military we are going to have a 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.900
 important presence of our forces 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.180
 armed of the security force but 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.490
 also from the collectivities of all 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 those who do daily life and it is 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.450
 so good that it's because 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.070
 independence is not a date the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.130
 independence must conquer to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.440
 every day a country is truly 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.990
 independent when you have citizens 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 that are not in misery a country is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.760
 truly independent when not 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.290
 there are malnourished children a country is 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.539
 truly independent when there 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 a good education a country is 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.990
 truly independent when there 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.149
 job opportunity for young people 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.189
 a country is true independent 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.799
 truly independent when there 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.390
 respect among those who think differently and 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.210
 when the dignity of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.920
 woman and there is no rapper is like 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 unfortunately , a country is 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.659
 independent when security is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.189
 guarantees providing opportunities to 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.740
 the young guys so they do not take the 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.289
 wrong way and applying the law with everything 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.509
 rigor to the crime band the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.090
 independence you have to conquer it day 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.280
 after today we celebrate a fact 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.060
 historical but we still need a lot to be 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.060
 independent 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.629
 you can back 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.550
 my truth 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.550
 freedom freedom 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.109
 the first thing is the presence of a lot 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.129
 people in the alternate capital of the 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:34.170
 province of Córdoba and as such 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.920
 a lot of people participating in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.409
 this day a day that for me is really 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.359
 one of the days very much that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.049
 significant for our Argentina 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:49.200
 because it implies precisely that our 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.150
 independence began to have a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 much greater strength from the looks 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.730
 of different men who were capable of 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.400
 sign that act of independence like that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.470
 that always thinking about a construction 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.849
 from a young country of many years 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.159
 He is already walking towards 1916 to the bicentennial of 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.069
 the declaration of independence and 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.010
 really a country where I think you have 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.389
 that combine the different looks that well 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.840
 as in those at that time 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.240
 there were different looks has a call 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.730
 a call precisely 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.250
 and make all eyes talk 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.960
 in the differences to think about a 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.210
 argentina more powerful in an argentina 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.640
 more united in an Argentina that 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.220
 raised long-term goals you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.230
 pose strategies and programs in the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.370
 short and medium term that lead those 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.020
 objectives and that are capable of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 different programs are sustained in 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.470
 the time from the different looks 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.710
 so that once and for all we can 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.780
 say with great pride of that Argentina 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.440
 that we always dream in Argentina that 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.140
 we are achieving very good 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.069
 never 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 but you see something like that 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.150
 the epp and the numerous groupings with 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.620
 participation of all 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.700
 authorities the province of the city 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.700
 very cute beautiful I loved remember 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:19.539
 very very proud because I have my grandson 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.539

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.539
 I liked it a lot I think now 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 many years I'm seeing everything very beautiful 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.759
 most beautiful story can not be 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.789
 I congratulate the governor because 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.009
 really this is very educational and 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.650
 constructive for all I feel 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.380
 proud if really many years ago 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.430
 that you did not see something like that is exciting 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.430
