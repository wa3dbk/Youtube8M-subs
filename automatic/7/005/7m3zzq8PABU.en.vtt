00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.819
 I support action not the program 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.460
 official I react month trend to do 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.330
 alternative proof spontaneously and I'm 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 realize that it is not necessary 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.980
 so suddenly we have a lot less 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 pressure to say to oneself one has to be more 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 malignant that the pedagogical x tried one who 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 have defined the official program that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.110
 changes every year that have all the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 two years and what was true five years 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.010
 after become heresy anyway 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.700
 in the background nothing changes must 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.700
 everything changes so nothing changes 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 we 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.490
 1 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 1 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.800
 in the social culture so if I adopt 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.720
 the rules the principles and the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.270
 values ​​of a sociocultural I am 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.309
 integrated and I survive because if I 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.030
 do not do that I'm rejected I'm beaten 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 ends and that's the galley you know good 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.629
 so there is nothing wrong with following 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.600
 on this future it is even what it is 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.890
 to do in order to survive 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.510
 just at one point I can 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.940
 impose questions did not that 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.660
 that benefits 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.660
 personally I believed during 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.920
 fifty years as school and education 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.270
 national was that there was 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.270
 better and who made it them 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.729
 it was odious and horrible to padt not 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 educated when you say that German's 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.100
 school in society is because 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.410
 we do not need anymore to format you 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.410
 think that formatting will happen to us 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 so come the one of the passes where the school 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.220
 is an epiphenomenon in the history of 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 humanity is a construction 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 ideological social 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.240
 which does not mean that they 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.030
 did not exist before 1881 but they 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.530
 exercised for the benefit of the clergy before 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.930
 1880 and from 1880 it is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.670
 our profits from the state and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.770
 governors of the state france 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.810
 did not really exist so what 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.909
 that she put herself especially the republic 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.710
 so she started to exist through 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.869
 school and school was a way 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.709
 to impose for example French language 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.660
 everywhere leap from alphabetize but not 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.550
 to teach Lyon this is very clear 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.440
 and very specific in the fundamentals of 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.180
 the school dice from the beginning the school there 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.520
 this is especially not to teach to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 read his bloodletting to literate and to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.510
 count and maybe write but 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.250
 especially on for mandarins it's up to 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.040
 say the dominant since the language 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.360
 written this is another topic but the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 written language and the language of 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.569
 powers in general political religious 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.910
 etc. 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.860
 the rulers and the Republic were 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 the new ones dominating over the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.420
 clergy who had preceded and now 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.370
 I think that in recent years we have 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.500
 was in another category of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.440
 dominant who what they are that what 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.049
 I call the merchants that is to say the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.640
 economics economism and so the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.440
 merchants currently no longer need 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.360
 to shape the spirits of a 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.970
 school system that costs money 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.340
 what and that prevents them from continuing to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 get rich so there are other processes 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 including selling instruction by 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.560
 example here and so that's why 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.329
 I think this makes me what I observe a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.130
 game I see it's education 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.630
 national is being reduced 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.420
 but she will be substituted by bell 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.829
 by the means of poor communication 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.600
 named since if she does not know a 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.200
 communication the averages of 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.450
 the mass information that is the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.410
 press is that are the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.140
 televisions and who are these I believe 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.560
 that it is clear they are are controlled 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.750
 by the money powers and who 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.810
 politicians are forced to go through that 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.220
 to be eligible for election and re-election 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.580
 and so they are at the mercy of 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.580
 merchants 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.420
 autonomy in the school environment 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.790
 finally for those who know these 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.810
 even mayer maybe in the family 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.070
 so it's done 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.080
 I hope I do not reveal a secret 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.360
 it is that the other does everything alone what 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.340
 I wanted him to do I 'm not 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.070
 hungry this is autonomy at school 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.780
 is you going to go to the cdi where 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.270
 you go fishing where and then you go 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.820
 do your homework alone or now 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.860
 2.8 2.8 from 8 to 9 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.680
 this is it you do your homework in 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.680
 autonomy but hey I did not change anything 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.540
 there are a lot of things that are 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.390
 useful or kim would have been useful and that I 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.510
 did not learn at school what grace 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.120
 done 2nd 20 kg be quoted I have a 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.120
 incredible openness we do 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.610
 I can not get this opening on 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.620
 the world without going through school what 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.480
 has no other ways of other processes 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.450
 our way is what I have 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.730
 possibility at least to doubt the fact 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.950
 that only the school that can me 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.780
 give it and what should not 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.620
 means more economical than school 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.060
 to have this openness to the world 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.140
 I think the benefits that 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.140
 I attribute to school 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.470
 on any end in a general way 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.509
 are quite questionable that means 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.130
 that it's about discussing them 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.289
 to deepen them because there is 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.630
 always effectively arguments 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:48.080
 for school I get the arguments 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.789
 for school and I discuss it is 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.789
 because the benefits that up 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.530
 present we try to show me by 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.110
 report to school I do not see 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.440
 why can not I get them 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.479
 otherwise and if I observe a few cases 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.949
 minority individuals who are 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.020
 tolerated because they are in the minority 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:11.699
 otherwise they would not be tolerated is that 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.180
 we can arrive at results 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:18.419
 similar even superior in two times 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.470
 less time what if you want me 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.099
 I can tell you my experience 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.490
 personal I have had like maybe 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.880
 many of you are in English 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.880
 English classes 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.820
 well here it is not worth it that I 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:39.389
 continue the story we want 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.330
 control something that gets done 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.979
 alone what is my position what 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.990
 regards learning to take it's 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.849
 something natural and if 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.159
 I was not learning I will not survive so 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:53.699
 it's a sign that I'm learning everything 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:56.759
 moment and all my life and that I 'm leaving 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.789
 not indefinitely there is no limit 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:02.340
 and on it I plate an institution 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:05.039
 who will organize my to take and who in 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.360
 done under the pretext of organizing my to 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.009
 take it while it's something 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.740
 that I can do quite freely 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:13.800
 and spontaneously goes in reality to me 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.380
 control my to take of course and goes 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.120
 to make me learn things that do not 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.120
 not necessarily in my interest 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.990
 e
