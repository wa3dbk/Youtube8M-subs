00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
figure okay maybe I got a spun rod

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
looking thank spring and a nice curved

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.780 
looking thank spring and a nice curved
piece<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.510> metal<00:02:42.160> will<00:02:43.160> collect<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> spring

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
piece of metal will collect the spring

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.010 
piece of metal will collect the spring
actually<00:02:43.970> fits<00:02:44.360> right<00:02:44.540> inside<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:45.020> cylinder

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
actually fits right inside this cylinder

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.240 
actually fits right inside this cylinder
so<00:02:48.020> then<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.410> matter<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.860> trying<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
so then it was a matter of trying to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.470 
so then it was a matter of trying to
figure<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.520> where<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> hell<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.330> came

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
figure out where the hell this came

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.780 
figure out where the hell this came
from<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:54.250> looking<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> videos<00:02:55.610> online<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
from and looking to videos online and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.530 
from and looking to videos online and
flipping<00:02:58.790> through<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.030> children's<00:02:59.390> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
flipping through the children's and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.050 
flipping through the children's and
reading<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.780> bunch<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.050> stuff<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.940> only

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
reading a bunch of stuff on it the only

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.370 
reading a bunch of stuff on it the only
thing<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.300> found<00:03:02.510> they<00:03:02.660> had<00:03:02.780> plastic<00:03:02.990> because

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
thing I found they had plastic because

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.210 
thing I found they had plastic because
it<00:03:03.410> didn't<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.710> sense<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:04.010> there's

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
it didn't make sense that there's

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.040 
it didn't make sense that there's
plastic<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:04.850> there<00:03:05.260> was<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:08.030> tensioners<00:03:08.480> on

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
plastic in there was the tensioners on

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.140 
plastic in there was the tensioners on
the<00:03:09.230> timing<00:03:09.440> chains<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:12.610> here<00:03:13.610> comes<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.970> task

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
the timing chains so here comes the task

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.240 
the timing chains so here comes the task
of<00:03:14.450> pulling<00:03:14.660> off<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.140> timing<00:03:15.650> chain<00:03:15.680> upper

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
of pulling off the timing chain upper

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.810 
of pulling off the timing chain upper
cover<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.760> lower<00:03:17.480> cover<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.340> again<00:03:19.460> I'm<00:03:19.700> not

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
cover and lower cover and again I'm not

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.580 
cover and lower cover and again I'm not
a<00:03:19.850> mechanic<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:22.630> someone<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.780> only<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.500> know

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
a mechanic so someone that only you know

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.050 
a mechanic so someone that only you know
occasionally<00:03:25.130> did<00:03:25.280> their<00:03:25.430> own<00:03:25.550> oil<00:03:25.700> change

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
occasionally did their own oil change

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.370 
occasionally did their own oil change
and<00:03:26.240> stuff<00:03:26.390> like<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.750> it's<00:03:27.050> kind<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.260> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
and stuff like that so it's kind of a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.740 
and stuff like that so it's kind of a
challenge<00:03:27.770> with<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> tools<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
challenge with I have the tools and the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.980 
challenge with I have the tools and the
and<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.530> ability<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.600> went<00:03:32.600> ahead<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.810> went

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
and the ability so I went ahead and went

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.360 
and the ability so I went ahead and went
for<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:34.870> upper<00:03:35.870> cover<00:03:36.050> pulled<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.590> off<00:03:36.710> wasn't

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
for it upper cover pulled it off wasn't

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.170 
for it upper cover pulled it off wasn't
too<00:03:37.460> bad<00:03:38.620> upper<00:03:39.620> tensioner<00:03:40.250> everything<00:03:41.000> looks

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
too bad upper tensioner everything looks

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.250 
too bad upper tensioner everything looks
good

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
good

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.690 
good
nothing<00:03:42.890> looks<00:03:43.040> busted<00:03:43.490> or<00:03:43.610> broken<00:03:45.700> changed

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
nothing looks busted or broken changed

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.380 
nothing looks busted or broken changed
nice<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.240> tight<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.470> then<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.640> lower<00:03:49.970> chain

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
nice and tight and then the lower chain

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.130 
nice and tight and then the lower chain
timing<00:03:50.870> chain<00:03:51.640> as<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.790> can<00:03:52.940> see<00:03:53.150> goes<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:54.050> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
timing chain as you can see goes on the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.340 
timing chain as you can see goes on the
back<00:03:54.320> spindle<00:03:54.770> here<00:03:55.450> if<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.900> was<00:03:57.020> holding<00:03:57.140> my

camera right alright so it goes on the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.710 
camera right alright so it goes on the
back<00:03:59.000> spindle<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:01.180> swings<00:04:02.180> all<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.450> way<00:04:02.540> down

alright here we go
so<00:04:28.650> my<00:04:29.610> tensioner<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.770> busted<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:32.640> no

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
so my tensioner is busted have no

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.520 
so my tensioner is busted have no
tension<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.240> my<00:04:33.270> chain<00:04:33.540> nice<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.110> loose<00:04:34.290> so

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
tension on my chain nice and loose so

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.710 
tension on my chain nice and loose so
that's<00:04:35.400> where<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.730> loud<00:04:35.910> horrible<00:04:36.330> sound<00:04:36.540> was

that's where the loud horrible sound was
coming<00:04:36.870> from<00:04:38.270> here<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.570> tensioner<00:04:40.200> here's

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
coming from here is the tensioner here's

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.170 
coming from here is the tensioner here's
where<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.070> piston<00:04:41.430> came<00:04:41.610> from<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:41.940> little

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
where that piston came from that little

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.820 
where that piston came from that little
cylinder<00:04:44.870> if<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.200> kind<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.500> see<00:04:46.680> where

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
we'll see get it all cleaned up get all
