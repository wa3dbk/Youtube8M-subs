to be and I think after I gave it a shot

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.730 
to be and I think after I gave it a shot
of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> matte<00:00:23.400> finish<00:00:23.510> it<00:00:24.510> brought<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.109> some

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of the matte finish it brought out some

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
of the matte finish it brought out some
of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> colors<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.519> put<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
of the colors I put on there the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
of the colors I put on there the
weathering<00:00:28.070> intensified<00:00:29.070> him<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.580> bit

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
weathering intensified him a little bit

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.560 
weathering intensified him a little bit
and<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.980> pretty<00:00:31.980> much<00:00:32.070> exactly<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:33.239> I'm

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and this is pretty much exactly what I'm

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
and this is pretty much exactly what I'm
looking<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.649> far<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:34.950> weathering<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
looking for as far as weathering is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
looking for as far as weathering is
concerned<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.649> what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> had<00:00:37.860> previously<00:00:38.129> was

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
concerned just what I had previously was

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.130 
concerned just what I had previously was
just<00:00:38.910> way<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.690> too<00:00:40.079> intense<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.140> much

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just way way too intense so this is much

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
just way way too intense so this is much
more<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> line<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.489> looking<00:00:44.789> for

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
so the second time was a charm so I've

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
so the second time was a charm so I've
got<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> place<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.489> start

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
got this one in place I'm gonna start

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.529 
got this one in place I'm gonna start
working<00:00:52.100> over<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.270> other

working over here and get these other
ones<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.110> place<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:57.379> think<00:00:58.379> before<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
ones in place and think before with the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.590 
ones in place and think before with the
other<00:00:59.760> peers<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:01.460> took<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.670> some

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
other peers I actually took off some

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
other peers I actually took off some
chunk<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> piers<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:05.010> them<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> fit

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
chunk of the piers to get them to fit

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.560 
chunk of the piers to get them to fit
against<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> rock<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.420> time

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
against the rock I think this time

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
against the rock I think this time
around<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.869> gonna<00:01:07.110> carve<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> rock<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
around I'm gonna carve the rock out to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.060 
around I'm gonna carve the rock out to
get<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> fit<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.869> better

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
get this to fit in a little bit better

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.570 
get this to fit in a little bit better
and<00:01:12.080> just<00:01:13.080> give<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> rock<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> touch<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and just give the rock a touch of a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
and just give the rock a touch of a
great<00:01:14.970> pain<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:17.030> nestled

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
great pain because it's gonna be nestled

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
great pain because it's gonna be nestled
up<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.570> against<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> pier

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
up right against the pier

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.490 
up right against the pier
and<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.490> something<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.119> gonna<00:01:21.240> be

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and it's not something that's gonna be

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.390 
and it's not something that's gonna be
visible<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:23.009> visible<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> anybody<00:01:23.700> so
