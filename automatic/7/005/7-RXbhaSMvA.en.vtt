largest aquarium and when we put this

largest aquarium and when we put this
place<00:00:25.770> together<00:00:25.919> we<00:00:26.369> set<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.570> only<00:00:27.779> be

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
place together we set out to not only be

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
place together we set out to not only be
entertaining<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:30.180> feel<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
entertaining we feel you have to
entertain<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.460> also<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.850> be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
entertain first but then also to be

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.200 
entertain first but then also to be
educating<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:35.070> goal<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> basically<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
educating and the goal is basically to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.900 
educating and the goal is basically to
let<00:00:37.110> people<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> aquatic<00:00:38.670> world

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
let people know about the aquatic world

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.639 
let people know about the aquatic world
a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> people<00:00:39.960> don't<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
a lot of people don't have the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.610 
a lot of people don't have the
opportunity<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.280> travel<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> oceans<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
opportunity to travel to the oceans and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160 
opportunity to travel to the oceans and
we're<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.130> landlocked<00:00:44.400> city<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.060> so<00:00:45.720> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
we're in a landlocked city here so the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.800 
we're in a landlocked city here so the
knowledge<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.430> oceans<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.570> less

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
knowledge of the oceans is much less

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.450 
knowledge of the oceans is much less
here<00:00:49.079> than<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.380> would<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> coast<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here than it would be on the coast and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880 
here than it would be on the coast and
so<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.180> need<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.570> bring<00:00:51.989> these<00:00:52.170> animals<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so we need to bring these animals to the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.210 
so we need to bring these animals to the
people<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> show<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:54.470> just<00:00:55.470> what<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> oceans

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
people to show them just what the oceans

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.950 
people to show them just what the oceans
are<00:00:56.310> all<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.060> why<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.570> need<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
are all about and why we need to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
are all about and why we need to
preserve<00:00:58.739> those<00:00:59.130> oceans

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 

the<00:01:09.600> juror<00:01:09.929> crime<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:10.829> largest<00:01:11.189> aquarium

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the juror crime is the largest aquarium

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
the juror crime is the largest aquarium
we<00:01:12.149> have<00:01:12.359> eight<00:01:13.049> million<00:01:13.380> gallons<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.009> water

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
we have eight million gallons of water

about 30 million liters and the what

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.690 
about 30 million liters and the what
sets<00:01:18.569> us<00:01:18.689> aside<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.229> any<00:01:19.469> other<00:01:19.560> aquarium<00:01:19.979> in

sets us aside from any other aquarium in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
sets us aside from any other aquarium in
the<00:01:20.759> world<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.719> exhibit<00:01:22.079> right<00:01:22.229> behind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the world is this exhibit right behind

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880 
the world is this exhibit right behind
me<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> almost<00:01:24.420> 25<00:01:25.020> million<00:01:25.380> liters<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
me which is almost 25 million liters of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270 
me which is almost 25 million liters of
water<00:01:26.039> in<00:01:26.310> itself<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.170> contains<00:01:28.799> four

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
water in itself and it contains four

whale<00:01:29.640> sharks<00:01:30.060> whale<00:01:30.630> sharks<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
whale sharks whale sharks are the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
whale sharks whale sharks are the
largest<00:01:31.380> fish<00:01:31.679> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.459> sea<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.969> in<00:01:33.329> order<00:01:33.539> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
largest fish in the sea and in order to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.910 
largest fish in the sea and in order to
have<00:01:33.780> them<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> build<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have them here we had to build the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.099 
have them here we had to build the
largest<00:01:35.069> exhibit<00:01:35.539> that's<00:01:36.539> ever<00:01:36.689> been<00:01:36.869> built

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
largest exhibit that's ever been built

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.340 
largest exhibit that's ever been built
so<00:01:37.859> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.149> 10<00:01:39.509> meters<00:01:39.810> deep<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so this is about 10 meters deep and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.999 
so this is about 10 meters deep and
almost<00:01:40.890> 100<00:01:41.280> meters<00:01:41.520> long<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.659> 30<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.799> 40

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
almost 100 meters long and 30 or 40

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.870 
almost 100 meters long and 30 or 40
meters<00:01:44.250> wide<00:01:44.459> and<00:01:45.289> in<00:01:46.289> there<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.340> dozens

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
meters wide and in there you have dozens

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
meters wide and in there you have dozens
of different<00:01:48.090> species<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> Georgia

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of different species at the Georgia

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 
of different species at the Georgia
Aquarium<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.849> almost<00:01:51.239> 500<00:01:51.959> different

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
species in 60 different exhibits so when

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.449 
species in 60 different exhibits so when
you<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:58.709> five<00:01:58.950> different
