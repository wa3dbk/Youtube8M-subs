that<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.430> happen<00:00:41.489> especially<00:00:42.300> under<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that will happen especially under a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 
that will happen especially under a
coach<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.739> me<00:00:44.160> highly<00:00:44.489> rich<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:45.059> saw<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.300> 38

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
coach like me highly rich we saw some 38

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
coach like me highly rich we saw some 38
you<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> player<00:00:46.530> had<00:00:47.039> quite<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> big<00:00:47.550> ego<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you got a player had quite a big ego and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
you got a player had quite a big ego and
Samuel<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.719> though<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> he<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.410> sorted

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
Samuel at though and he kind of sorted

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
Samuel at though and he kind of sorted
him<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.480> make<00:00:51.809> sure<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> team

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
him out you know make sure that the team

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
him out you know make sure that the team
didn't<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> fall<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.239> efficiency

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
didn't kind of fall down in efficiency

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
didn't kind of fall down in efficiency
because<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.649> ego<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.190> he<00:00:56.280> handle<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
because it was ego and he handle and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.729 
because it was ego and he handle and
quite<00:00:57.059> well<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.620> will

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
quite well so I don't think that he will

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
quite well so I don't think that he will
be<00:00:58.890> dragging<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> team<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
be dragging the team down and there's a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
be dragging the team down and there's a
lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:00.930> adding<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> cause<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
lot of things adding to the cause that I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
lot of things adding to the cause that I
don't<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.090> case<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
don't think that would be the case as I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840 
don't think that would be the case as I
said<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> free<00:01:04.890> chance<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.309> revive<00:01:05.640> his

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
said it's a free chance to revive his

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
said it's a free chance to revive his
career<00:01:06.030> doesn't<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> starter<00:01:07.890> he

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
career doesn't have to be a starter he

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399
