him besides him being just a janitor at
the<00:00:42.690> Atlas<00:00:43.110> facility<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.100> believe<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.870> if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the Atlas facility I believe so now if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.200 
the Atlas facility I believe so now if
we<00:00:46.079> listen<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.590> quotes<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.129> him<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.969> learn

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
we listen to quotes from him we do learn

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.940 
we listen to quotes from him we do learn
that<00:00:48.510> he<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.140> important<00:00:49.590> than<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that he is more important than just a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
that he is more important than just a
janitor<00:00:50.309> he's<00:00:50.460> been<00:00:50.700> doing<00:00:51.059> stuff<00:00:51.300> his<00:00:51.510> life

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

that<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.500> been<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.890> than<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.520> janitor

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that have been more than just a janitor

that have been more than just a janitor
job<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.260> someone<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.160> from

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

Atlas corporation if you guys are
catching<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.439> believe<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.400> either

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
catching on i believe that he was either

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.570 
catching on i believe that he was either
some<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.150> spy<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.869> something<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.430> with

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
some kind of spy or something to do with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
some kind of spy or something to do with
atlas<00:01:08.970> undercover<00:01:09.600> something<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.680> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
atlas undercover something to do with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.230 
atlas undercover something to do with
that<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.100> sentinel<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.640> don't<00:01:11.820> believe<00:01:12.000> they

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that now sentinel i don't believe they

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
that now sentinel i don't believe they
vary<00:01:12.810> they<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.430> atlas<00:01:14.939> very<00:01:15.210> much

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
vary they are they like atlas very much

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
vary they are they like atlas very much
and<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.650> Sentinel<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> kill<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.909> he's

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and so for Sentinel to kill them he's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.320 
and so for Sentinel to kill them he's
obviously<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> spy<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.590> sentinel<00:01:20.330> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
obviously not a spy for a sentinel so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
obviously not a spy for a sentinel so
he's<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:22.560> advanced<00:01:23.040> into<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
he's probably more advanced into the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.289 
he's probably more advanced into the
realm<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.810> atlas<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> look<00:01:26.759> at

this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> probably<00:02:00.960> where<00:02:01.170> Sentinel<00:02:01.649> was

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this is probably where Sentinel was

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
this is probably where Sentinel was
hanging<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> most<00:02:02.880> part<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.509> even

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
hanging out for the most part so even

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
hanging out for the most part so even
though<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.259> does<00:02:04.469> say<00:02:04.799> Atlas<00:02:05.310> Sentinel<00:02:06.060> steals

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
though it does say Atlas Sentinel steals

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.510 
though it does say Atlas Sentinel steals
things<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:07.170> them<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.619> uses<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.099> that's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
things from them and uses them that's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130 
things from them and uses them that's
confirmed<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.179> Sentinel<00:02:09.720> comes<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
confirmed because Sentinel comes and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
confirmed because Sentinel comes and
picks<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.470> innocent<00:02:11.129> people<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> map

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
picks up innocent people from the map

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.220 
picks up innocent people from the map
infection<00:02:12.720> with

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
infection with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
infection with
warbirds<00:02:13.860> from<00:02:14.159> atlas<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.150> they

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
warbirds from atlas so we know that they

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.020 
warbirds from atlas so we know that they
use<00:02:15.629> their<00:02:15.870> stuff<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.769> why<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.159> kill<00:02:17.430> oz<00:02:17.670> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
use their stuff but why they kill oz is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
use their stuff but why they kill oz is
presumably<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.959> they<00:02:19.440> were<00:02:19.500> looking

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
presumably because they were looking

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
presumably because they were looking
into<00:02:20.129> him<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.760> figured<00:02:21.090> out<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.569> he<00:02:21.599> is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
into him and they figured out that he is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.690 
into him and they figured out that he is
more<00:02:22.140> than<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.409> a<00:02:22.530> janitor<00:02:22.920> he's<00:02:23.129> probably<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
more than just a janitor he's probably a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600 
more than just a janitor he's probably a
spy<00:02:24.000> or<00:02:24.510> something<00:02:24.810> worse<00:02:25.680> than<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
spy or something worse than that and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.369 
spy or something worse than that and
they<00:02:26.970> needed<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.420> three<00:02:27.720> other<00:02:27.900> characters

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
they needed the three other characters

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.050 
they needed the three other characters
for<00:02:28.650> questioning<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:29.549> could<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.819> bring

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
for questioning and they could not bring

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
for questioning and they could not bring
oz<00:02:30.269> because<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.080> they've<00:02:31.260> known<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.650> him

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
oz because of what they've known for him

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.070 
oz because of what they've known for him
or<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.549> they<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.849> about<00:02:32.879> him<00:02:33.180> let<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:33.959> know

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
or what they know about him let me know

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.300 
or what they know about him let me know
what<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> guys<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:34.799> this<00:02:35.040> theory
