00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
we got to really see the real CDC it

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.070 
we got to really see the real CDC it
definitely<00:00:08.580> helped<00:00:08.820> me<00:00:09.000> decide<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> little<00:00:09.929> bit

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
definitely helped me decide a little bit

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.169 
definitely helped me decide a little bit
where<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> want<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> go<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> future<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
where I want to go in a future it's a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.959 
where I want to go in a future it's a
great<00:00:12.360> experience<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.549> honestly<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
great experience and honestly I think it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:24.080 
great experience and honestly I think it
would<00:00:15.089> change<00:00:15.540> someone's<00:00:15.900> life<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:23.090> applied

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
for the disease detective camp because I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.259 
for the disease detective camp because I
was<00:00:26.070> always<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.519> interested<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
what they do and I was really interested

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
what they do and I was really interested
in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> epidemic<00:00:32.160> side<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.239> learn

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
in the epidemic side of it to learn

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
in the epidemic side of it to learn
about<00:00:33.570> outbreaks<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> how<00:00:34.469> they're<00:00:34.680> caused

that<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.930> came<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:09.090> sure

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that I came here because I was not sure

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.429 
that I came here because I was not sure
whether<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.810> interested<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
whether I was interested in

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.859 
whether I was interested in
in<00:01:11.799> medicine<00:01:12.340> or<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.880> public<00:01:13.210> policy<00:01:13.630> part

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
in medicine or the public policy part

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.719 
in medicine or the public policy part
and<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.409> learned<00:01:14.619> that<00:01:14.829> I<00:01:14.890> could<00:01:15.100> combine<00:01:15.429> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
and I learned that I could combine the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.370 
and I learned that I could combine the
two<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:16.119> would<00:01:16.420> say<00:01:16.600> my<00:01:16.719> favorite<00:01:17.020> part<00:01:17.109> of<00:01:17.259> the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
two I would say my favorite part of the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.349 
two I would say my favorite part of the
camp<00:01:17.560> was<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.799> pulse<00:01:18.280> net<00:01:18.490> labs<00:01:18.759> where<00:01:19.060> we<00:01:19.179> got

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
camp was the pulse net labs where we got

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.050 
camp was the pulse net labs where we got
to<00:01:19.569> see<00:01:19.840> what<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.380> biologists<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
to see what the biologists and the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.370 
to see what the biologists and the
chemists<00:01:22.390> get<00:01:22.539> to<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:22.990> lab<00:01:23.109> and<00:01:23.289> they

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
chemists get to do in the lab and they

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.219 
chemists get to do in the lab and they
get<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> work<00:01:23.829> with<00:01:24.179> real<00:01:25.179> viruses<00:01:25.959> and

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
get to work with real viruses and

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.859 
get to work with real viruses and
bacteria<00:01:26.859> and<00:01:27.359> figure<00:01:28.359> out<00:01:28.390> which<00:01:28.659> one

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
bacteria and figure out which one

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.300 
bacteria and figure out which one
matches<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.439> see<00:01:29.560> if<00:01:29.649> it's<00:01:29.799> an<00:01:29.920> outbreak<00:01:30.130> or

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
matches to see if it's an outbreak or

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.959 
matches to see if it's an outbreak or
not<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.829> favorite<00:01:33.130> part<00:01:33.250> was<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.459> Global

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
not my favorite part was the Global

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.639 
not my favorite part was the Global
Health<00:01:34.060> Fair<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:34.689> a<00:01:34.810> great<00:01:34.990> opportunity<00:01:35.560> to

people's<00:01:39.979> lives<00:01:41.439> hearing<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.560> different

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
people's lives hearing the different

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.590 
people's lives hearing the different
speakers<00:01:43.219> I<00:01:43.340> thought<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.060> was<00:01:44.149> my<00:01:44.299> favorite

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
speakers I thought that was my favorite

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.300 
speakers I thought that was my favorite
part<00:01:44.749> to<00:01:45.020> hear<00:01:45.229> like<00:01:45.469> people<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:46.159> were

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
part to hear like people that were

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.740 
part to hear like people that were
actually<00:01:46.789> involved<00:01:46.999> with<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> smallpox

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
actually involved with the smallpox

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.630 
actually involved with the smallpox
eradication<00:01:48.289> I<00:01:48.979> mean<00:01:49.219> that's<00:01:49.399> just<00:01:49.549> amazing

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
eradication I mean that's just amazing

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.209 
eradication I mean that's just amazing
to<00:01:50.179> be<00:01:50.210> able<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.509> hear<00:01:50.780> them<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.799> see<00:01:52.069> them

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
to be able to hear them and to see them

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.399 
to be able to hear them and to see them
like<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.520> person<00:01:53.060> my<00:01:53.780> favorite<00:01:54.109> part<00:01:54.319> was

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
like in person my favorite part was

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.899 
like in person my favorite part was
actually<00:01:54.829> trying<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.520> hazardous

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
actually trying on the hazardous

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.609 
actually trying on the hazardous
materials<00:01:56.450> suit<00:01:56.689> it's<00:01:57.020> actually<00:01:57.289> harder<00:01:57.590> to

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
materials suit it's actually harder to
