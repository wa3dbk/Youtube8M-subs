00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
with dead cold all I have to do is pump
the<00:02:15.010> gas<00:02:15.160> pedal<00:02:15.400> twice<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.480> tear<00:02:17.140> over<00:02:17.350> inches

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.500 

as<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.230> see<00:02:39.500> all<00:02:39.970> right<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.300> turn

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
as you can see all right to do is turn

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.100 
as you can see all right to do is turn
the<00:02:41.660> key<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.010> keep<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.130> one<00:02:43.280> little<00:02:43.990> pump<00:02:44.990> on

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
the key and keep it one little pump on

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.070 
the key and keep it one little pump on
the<00:02:45.200> panel<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:47.390> know<00:02:47.480> right<00:02:47.690> now<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:47.930> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the panel and you know right now it's a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.510 
the panel and you know right now it's a
little<00:02:48.560> bit<00:02:48.650> higher<00:02:48.830> than<00:02:49.069> normal<00:02:49.190> because

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
little bit higher than normal because

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.840 
little bit higher than normal because
it's<00:02:49.880> old<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.680> has<00:02:51.680> no<00:02:52.010> problems<00:02:52.580> like<00:02:52.760> I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's old but has no problems like I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.970 
it's old but has no problems like I
started<00:02:53.180> sitting<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:54.140> couple<00:02:54.590> weeks<00:02:54.620> or

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
started sitting for a couple weeks or

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980 
started sitting for a couple weeks or
several<00:02:55.070> months<00:02:55.550> pump<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> gas<00:02:56.270> pedal<00:02:56.600> turn

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
several months pump the gas pedal turn

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.059 
several months pump the gas pedal turn
the<00:02:57.080> key<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.650> where<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> go

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.920 

well<00:03:02.579> let's<00:03:03.120> take<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.329> look<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.689> the<00:03:03.780> engine

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
well let's take a look at the engine

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:27.460 
well let's take a look at the engine
right<00:03:04.170> now<00:03:04.319> we're<00:03:04.530> joining

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.619 

so<00:03:28.470> as<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.860> see<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.300> probably<00:03:30.300> well<00:03:30.420> like

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
so as you can see it probably well like

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.750 
so as you can see it probably well like
I<00:03:30.750> said<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.989> usually<00:03:31.500> will<00:03:32.250> drive<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.489> about

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
I said I usually will drive it about

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.160 
I said I usually will drive it about
2,000<00:03:33.330> miles<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.629> year<00:03:35.599> come<00:03:36.599> in<00:03:36.720> here<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.050> take

information I have is it is still a

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.680 
information I have is it is still a
single<00:04:46.380> port<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:47.190> probably<00:04:47.520> has<00:04:47.580> about<00:04:47.789> 15,000

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690

miles<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:49.139> it<00:04:49.169> I'm<00:04:50.039> like<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.460> said<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.820> runs

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
miles on it I'm like I said it runs

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.879 
miles on it I'm like I said it runs
beautifully<00:04:51.419> it<00:04:51.990> leaks<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.320> little<00:04:52.470> bit<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.770> oil
