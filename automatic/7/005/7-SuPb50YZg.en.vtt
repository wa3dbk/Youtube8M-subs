00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
from below I wasn't sure if it was

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.400 
from below I wasn't sure if it was
possible<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.940> lot<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.300> rock<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.050> totally

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
possible a lot of rock is just totally

it<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> had<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.319> kind<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:43.100> investigate<00:02:43.760> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it so I had to kind of investigate to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.960 
it so I had to kind of investigate to
see<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:44.600> there<00:02:44.870> was<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:45.590> hand<00:02:46.280> holds<00:02:46.790> him

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
see if there was actually hand holds him

or four of the hardest routes in the

or four of the hardest routes in the

world on top of each other without any
rest<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.790> way<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.360> looks<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.959> mean<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
rest the way that it looks I mean it

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.940 
rest the way that it looks I mean it
looks<00:03:07.760> impossible<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:09.050> know<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.739> looks

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
looks impossible you know it looks

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.910 
looks impossible you know it looks
impossible

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.339 

when<00:03:14.580> my<00:03:14.730> feet<00:03:14.910> leave<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.120> ground<00:03:15.349> it's

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
when my feet leave the ground it's

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.350 
when my feet leave the ground it's
basically<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.950> race<00:03:17.610> against<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> clock<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
basically a race against the clock to

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:41.390 
basically a race against the clock to
get<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.870> top<00:03:39.260> there's<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.350> sequence<00:03:41.220> where

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
get your top there's a sequence where

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.229 
get your top there's a sequence where
you<00:03:41.519> take<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.209> finger<00:03:42.540> pocket<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
you take this one finger pocket just to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.000 
you take this one finger pocket just to
figure<00:03:48.450> out<00:03:48.630> those<00:03:48.810> two<00:03:49.050> loops<00:03:49.319> it's<00:03:49.739> been

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
figure out those two loops it's been

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:02.940 
figure out those two loops it's been
several<00:03:50.250> days

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.770

this route did chris is working on up

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.009 
this route did chris is working on up
here<00:04:06.200> there's<00:04:06.890> nothing<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.280> compare<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.670> to

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
here there's nothing to compare it to

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.259 
here there's nothing to compare it to
it's<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.409> think<00:04:10.069> that<00:04:10.159> it<00:04:10.280> down<00:04:10.549> far<00:04:10.879> beyond

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
it's I think that it down far beyond

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:52.960 
it's I think that it down far beyond
what<00:04:11.599> has<00:04:11.870> ever<00:04:12.049> been<00:04:12.230> done<00:04:12.260> before<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:52.580> see<00:04:52.789> if

what has ever been done before to see if

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.939
