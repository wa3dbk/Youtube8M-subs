00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.539 
alright today I'm going to tell you
about<00:00:11.150> tardigrades<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
about tardigrades but first I want to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.689 
about tardigrades but first I want to
ask<00:00:14.609> you<00:00:14.789> a<00:00:14.850> question<00:00:15.180> so<00:00:16.220> what<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.520> think

ask you a question so what do you think
the<00:00:17.760> hardiest<00:00:18.029> animal<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.689> I<00:00:19.699> bet<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.730> have

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the hardiest animal is I bet you have

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
the hardiest animal is I bet you have
some<00:00:21.210> animals<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.230> your<00:00:22.260> mind<00:00:22.530> now<00:00:22.770> maybe<00:00:23.039> like

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
some animals in your mind now maybe like

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.960 
some animals in your mind now maybe like
the<00:00:23.640> those<00:00:24.000> giant<00:00:24.480> turtles<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:26.130> adds<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the those giant turtles that adds that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.930 
the those giant turtles that adds that
of<00:00:27.119> shells<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.140> mean<00:00:28.350> those<00:00:28.920> look<00:00:29.130> tough<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
of shells I mean those look tough but I

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.450 
of shells I mean those look tough but I
have<00:00:30.720> thought<00:00:31.020> I<00:00:31.350> can<00:00:31.710> tell<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.039> that<00:00:32.189> slowing

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have thought I can tell you that slowing

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.080 
have thought I can tell you that slowing
that's<00:00:32.789> even<00:00:33.270> harder<00:00:34.489> it's<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.940> little

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that's even harder it's this little

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.029 
that's even harder it's this little
fellow<00:00:36.420> ate<00:00:36.690> them<00:00:36.930> he's<00:00:37.379> called<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.890> called

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
fellow ate them he's called it's called

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.149 
fellow ate them he's called it's called
the<00:00:38.250> tardigrade<00:00:38.909> and<00:00:40.039> it<00:00:41.039> is<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:42.300> looks<00:00:42.510> really

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
the tardigrade and it is it looks really

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.840 
the tardigrade and it is it looks really
not<00:00:44.159> party<00:00:44.909> it's<00:00:45.749> like<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.699> looks<00:00:47.699> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
not party it's like it just looks like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
not party it's like it just looks like
you<00:00:48.659> could<00:00:48.839> squish<00:00:49.139> it<00:00:49.319> easily<00:00:49.889> but<00:00:50.100> these

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
you could squish it easily but these

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.629 
you could squish it easily but these
guys<00:00:50.639> are<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.089> amazingly<00:00:51.600> tough

tardigrades<00:00:53.639> can<00:00:53.999> survive<00:00:54.359> things<00:00:55.109> like<00:00:55.409> them

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
tardigrades can survive things like them

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.189

freezing<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.190> thawing<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.479> own

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
freezing and thawing which would own

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.110

normally that would that would rupture
someone's<00:01:12.120> cells<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.230> that<00:01:13.620> would<00:01:13.770> kill<00:01:14.370> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
someone's cells and that would kill the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
someone's cells and that would kill the
cells<00:01:14.730> which<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.360> kill<00:01:15.660> them<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.160> also

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
cells which would kill them it can also

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.600 
cells which would kill them it can also
survive<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:18.530> very<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.800> very<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.310> oxygen

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
survive a very with very little oxygen

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.830 
survive a very with very little oxygen
it<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:22.320> survive<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.700> water<00:01:24.060> it

it can survive with very little water it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
it can survive with very little water it
can<00:01:25.320> search<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.040> survive<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can search it can also survive a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.400 
can search it can also survive a
thousand<00:01:27.360> times<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.780> radiation<00:01:28.200> than

thousand times more radiation than
humans<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.950> another<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.910> can<00:01:33.060> also

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
humans and another thing is it can also

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.380 
humans and another thing is it can also
survive<00:01:33.830> some<00:01:34.830> noxious<00:01:35.280> chemicals<00:01:36.150> which

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
survive some noxious chemicals which

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390 
survive some noxious chemicals which
would<00:01:37.340> normally<00:01:38.780> suit<00:01:39.780> injure<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.530> kill<00:01:40.560> an

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
organism it it can survive boiling

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810 
organism it it can survive boiling
alcohol<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.090> vacuum<00:01:45.480> of<00:01:45.540> space<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.400> also<00:01:47.400> six

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
alcohol the vacuum of space and also six

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960 
alcohol the vacuum of space and also six
times<00:01:48.300> more<00:01:48.480> pressure<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.980> found<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
times more pressure than is found in the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.180 
times more pressure than is found in the
Marianas<00:01:51.480> Trench<00:01:51.690> which<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.380> deepest

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
Marianas Trench which is the deepest

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.580 
Marianas Trench which is the deepest
place<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.150> ocean<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> pressure<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
place in the ocean and that pressure is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.330 
place in the ocean and that pressure is
pretty<00:01:55.890> extreme<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:57.150> um<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> you're<00:01:59.220> probably

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pretty extreme and um so you're probably

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.050 
pretty extreme and um so you're probably
wondering<00:01:59.840> how<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.900> they<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.940> be

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
wondering how do they do this to be

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
wondering how do they do this to be
honest<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:04.260> don't<00:02:04.440> really<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.610> are

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
honest we don't really know they are

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.469 
honest we don't really know they are
it's<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:07.080> mysterious<00:02:07.530> thing<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.800> basically

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
it's this mysterious thing and basically

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's this mysterious thing and basically
from<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.229> basic<00:02:10.590> what

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
from what we know what they basic what

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.869 
from what we know what they basic what
it<00:02:10.950> looks<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.370> doing<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:11.760> they

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it looks like they're doing is they

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.920 
it looks like they're doing is they
basically<00:02:12.440> pull<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:14.510> four<00:02:15.510> pairs<00:02:15.840> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
basically pull in there four pairs of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.899 
basically pull in there four pairs of
stubby<00:02:16.469> little<00:02:16.590> legs<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.219> then<00:02:17.760> they

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
stubby little legs and then they

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.830 
stubby little legs and then they
temporarily<00:02:18.299> kill<00:02:18.930> themselves

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
temporarily kill themselves

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.040 
temporarily kill themselves
and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:21.519> conditions<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.450> nice<00:02:22.660> again

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
and then when conditions get nice again

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.369 
and then when conditions get nice again
they<00:02:23.970> unkilled<00:02:24.970> themselves<00:02:25.540> they<00:02:25.690> come<00:02:26.230> back

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
they unkilled themselves they come back

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.320 
they unkilled themselves they come back
to<00:02:26.530> life<00:02:26.680> magically<00:02:27.310> well<00:02:27.459> not<00:02:27.670> magically<00:02:28.180> we

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
to life magically well not magically we

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.820 
to life magically well not magically we
we<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:28.930> don't<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.349> how<00:02:29.500> yet<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:30.010> um

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
we just don't know how yet but um

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
we just don't know how yet but um
scientists<00:02:32.830> you're<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:33.489> wondering<00:02:33.910> how

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
scientists you're probably wondering how

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.000 
scientists you're probably wondering how
did<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:34.989> know<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.500> survive<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
did they know that it can survive the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.970 
did they know that it can survive the
vacuum<00:02:36.129> of<00:02:36.370> space<00:02:36.430> well<00:02:36.879> they<00:02:37.360> do<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.920> that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
vacuum of space well they do think that

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.589 
vacuum of space well they do think that
you<00:02:39.099> would<00:02:39.220> think<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.519> they<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:40.060> take

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
you would think that they do they take

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.089 
you would think that they do they take
these<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.989> guys<00:02:41.110> put<00:02:41.440> them<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> rocket

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
these little guys put them in a rocket

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.009 
these little guys put them in a rocket
and<00:02:42.220> launch<00:02:42.519> them<00:02:42.640> into<00:02:42.700> space<00:02:43.120> expose<00:02:43.840> them

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
and launch them into space expose them

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.890 
and launch them into space expose them
to<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.470> vacuum<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.950> space<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.489> 10<00:02:45.790> days<00:02:46.060> then

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
to the vacuum of space for 10 days then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.890 
to the vacuum of space for 10 days then
brought<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.560> down<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.010> earth<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
brought them back down to earth and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.150 
brought them back down to earth and
tardigrades<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.170> oh<00:02:50.319> hi<00:02:50.560> how<00:02:50.890> are<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
tardigrades are like oh hi how are you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.729 
tardigrades are like oh hi how are you
and<00:02:51.840> apparently<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:52.959> also<00:02:53.110> made<00:02:53.380> some<00:02:53.500> baby

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
and apparently they also made some baby

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.039 
and apparently they also made some baby
tardigrades<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.670> they<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.239> space<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.019> no

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
tardigrades so they can space is no

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.170 
tardigrades so they can space is no
problem<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:56.709> them<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:58.380> they<00:02:59.380> are<00:02:59.650> just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
problem for them they they are just

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
problem for them they they are just
really<00:03:01.180> amazing<00:03:01.870> at<00:03:02.470> how<00:03:02.860> Hardy<00:03:03.579> they<00:03:03.760> are<00:03:03.940> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
really amazing at how Hardy they are and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.869 
really amazing at how Hardy they are and
they<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.739> some<00:03:05.950> other<00:03:06.129> names<00:03:06.370> they're<00:03:06.670> also

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
they have some other names they're also

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.479 
they have some other names they're also
known<00:03:07.329> as<00:03:07.660> they're<00:03:07.989> known<00:03:08.200> as<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.470> water<00:03:09.160> bears

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
known as they're known as a water bears

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.990 
known as they're known as a water bears
or<00:03:10.920> moss<00:03:11.920> pigs<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.519> think<00:03:12.790> um<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
or moss pigs I think um and they the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.089 
or moss pigs I think um and they the
water<00:03:16.269> bears<00:03:16.569> wise<00:03:16.750> comes<00:03:17.470> from<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> fact

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
water bears wise comes from the fact

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.759 
water bears wise comes from the fact
that<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:18.430> usually<00:03:18.849> are<00:03:19.209> found<00:03:19.420> in<00:03:19.599> water<00:03:19.930> um

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that they usually are found in water um

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.699 
that they usually are found in water um
and<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.810> reason<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.079> they're<00:03:23.319> also<00:03:23.470> called

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
and the reason that they're also called

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.490 
and the reason that they're also called
moss<00:03:24.010> pigs<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.609> because<00:03:25.000> they're<00:03:25.959> what<00:03:26.380> they

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
moss pigs is because they're what they

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.770 
moss pigs is because they're what they
what<00:03:26.859> they<00:03:26.889> do<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.250> eat<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.700> they<00:03:27.970> um<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.480> they

what they do to eat is they um is they
actually<00:03:28.930> eat<00:03:29.290> moss<00:03:29.739> they<00:03:30.209> basically<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.540> one

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
actually eat moss they basically is one

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.720 
actually eat moss they basically is one
of<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.230> few<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:33.010> things<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.280> they<00:03:33.430> do<00:03:33.489> in

disability I mean thank goodness they
aren't<00:03:48.639> a<00:03:48.730> predator<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.209> mean<00:03:49.480> one<00:03:49.989> species<00:03:50.260> is

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
aren't a predator I mean one species is

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.229 
aren't a predator I mean one species is
predatory<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.250> I'm<00:03:51.370> but<00:03:51.639> it<00:03:51.730> only<00:03:51.849> eats<00:03:52.000> a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
predatory but I'm but it only eats a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.839 
predatory but I'm but it only eats a
bacteria<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.829> good<00:03:54.069> because<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.609> it<00:03:54.730> ate

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
bacteria which is good because if it ate

one in it and I'm pretty sure

one in it and I'm pretty sure
considering<00:04:16.090> how<00:04:16.359> hearty<00:04:16.690> those<00:04:16.900> treads<00:04:17.410> were

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
considering how hearty those treads were

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.300 
considering how hearty those treads were
that<00:04:17.709> they<00:04:17.829> were<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:18.220> okay<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:21.220> you're

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
that they were a okay now you're

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.710 
that they were a okay now you're
probably<00:04:21.400> wondering<00:04:21.789> how<00:04:21.880> small<00:04:22.150> are<00:04:22.419> these

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
probably wondering how small are these

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.290 
probably wondering how small are these
things<00:04:22.990> they're<00:04:23.229> about<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:24.700> biggest<00:04:24.910> ones

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
things they're about the biggest ones

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.180 
things they're about the biggest ones
are<00:04:25.450> like<00:04:25.479> one<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.020> half<00:04:26.050> millimeters<00:04:26.830> but

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
are like one and a half millimeters but

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.459 
are like one and a half millimeters but
they're<00:04:27.340> usually<00:04:27.520> about<00:04:28.030> half<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.050> millimeter

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
they're usually about half a millimeter

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.510 
they're usually about half a millimeter
in<00:04:29.740> length<00:04:29.800> there

quite<00:04:31.330> small<00:04:31.629> so<00:04:31.930> I'm<00:04:32.590> despite<00:04:33.580> their<00:04:33.759> size

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
quite small so I'm despite their size

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.260 
quite small so I'm despite their size
and<00:04:34.360> their<00:04:34.560> slowness<00:04:35.729> they<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:37.000> survive

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
and their slowness they can survive

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.610 
and their slowness they can survive
pretty<00:04:37.509> much<00:04:37.690> anywhere<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.229> supports

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
pretty much anywhere and that supports

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.499 
pretty much anywhere and that supports
this<00:04:38.680> an<00:04:38.860> interesting<00:04:39.400> theory<00:04:39.699> that<00:04:39.940> says

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
this an interesting theory that says

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.260 
this an interesting theory that says
that<00:04:40.780> maybe<00:04:41.229> life<00:04:41.590> was<00:04:41.979> didn't<00:04:42.610> originate<00:04:43.210> on

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
that maybe life was didn't originate on

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.240 
that maybe life was didn't originate on
earth<00:04:43.389> but<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.289> originated<00:04:44.830> on<00:04:44.979> another

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
earth but that it originated on another

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.740 
earth but that it originated on another
planet<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:46.060> planet<00:04:46.389> had<00:04:46.479> sometimes

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
planet that planet had sometimes

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.779 
planet that planet had sometimes
disaster<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.740> was<00:04:47.860> blown<00:04:48.250> apart<00:04:48.400> in

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
disaster and it was blown apart in

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.550 
disaster and it was blown apart in
little<00:04:49.090> Hardy<00:04:49.479> little<00:04:49.720> creatures<00:04:50.110> like<00:04:50.259> this

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
little Hardy little creatures like this

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.770 
little Hardy little creatures like this
like<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.220> tardigrade<00:04:51.900> also<00:04:52.900> known<00:04:53.050> as<00:04:53.289> a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
like the tardigrade also known as a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.529 
like the tardigrade also known as a
extrema<00:04:55.780> flight<00:04:56.110> something<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:56.949> that<00:04:57.539> I'm

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
extrema flight something like that I'm

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.270 
extrema flight something like that I'm
not<00:04:58.750> good<00:04:58.900> with<00:04:58.930> pronunciations<00:04:59.770> but<00:05:00.009> that's

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
not good with pronunciations but that's

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.939 
not good with pronunciations but that's
the<00:05:00.430> best<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.699> can<00:05:00.759> pronounce<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.560> they<00:05:02.560> would

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
the best I can pronounce it they would

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.820 
the best I can pronounce it they would
they<00:05:03.310> would<00:05:03.340> own<00:05:03.849> literally<00:05:04.810> they<00:05:05.349> they<00:05:05.650> would

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
they would own literally they they would

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.350 
they would own literally they they would
just<00:05:05.860> be<00:05:06.130> stuck<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.490> these<00:05:06.610> little<00:05:06.729> asteroids

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
just be stuck on these little asteroids

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.899 
just be stuck on these little asteroids
and<00:05:07.479> just<00:05:07.810> go<00:05:08.080> into<00:05:08.289> their<00:05:08.440> little<00:05:08.699> dead<00:05:09.699> it

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
and just go into their little dead it

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.439 
and just go into their little dead it
state<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.630> then<00:05:11.220> hit<00:05:12.220> earth<00:05:12.370> you're<00:05:13.300> all

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
state and then hit earth you're all

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.390 
state and then hit earth you're all
better<00:05:13.630> then<00:05:14.020> they<00:05:14.229> go<00:05:14.740> out<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:14.889> their<00:05:15.039> dead

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
better then they go out of their dead

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.399 
better then they go out of their dead
state<00:05:15.759> so<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:16.599> they<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:16.930> then<00:05:17.289> they<00:05:17.380> just

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
state so that they and then they just

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.950 
state so that they and then they just
colonize<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.159> earth<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.550> evolve<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.180> so

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
colonize the earth and evolve and so

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.990 
colonize the earth and evolve and so
this<00:05:20.319> is<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:22.120> an<00:05:22.240> interesting<00:05:22.690> theory<00:05:22.960> and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
this is that's an interesting theory and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.300 
this is that's an interesting theory and
who<00:05:25.000> knows<00:05:25.180> we<00:05:25.360> might<00:05:25.509> prove<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.870> someday<00:05:26.310> so

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
who knows we might prove it someday so

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.750 
who knows we might prove it someday so
I'm<00:05:27.520> thanks<00:05:28.120> for<00:05:28.240> watching<00:05:28.599> bye
