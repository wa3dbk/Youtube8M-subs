sorry<00:00:01.140> Mamie

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.410 

you've<00:00:04.770> been<00:00:04.920> another<00:00:05.250> hospital<00:00:05.520> ally<00:00:06.029> right

you've been another hospital ally right

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.379 
you've been another hospital ally right
I<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:07.170> got<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:08.189> from<00:00:08.460> there<00:00:08.639> maybe<00:00:09.090> about

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
I just got that from there maybe about

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.299 
I just got that from there maybe about
two<00:00:09.719> weeks<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.769> something<00:00:11.099> called

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
two weeks and you have something called

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.340 
two weeks and you have something called
pulmonary<00:00:12.200> something<00:00:13.820> hypertension<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
pulmonary something hypertension and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
pulmonary something hypertension and
does<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.470> mean<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.800> your<00:00:16.949> blood<00:00:17.130> your

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
does that mean like your blood your

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.120 
does that mean like your blood your
blood<00:00:17.760> vessels<00:00:18.270> are<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.480> little<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.750> smaller

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
blood vessels are a little bit smaller

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.620 
blood vessels are a little bit smaller
right<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.760> harder<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> blood

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
right and so it's harder for the blood

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.939 
right and so it's harder for the blood
to<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.840> turned<00:00:22.080> air<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.529> kind<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> gets

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to get turned air so it kind of gets

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.769 
to get turned air so it kind of gets
packed<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.640> there<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> doctor<00:00:25.199> too

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you didn't think that was possible with

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.400 
you didn't think that was possible with
her<00:02:02.940> because<00:02:03.720> she's<00:02:03.870> always<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.230> good<00:02:04.350> mood
