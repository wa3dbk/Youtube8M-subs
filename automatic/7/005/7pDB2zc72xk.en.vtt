get<00:01:30.790> at<00:01:30.940> from<00:01:31.210> just<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.450> guitar<00:01:31.750> which<00:01:31.960> i

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
get at from just the guitar which i

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.860 
get at from just the guitar which i
think<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.619> higher<00:01:32.800> end<00:01:32.950> models<00:01:33.250> do<00:01:33.460> as<00:01:33.580> well

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870
