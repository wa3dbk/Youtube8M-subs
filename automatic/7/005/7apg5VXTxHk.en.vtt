00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.829
 the market changed a few years ago 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.380
 it was mainly the operators 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.109
 who bought locomotives 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.009
 to evolve towards a segmentation of the 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.310
 market the bonus to 2 comes back to win back the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.680
 European freight market we are 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.539
 repositioned with a locomotive is a 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 major power 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.070
 adaptable to the needs of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.030
 different operators and in function 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.160
 different traffics 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.100
 it is the taking into account of news 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.350
 standards that make it possible to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.879
 move the machine in different countries 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.339
 as we use subsets 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.829
 that are used on other materials 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.109
 and who are so perfectly and find 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.730
 we get an improvement in 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.899
 product quality and gets one 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.699
 greater reliability a greater 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.949
 material availability by a 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.290
 platform that allows to have for a 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.290
 given client based on these 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.360
 options he defined a process his 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.220
 fast for 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.650
 make the locomotive and thus have 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.110
 directly since everything was already ready 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.730
 to study near to nice realized a time 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.000
 of locomotive achievement the most 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.000
 reduced possible 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.940
 riner n 2 it's a devolution project 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.010
 of the passage of a second generation 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.330
 of the range of prima locomotives and on 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.250
 which today we must bring a 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.900
 number of improvements for 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.510
 meet the needs of the market in term 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.010
 of 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.810
 upgrade on their space and 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.640
 normative 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.939
 response to customer needs in 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.560
 terms of changes of two types of 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.210
 customers with the appearance of operators 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.840
 private and then optimization of services 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.369
 Related 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.470
 the major developments concern 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.420
 the use of new systems 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.429
 developed within alstom transport 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.769
 in particular the range of modules of the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.950
 range of onyx modules the modules of 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.660
 power for large equipment 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.580
 speed and the lokomotiv of strong 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.800
 power 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.849
 the integration of the new system 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.090
 of electronics with the new 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.220
 tsm platform is used platform 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.140
 also for the high speed on the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.260
 embarrass the older generation be limited 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.330
 around 4.2 megawatts today on 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 rises to 6 points 4 megawatts which is 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.690
 still significant and starts 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.819
 largely at the level of trust we have 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.080
 greatly increased the power of 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.239
 recovery braking so 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.480
 today we recover exactly the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.640
 even 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.739
 the same power that we generate between 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.299
 action one has a complete optimization of the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.700
 energy consumption system 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.830
 built this locomotive prima alley 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.560
 2 will be one of the first materials 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.859
 equipped with total integration of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.260
 the rtm is on the desk so a 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.660
 optimizing the number of screens one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.420
 simplification of controls nuggets 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.160
 and then after 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.360
 many evolutions linked to the returns 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520
 of experiences ten years back 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750
 experience on the first generation 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.910
 now has integrated very very 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.440
 upstream during the design phase in order to 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.500
 meet three goals the first 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.569
 which is the predictive maintenance the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.220
 second preventive maintenance 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.470
 the third corrective maintenance 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.510
 we must see that the stakes today 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.330
 are ambitious we are being asked a rate 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.209
 of the order of 98% 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.250
 or more and an incident rate 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.769
 very very low exploitation so 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.510
 for that we must be the most reactive 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.910
 possible during incidents so 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.750
 use of tracer tool 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.550
 standard lotus alstom was implemented on 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.520
 7 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.350
 new generation of locomotive 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.760
 allows us to anticipate the needs in 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.280
 term of 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.989
 doughty and material upon arrival 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.250
 of the locomotive in gap deposit with 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.870
 this new generation of komotini 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.700
 will be meaningful and will allow 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.180
 to respond to new expectations 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.180
 of the market 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.669
 so for over three years 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.710
 now alstom has integrated into his 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.530
 organization 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.650
 a design design department 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.100
 stalin whose three major goals 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.690
 are mainly the identity how 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.669
 make the aston brand the most visible 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.220
 possible but never at the expense of 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.990
 the identity expression of the operator 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.130
 client 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.010
 how to improve the attractiveness 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.580
 how to give more attractiveness in 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.040
 our products 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.310
 and then the last one that is not the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.169
 the less it is to ensure the process of 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.510
 design from the beginning ie the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.450
 first sketch do it by hand until 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.760
 vehicle product delivery at 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.620
 the customer and we are today the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.620
 only railway constructor to have 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.240
 an integrated organization internally 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.889
 actually able to cover the whole 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.100
 Product lines of the range 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.810
 alstom from tramway metro to train to 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.350
 high speed going through the 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.380
 locomotives 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.830
 so we worked from 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.050
 three major axes the first is 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.539
 how to express the power and the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.289
 power it was rather expressed in 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.810
 playing especially on the proportions the 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.330
 proportions 1 including for example of 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.100
 the glass surface of the windshield 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.010
 proportions of the front face compared 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.860
 face to face terral we tried 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.270
 to work the performance how 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.760
 express there too so this performance 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.639
 and the performance that goes on that has a lot 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.830
 passed by inclination including the 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.479
 phase of the front face of the lines 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.979
 major in fact the facade 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.479
 and then how to express the 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.210
 reliability and reliability 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.630
 it is above all the expression of quality 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.220
 perceived 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.770
 perceived quality ie by 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.360
 example the docking the detail da and the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.539
 parts one 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.280
 among others the design at the level of 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.819
 the cabin at the cabin of 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.240
 conduct was treated in such a way as to 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.639
 improve the comfort the comfort of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.719
 driver is also in such a way to 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.900
 improve security 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.610
 we treated it with ergonomists and we 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.830
 also makes sure that this interior 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.199
 is sufficiently rewarding also for 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.960
 the for driving the side face 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.819
 very very smooth it's a must 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.919
 that we set ourselves from the start so 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.789
 to improve the expression of identity 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.340
 visual of the operator leave him the 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:47.449
 plus the greatest expression possible 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.250
 on the sides of the locomotive so 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.240
 that they can customize it the 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.240
 most effective way possible
