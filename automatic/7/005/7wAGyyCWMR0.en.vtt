all right we have a whirlpool top load
washer<00:00:22.640> here<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.750> complaint<00:00:24.110> is<00:00:24.320> that

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
washer here and the complaint is that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.249 
washer here and the complaint is that
it's<00:00:24.800> not<00:00:25.009> spinning<00:00:25.400> or<00:00:25.790> draining<00:00:26.270> we<00:00:27.080> just

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
it's not spinning or draining we just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.159 
it's not spinning or draining we just
put<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.380> little<00:00:27.529> water<00:00:27.770> into<00:00:28.009> here<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.110> put<00:00:30.110> it

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
put a little water into here and put it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.480 
put a little water into here and put it
into<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.349> spin<00:00:30.560> cycle<00:00:30.770> does<00:00:31.099> seem<00:00:31.279> to<00:00:31.400> be

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
into a spin cycle does seem to be

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.740 
into a spin cycle does seem to be
draining<00:00:31.820> but<00:00:32.090> we're<00:00:32.300> not<00:00:32.419> getting<00:00:32.540> any

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
draining but we're not getting any

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.140 
draining but we're not getting any
movement<00:00:32.930> out<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.829> basket<00:00:34.310> at<00:00:34.430> all<00:00:34.550> we<00:00:35.030> can

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
movement out of the basket at all we can

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.870 
movement out of the basket at all we can
hear<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.390> motor<00:00:35.600> run<00:00:35.900> when<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:36.230> turn<00:00:36.470> it<00:00:36.620> on

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
hear the motor run when we turn it on

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.270 
hear the motor run when we turn it on
we'll<00:00:37.880> go<00:00:37.970> ahead<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.680> put<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.770> on<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.010> spin

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
we'll go ahead and put it on to a spin

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.440 
we'll go ahead and put it on to a spin
cycle<00:00:40.490> here<00:00:41.380> so<00:00:42.380> everything<00:00:43.010> sounds<00:00:43.430> normal

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
cycle here so everything sounds normal

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.660 
cycle here so everything sounds normal
sounds<00:00:45.110> like<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:45.380> running<00:00:45.560> motor<00:00:46.490> is

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
sounds like it's running motor is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.380 
sounds like it's running motor is
definitely<00:00:47.150> running<00:00:47.330> at<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.320> point<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:50.240> it

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
definitely running at this point and it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.240 
definitely running at this point and it
does<00:00:50.540> drain<00:00:50.810> the<00:00:50.960> water<00:00:51.080> out<00:00:51.260> we<00:00:51.770> open<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.130> up

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
does drain the water out we open it up

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.600 
does drain the water out we open it up
here

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
here

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.370 
here
there's<00:00:53.060> just<00:00:53.210> no<00:00:53.390> movement<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:53.930> basket

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
there's just no movement in the basket

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.110 
there's just no movement in the basket
at<00:00:54.500> all<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.010> what<00:00:55.880> we<00:00:55.970> need<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.210> do<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:58.120> tip

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
at all so what we need to do then is tip

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.460 
at all so what we need to do then is tip
this<00:00:59.300> back<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.750> get<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.900> look<00:01:00.080> at<00:01:00.200> underneath

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
this back and get a look at underneath

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.980 
this back and get a look at underneath
there<00:01:00.860> underneath<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.850> see<00:01:02.120> what's<00:01:02.750> going

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
there underneath it to see what's going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.899 
there underneath it to see what's going
on<00:01:03.140> why<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:03.530> not<00:01:03.680> spinning<00:01:03.980> alright<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:04.759> now

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
on why it's not spinning alright so now

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.550 
on why it's not spinning alright so now
we're<00:01:05.089> underneath<00:01:05.479> our<00:01:05.720> washer<00:01:06.110> here<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
we're underneath our washer here and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.850 
we're underneath our washer here and
what<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.070> have<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.090> our<00:01:08.240> motor<00:01:08.860> we

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
what we have is this is our motor we

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.440 
what we have is this is our motor we
have<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.130> pump<00:01:10.340> on<00:01:10.640> one<00:01:10.880> side<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.270> motor

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
have the pump on one side of the motor

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450 
have the pump on one side of the motor
the<00:01:12.079> motor<00:01:12.380> shaft<00:01:12.710> goes<00:01:12.950> through<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.249> pump

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
the motor shaft goes through the pump

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.609 
the motor shaft goes through the pump
drive<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.909> pump<00:01:14.149> so<00:01:14.509> we<00:01:14.630> know<00:01:14.780> our<00:01:15.409> motor

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
drive to the pump so we know our motor

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.289 
drive to the pump so we know our motor
is<00:01:15.740> running<00:01:16.249> and<00:01:16.429> is<00:01:16.549> draining<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.850> water<00:01:16.909> out

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
is running and is draining the water out

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.989 
is running and is draining the water out
so<00:01:17.329> our<00:01:17.539> motor<00:01:17.749> and<00:01:17.929> pump<00:01:18.049> are<00:01:18.229> ok<00:01:18.850> how<00:01:19.850> our

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
so our motor and pump are ok how our

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:21.700 
so our motor and pump are ok how our
motor<00:01:20.179> connects<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:20.869> our<00:01:20.899> transmission<00:01:21.560> is

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
motor connects to our transmission is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.880 
motor connects to our transmission is
going<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.189> be<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.460> motor<00:01:23.090> coupler<00:01:23.479> or

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
going to be this motor coupler or

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.989 
going to be this motor coupler or
coupling<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.189> between<00:01:25.609> here

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
coupling in between here

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.330 
coupling in between here
and<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.109> turn<00:01:27.289> it<00:01:27.409> on<00:01:27.499> you'll<00:01:27.890> see<00:01:27.950> that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and if we turn it on you'll see that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.969 
and if we turn it on you'll see that
this<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:28.880> spinning<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.569> isn't<00:01:30.439> that<00:01:30.560> broking

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
this is spinning and isn't that broking

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.349 
this is spinning and isn't that broking
is<00:01:31.850> not<00:01:32.119> broken<00:01:32.359> so<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.200> motor<00:01:33.409> is

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
is not broken so the motor is

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.239 
is not broken so the motor is
transferring<00:01:35.359> power<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.259> transmission

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
transferring power to the transmission

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.249 
transferring power to the transmission
everything's<00:01:37.789> good<00:01:38.060> there<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> shaft<00:01:38.689> on<00:01:39.109> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
everything's good there the shaft on the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.109 
everything's good there the shaft on the
transmission<00:01:39.649> spinning<00:01:40.249> so<00:01:40.759> then<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.969> next

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
transmission spinning so then the next

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.749 
transmission spinning so then the next
thing<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.420> look<00:01:41.450> at<00:01:41.749> is<00:01:42.219> if<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.399> transmission

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
thing to look at is if the transmission

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.450 
thing to look at is if the transmission
is<00:01:43.999> doing<00:01:44.210> its<00:01:44.659> job<00:01:44.990> by<00:01:45.319> spending<00:01:46.009> our<00:01:46.219> clutch

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
is doing its job by spending our clutch

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.690 
is doing its job by spending our clutch
assembly<00:01:46.609> up<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:47.899> basically<00:01:48.020> our<00:01:48.700> motor

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
assembly up here so basically our motor

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.899 
assembly up here so basically our motor
shaft<00:01:50.679> goes<00:01:51.679> into<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.009> transmission<00:01:52.459> spins

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
shaft goes into the transmission spins

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.760 
shaft goes into the transmission spins
the<00:01:53.090> gears<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.539> gears<00:01:53.749> then<00:01:54.020> spin<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.409> shaft

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the gears the gears then spin the shaft

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.749 
the gears the gears then spin the shaft
coming<00:01:55.039> out<00:01:55.219> at<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> top<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
coming out at the top of the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.899 
coming out at the top of the
transmission<00:01:56.859> and<00:01:57.859> spins<00:01:58.249> this<00:01:58.399> clutch<00:01:58.700> up

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
transmission and spins this clutch up

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.660 
transmission and spins this clutch up
here<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.009> we're<00:02:01.009> gonna<00:02:01.100> go<00:02:01.189> ahead<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.429> turn<00:02:01.639> it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
here so we're gonna go ahead and turn it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.550 
here so we're gonna go ahead and turn it
on<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:01.939> see<00:02:02.450> what's<00:02:02.990> happening<00:02:03.560> with<00:02:03.709> it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.350 

all<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.310> don't<00:02:10.700> know<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.000> see<00:02:11.270> it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
all right I don't know if you can see it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.870 
all right I don't know if you can see it
but<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.959> see<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.260> our<00:02:12.380> motor<00:02:12.880> coupler

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
but you can see that our motor coupler

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.800 
but you can see that our motor coupler
is<00:02:14.150> spinning<00:02:14.660> which<00:02:15.200> means

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
is spinning which means

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.410 
is spinning which means
it's<00:02:17.050> sending<00:02:17.350> power<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> transmission

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it's sending power to the transmission

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.440 
it's sending power to the transmission
what<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:19.990> don't<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.920> our<00:02:21.190> motor<00:02:21.490> or<00:02:22.090> our

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
what we don't have is our motor or our

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.540 
what we don't have is our motor or our
clutch<00:02:22.900> our<00:02:23.349> brake<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.800> clutch<00:02:23.830> assembly<00:02:24.130> up

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
clutch our brake and clutch assembly up

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.300 
clutch our brake and clutch assembly up
here<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.959> not<00:02:26.200> spinning<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.130> means

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
here this is not spinning so that means

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.210 
here this is not spinning so that means
that<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.810> transmission<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.770> broken<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
that the transmission is broken that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.760 
that the transmission is broken that
it's<00:02:30.520> not<00:02:30.760> ascending<00:02:31.420> uh<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.560> rotating

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
it's not ascending uh it's not rotating

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.510 
it's not ascending uh it's not rotating
or<00:02:33.220> brake<00:02:33.819> or<00:02:34.030> clutch<00:02:34.060> or<00:02:34.510> spin<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.989> any<00:02:35.950> events

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
or brake or clutch or spin to any events

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.390 
or brake or clutch or spin to any events
so<00:02:36.760> what<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.810> do<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.400> replace

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so what we would have to do is replace

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.320 
so what we would have to do is replace
our<00:02:39.610> transmission<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.800> repair<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:41.950> machine

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
our transmission to repair this machine

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.640 
our transmission to repair this machine
alright<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.510> now<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.660> can<00:02:43.930> see<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> motor

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
alright so now you can see the motor

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.740 
alright so now you can see the motor
coupler<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.340> close-up<00:02:46.030> shot<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.390> coupler

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
coupler a close-up shot of the coupler

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.090 
coupler a close-up shot of the coupler
there<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.200> see<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.530> we<00:02:47.650> turn<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.950> back

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
there and you can see if we turn it back

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.410 
there and you can see if we turn it back
on<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:49.269> can<00:02:49.300> see<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.989> rotating<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.420> it's

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
on you can see it is rotating and it's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.339 
on you can see it is rotating and it's
spinning<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> shaft<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.880> transmission

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.690
