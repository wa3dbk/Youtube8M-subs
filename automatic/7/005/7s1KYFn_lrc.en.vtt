 of tanto spirit content on youtube 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.890
 at the beginning I did not believe it not first two 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.230
 thousand visitors then went more 10,000 and so 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.270
 it was growing now is the last the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.300
 the last time that the ché had 102 thousand 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.970
 visits is incredible and we all 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.180
 started in the game and but from that 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.710
 game when he says serious and thank god 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.680
 it has given us fruits that harvest brought 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.480
 a great impression this of music 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.790
 how to discover that talent that you had 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.370
 the music of knowing how to sing of being able to rhyme 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.310
 because it is rhyme what everything 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.960
 I hope rhymes good anyone can rhyme 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.070
 no but you have to put the style 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 you have to put an originality 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 I started writing when I was 17 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.770
 he wrote letters to the girlfriend there and from there 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.630
 I started was born the taste for rhyming and 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 make love songs and little by little 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.220
 with my buddies they liked what 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.960
 I was doing her songs 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.510
 different we not only give but of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 social 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.860
 lack of love and so and little by little when there was 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.910
 parties 15 years invited me and I 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.880
 I always asked for the snatched microphone and 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.040
 so I went thinking that the first song 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.710
 that you did as now as a producer 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.360

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.740
 of your first song the story that you 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 you had the first song that you 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.420

 through 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.950
 from producing something who consumes some 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.290
 video something that has inspired you to do 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.569
 a roll here in consumer or something like that 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.650

 precincts we start playing there with a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.170
 track and we already have the lyrics we have the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.290
 audio tomorrow we're going to record it and I think that 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.000
 on Sunday we're going to record it 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.000

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.520
 my friend's connection 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.120

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.210

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.240

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.419
 yes big music 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.610
 because it would be what I crave the most 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.400
 not because a producer or someone 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.160
 see and find me is not the dream of everything 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.050

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.210

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.330

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.940

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.770
 comply 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.600

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.930

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.889
 lead to the heart of consuming 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:08.020
 the affection of the people 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:11.319
 the support of the autographs 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.360

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.650

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.650

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.660
 republic not to see if 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.400
