Oh<00:00:08.310> two<00:00:08.700> layouts<00:00:09.150> there's<00:00:09.660> always<00:00:09.870> some

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
Oh two layouts there's always some

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.260 
Oh two layouts there's always some
interesting<00:00:11.010> things<00:00:11.220> that<00:00:11.370> people<00:00:11.820> may<00:00:12.030> or

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.270 
interesting things that people may or

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.360 
interesting things that people may or
may<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.780> seen<00:00:13.020> before<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.770> said<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
may not have seen before you said that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.630 
may not have seen before you said that
for<00:00:15.000> your

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
for your

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640 
for your
uncoupling<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.029> build<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.510> own

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
uncoupling you build your own

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
uncoupling you build your own
electromagnets<00:00:19.650> under<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.910> layout<00:00:21.270> that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
electromagnets under the the layout that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 
electromagnets under the the layout that
are<00:00:22.080> activated<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.250> guess<00:00:23.640> by<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> little

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
are activated I guess by the little

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
are activated I guess by the little
press<00:00:24.419> buttons<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.110> you<00:00:25.259> have<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.680> your

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
press buttons that you have on your

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.630 
press buttons that you have on your
panels<00:00:26.310> maybe<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.390> could<00:00:27.599> explain<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.289> us

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
panels maybe you could explain for us

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.040 
panels maybe you could explain for us
what<00:00:29.640> you've<00:00:29.849> done<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> terms<00:00:30.329> of<00:00:30.779> making

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
what you've done in terms of making

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.709 
what you've done in terms of making
these<00:00:32.600> I<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> tried<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
these I so I tried some of the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.030 
these I so I tried some of the
commercial<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.920> couplers<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.550> found<00:00:39.390> them

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
commercial on couplers and found them

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.410 
commercial on couplers and found them
some<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.520> sometimes<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.210> work

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
some you know sometimes they work

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.930 
some you know sometimes they work
sometimes<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:43.110> didn't<00:00:44.030> they<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.239> hot<00:00:45.770> I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
sometimes they didn't they get hot I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
sometimes they didn't they get hot I
work<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.420> facility<00:00:49.170> where<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.980> make

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
work in a facility where I can make

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
work in a facility where I can make
these<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.630> what<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.020> what's<00:00:52.950> what

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
these you know so what it's what's what

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
these you know so what it's what's what
it's<00:00:53.610> made<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.880> is<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:55.610> plastic<00:00:56.610> bobbin<00:00:57.140> there's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's made of is a plastic bobbin there's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.300 
it's made of is a plastic bobbin there's
a<00:00:58.280> thousand<00:00:59.300> turns<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.660> wire<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:01.290> here

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
a thousand turns of wire on here

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.980 
a thousand turns of wire on here
I've<00:01:03.210> machined<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.189> internal<00:01:05.659> core<00:01:06.659> piece

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I've machined the internal core piece

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.090 
I've machined the internal core piece
and<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> plates<00:01:11.960> go<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> core<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and the plates go on to that core and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
and the plates go on to that core and
then<00:01:14.360> creating<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> magnetism<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
then creating the magnetism right what I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.090 
then creating the magnetism right what I
tried<00:01:19.650> different<00:01:19.950> voltages<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:22.020> found<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.810> 24

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
tried different voltages I found in 24

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.340 
tried different voltages I found in 24
volts<00:01:26.600> ac<00:01:28.430> converted<00:01:29.430> into<00:01:29.940> DC<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.789 
volts ac converted into DC with a with a
rectifier<00:01:32.479> worked<00:01:33.479> best<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.049> sometimes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
rectifier worked best because sometimes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.870 
rectifier worked best because sometimes
I<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.310> mean<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.150> made<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.680> experimenting<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I I mean I I made it in experimenting I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
I I mean I I made it in experimenting I
sucked<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.409> railcar<00:01:40.650> right<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
sucked the the railcar right down the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 
sucked the the railcar right down the
track<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.090> was<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.510> girls<00:01:43.159> hold<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> coupler

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
track it was just girls hold the coupler

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.440 
track it was just girls hold the coupler
right<00:01:44.850> across<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> wanted<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
right across so I wanted to get to the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.219 
right across so I wanted to get to the
point<00:01:48.659> where<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.689> when<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
point where if you on when you when you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
point where if you on when you when you
spot<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> train<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.220> couplers<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.939> actually

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
spot a train the couplers will actually

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.500 
spot a train the couplers will actually
pull<00:01:54.720> apart<00:01:55.110> too<00:01:55.350> far<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> won't<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
pull apart too far and and it won't it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.780 
pull apart too far and and it won't it
won't<00:01:57.720> couple<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.650> four<00:01:58.920> properly<00:01:59.549> for

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
won't couple probably four properly for

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.830 
won't couple probably four properly for
spotting<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.840> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
spotting right so to get that that that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800 
spotting right so to get that that that
proper<00:02:04.619> voltage<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.580> proper<00:02:06.000> action<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
proper voltage in the proper action it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.460 
proper voltage in the proper action it
was<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> bit<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.350> experimentation<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:09.840> think

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
was a bit of experimentation but I think

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.649 
was a bit of experimentation but I think
I<00:02:10.590> got<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> got<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.730> any<00:02:11.909> well<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.269> can<00:02:12.480> have

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
I got a got it for any well we can have

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.500 
I got a got it for any well we can have
a<00:02:12.689> little<00:02:12.989> demonstration<00:02:13.200> how<00:02:13.799> they<00:02:13.980> work<00:02:14.510> on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
a little demonstration how they work on

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750 
a little demonstration how they work on
the<00:02:15.810> layout<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.110> little<00:02:16.290> later<00:02:16.650> okay<00:02:17.610> well

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the layout a little later okay well

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.569 
the layout a little later okay well
let's<00:02:17.909> do<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.659> just<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:19.769> sort<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.099> recap

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
let's do that so just to sort of recap

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.949 
let's do that so just to sort of recap
what<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:21.000> were<00:02:21.090> talking<00:02:21.510> about<00:02:21.599> with<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
what we were talking about with the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.190 
what we were talking about with the
magnets<00:02:23.090> what's<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.300> power<00:02:24.540> behind<00:02:24.870> these

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
magnets what's the power behind these

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.660 
magnets what's the power behind these
that<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.560> determine<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.099> was<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.459> about

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that you determine it was just about

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that you determine it was just about
right<00:02:26.940> 24<00:02:27.840> volts

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
right 24 volts

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.970 
right 24 volts
okay<00:02:29.040> AC<00:02:30.040> converted<00:02:30.910> into<00:02:31.090> DC<00:02:31.570> okay<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.590> let's

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
okay AC converted into DC okay so let's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.800 
okay AC converted into DC okay so let's
have<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.220> look<00:02:33.430> at<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> effect<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.420> when

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
have a look at the effect of that when

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
have a look at the effect of that when
you<00:02:35.380> draw<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.800> locomotive<00:02:36.190> forward<00:02:36.790> and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you draw this locomotive forward and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:52.230

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
very well as long as the couplers are

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.130 
very well as long as the couplers are
set<00:03:58.739> properly<00:03:58.920> as<00:03:59.879> one<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.239> couplers<00:04:00.629> and

set properly as one of the couplers and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.380 
set properly as one of the couplers and
the<00:04:01.890> nice<00:04:02.040> thing<00:04:02.310> about<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.700> many<00:04:02.819> turns<00:04:03.209> of

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the nice thing about so many turns of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.949 
the nice thing about so many turns of
wire<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.849> leave<00:04:05.849> something<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.420> or

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
wire is if you leave something on or

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.970 
wire is if you leave something on or
they<00:04:07.290> they<00:04:08.629> switch<00:04:09.629> remains<00:04:09.989> pressed<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
they they switch remains pressed and the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.600 
they they switch remains pressed and the
power<00:04:11.190> stays<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.450> them<00:04:12.920> they<00:04:13.920> won't<00:04:14.160> burn<00:04:14.400> out

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
power stays on them they won't burn out

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.000 
power stays on them they won't burn out
okay<00:04:15.299> that's<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:15.810> important<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:16.889> they

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
okay that's really important but they

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.689 
okay that's really important but they
don't<00:04:17.190> get<00:04:17.310> hot<00:04:17.519> yeah<00:04:18.060> yeah<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:19.370> guess<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.519> last

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699
