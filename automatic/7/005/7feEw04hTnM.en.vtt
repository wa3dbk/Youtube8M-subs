00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 Talk youtube guys and beauty with 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.639
 you bonetti in the area bringing another 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.609
 game play the black ops two here to 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.949
 you on the channel and this gameplay of today is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.800
 I'll be commenting on you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.350
 of some things we can take 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.830
 in considerations in the code 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.529
 First you see me there. 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 I spoke to you in this video title. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.989
 that 's my first form that I get 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.590
 in this two black ops really is true 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.290
 the the love it is a kidnapping you 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 unlock him in the last light 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.980
 of your prestige 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.420
 that is, I am not particularly 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.390
 playing a lot 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 so I'm not needing two or three 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.780
 I still do not know which cash might be the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 price of 3 and I had to honestly 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.129
 I will not give more prestige because I 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 I think it takes too long for you to evolve 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 How are you? I'm so long so. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.689
 at least this year here could be 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 available to the game so I will not go 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.560
 more prestige will now be with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.409
 all unlocked subscribers 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.920
 anything in this case I need 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 one is and has some in zig and for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.240
 Unlock, that's okay, I'll do it. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 prestige but I will not do it any more 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 moment because you really want to play 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 Yes, of course it's too far away. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 the best strike of the historic school and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 security cops 2 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.890
 It's what you enjoy the most is more 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.110
 strong them but many kills 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.189
 so if you want to play with it or if 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.869
 move it 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 or you do not do prestige because the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.540
 business is complicated as i'm not going 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.610
 make prestige 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 now yes I have is unlocked maybe 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 The time to do for you is one more time. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.820
 game place with them I already caught guess 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.000
 that two now I got one more throwing 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.299
 today that demolition in a want this 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.820
 it was not even the guy he kills a lot 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.619
 kills a lot in that before the open maps 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.239
 but I will not bring it because if it is not 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 because he is handsome for that athlete 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.819
 What do you have then unfortunately I will have to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.269
 give a bolivia and did not give 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.939
 the waste is in the channel but is very good the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.950
 homi I do not know yet which is one of the 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.480
 what are the best settings and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.329
 Let's say yes, it's one of the best. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.730
 settings you configure your 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.659
 The way I want to bring you to go 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.060
 in settings of schools 30 and some 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.219
 two or three settings that you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.170
 You can set up your work you your 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.090
 has a good performance and I do not have 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 Like bringing you guys because I do not 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.469
 I have a lot of experience but not as 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.569
 I want to bring yes to you with these 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.730
 The only thing I wanted to talk about 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.769
 You can see I had the bad luck of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.180
 playing in this part of the first 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.459
 Once I got going 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.409
 I entered the match in progress and when 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.969
 I got my first sound 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.579
 harman 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.689
 you will follow up with the 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.030
 right part 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.409
 the guy was very strong the team gave 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.269
 very strong that I was playing 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:13.269
 white board is far is in shape 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.090
 I'm not mistaken, this is what happened 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.280
 I like one plus one two players 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.199
 of my team were from blackburn too 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 which is the vital versatile 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.299
 so it's a very strong thing to 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.400
 means guys are going to leave you do not do a good 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.479
 then sometimes people 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.759
 talk is is for is good or bad is a wall 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:37.090
 cracked is good or bad without the advantages 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:41.169
 from the ceiling everything that is too bad does 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.159
 really the same in code as well 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:47.139
 very strong very strong you finish 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.209
 pressing the enemies a lot and they 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.290
 they end up leaving because you really stay 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.549
 no way out 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:59.229
 a very weak yellow-green part 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.879
 even then it's the game and make a good 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.090
 You have to go in that room. 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.549
 perfect so to speak in that room 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.370
 balanced and that everything goes well 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.930
 things and it's no use in this case I 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.180
 I 'm not good for you, I've seen 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.750
 I have a strong team going on and from there 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.620
 happened was the school also 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.280
 releasing got heavier in the team 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.139
 and it does not have not have another team not 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.750
 will hold even pressure and will leave 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.090
 you do not enjoy sometimes you do not 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.580
 many kilson enjoy the assistants 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.169
 orbital chat you will vote what 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.449
 remains loose 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.639
 so it does not have to 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.500
 have well balanced speech because 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.240
 really all it is too hurt 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.139
 here also if you do not have the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.930
 balance 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.250
 really will not do too much else 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.540
 The thing I wanted to talk to you played. 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.979
 is already the mother there 94 the latest software 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.570
 free that beautiful bruno takes 50 and 54 9 53 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.690
 54 in the year 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.090
 Dude, I really liked her as a sign. 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.130
 very good weapon I'll try to bring it to 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.110
 and configuration tips with it 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.539
 for some they have more of it 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.840
 I think she stays up much longer. 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.490
 accurate than the lack but that there is 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.740
 any further I'll bring it for you 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.930

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.880
 bring more videos to you is the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.100
