with<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.390> badly<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.080> butcher<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> word

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
with how badly can you butcher the word

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.939 
with how badly can you butcher the word
carburetor<00:00:20.990> can't<00:00:21.990> even<00:00:22.140> read<00:00:22.320> anything<00:00:22.650> on

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
carburetor can't even read anything on

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.349 
carburetor can't even read anything on
it<00:00:23.100> besides<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.699> weird<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.240> in

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it besides that weird it's all in

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.460 
it besides that weird it's all in
Chinese<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:26.539> they<00:00:27.539> need<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:27.869> batteries<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
Chinese and they need new batteries I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
Chinese and they need new batteries I
got<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> battery<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> more

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
got in one of that battery is more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
got in one of that battery is more
expensive<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> carburetor<00:00:31.189> more<00:00:32.189> than

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
expensive with the carburetor more than

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.090 
expensive with the carburetor more than
more<00:00:32.850> than<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> carburetor<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.840> yeah<00:00:34.100> these

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
more than the carburetor so yeah these

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.869 
more than the carburetor so yeah these
are<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.850> bad<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:37.649> guess<00:00:38.489> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
are actually not that bad I guess this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.990 
are actually not that bad I guess this
is<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.270> brake<00:00:39.930> line<00:00:40.730> that's<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is your brake line that's kind of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.340 
is your brake line that's kind of
interesting<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.629> Chinese<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> wouldn't

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
interesting for Chinese I wouldn't

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
interesting for Chinese I wouldn't
expect<00:00:43.410> them<00:00:43.829> these<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> breaks

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
expect them these that kind of breaks

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
expect them these that kind of breaks
with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> brake<00:00:45.329> pads<00:00:45.600> i<00:00:45.930> thought<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.739> use

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
with the brake pads i thought they use

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.360 
with the brake pads i thought they use
like<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> band<00:00:47.370> break<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.820> something<00:00:49.370> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
like a band break or something this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.139 
like a band break or something this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
engines between 50 and 110 cc Honda
clone<00:00:54.629> engine<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.260> normal<00:00:55.710> high<00:00:55.890> also

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
clone engine like normal high also

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
clone engine like normal high also
replaced<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> fuel<00:00:56.910> line<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> could<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.719> find

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
replaced the fuel line I could not find

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.700 
replaced the fuel line I could not find
like<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.570> black<00:01:00.570> fuel<00:01:00.899> line<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.530> on

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
like the black fuel line that was on

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
piece of tigon and used that that worked

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.710 
piece of tigon and used that that worked
front<00:01:07.140> shocks<00:01:07.409> looked<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:07.979> nice<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
your throttle you got to choke down here

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.370 
your throttle you got to choke down here
hit<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.299> easy<00:01:37.229> start<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> of

for<00:03:19.190> Chinese<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.790> wouldn't<00:03:20.030> think<00:03:20.150> I'd<00:03:20.300> run

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
for Chinese I wouldn't think I'd run

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:31.880
