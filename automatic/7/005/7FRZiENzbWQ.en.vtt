to<00:00:10.050> learn<00:00:10.290> some<00:00:11.099> clogging<00:00:11.340> steps<00:00:11.880> where<00:00:12.269> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
to learn some clogging steps where you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.530 
to learn some clogging steps where you
get<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.630> turn<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> circle<00:00:14.089> earlier<00:00:15.089> we

step<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> make<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.630> easier<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
step now to make it easier so that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
step now to make it easier so that
you're<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.860> getting<00:01:47.040> dizzy<00:01:47.460> turning<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you're not getting dizzy turning and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.840 
you're not getting dizzy turning and
turning<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.720> turning<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.700> be

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
turning and turning I think it would be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
turning and turning I think it would be
more<00:01:51.030> fun<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.930> start<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.710> basics

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
more fun to put start with two basics

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.539 
more fun to put start with two basics
and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> turn<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.040> basics

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and then do a turn and then two basics

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
and then do a turn and then two basics
and<00:01:56.729> turn<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> other<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.750> let's<00:01:58.140> try<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and turn the other way so let's try that

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.660 
and turn the other way so let's try that
one<00:01:58.890> let's<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> two<00:01:59.759> regular<00:02:00.210> basics<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
one let's do two regular basics and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.959

double steps then come up and start

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.280 
double steps then come up and start
turning<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.580> left<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.239> go<00:03:22.420> heel<00:03:22.840> heel

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
turning to the left as you go heel heel

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.880 
turning to the left as you go heel heel
step<00:03:23.680> step<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.760> you're<00:03:24.910> around<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.440> facing

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
step step and you're around so facing

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.140 
step step and you're around so facing
the<00:03:27.100> front<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.550> then<00:03:27.640> turning<00:03:27.970> back<00:03:28.120> around

the front and then turning back around

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.830 
the front and then turning back around
do<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.720> same<00:03:29.020> thing<00:03:29.320> two<00:03:29.620> double<00:03:29.950> steps<00:03:30.840> heel

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840

do the same thing two double steps heel
heel<00:03:32.320> step<00:03:32.350> step<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.150> again<00:03:34.660> same<00:03:34.989> principle

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
heel step step so again same principle

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.720 
heel step step so again same principle
we<00:03:35.680> don't<00:03:35.860> want<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.040> keep<00:03:36.160> turning<00:03:36.459> and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
we don't want to keep turning and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.310 
we don't want to keep turning and
turning<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.209> turning<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.750> let's<00:03:37.930> start<00:03:38.200> with

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
turning and turning so let's start with

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.040 
turning and turning so let's start with
