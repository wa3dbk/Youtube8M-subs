00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
I had to make a set on it myself and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.200 
I had to make a set on it myself and
yeah<00:00:44.640> let's<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.210> cover<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.690> basis<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.950> um

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
yeah let's let's cover the basis here um

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
yeah let's let's cover the basis here um
the<00:00:48.210> V's<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.200> straightforward<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the V's are pretty straightforward I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
the V's are pretty straightforward I
would<00:00:50.760> run<00:00:50.940> modest<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.989> modest<00:00:52.500> gives

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
would run modest because modest gives

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.600 
would run modest because modest gives
you<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> most<00:00:53.070> power<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.710> run<00:00:56.010> since

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you the most power and I would run since

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
you the most power and I would run since
you<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.090> running<00:00:57.300> hidden<00:00:57.539> power<00:00:57.690> fire<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you are running hidden power fire and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.029 
you are running hidden power fire and
your<00:00:59.039> V's<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.059> IVs<00:01:00.480> excuse<00:01:00.870> me<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.260> lower<00:01:01.800> than

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
your V's or IVs excuse me are lower than

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
your V's or IVs excuse me are lower than
normal<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.760> run<00:01:02.910> 266<00:01:03.750> speed<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
normal I would run 266 speed just to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
normal I would run 266 speed just to
outspeed<00:01:05.280> Jolly<00:01:05.610> tyrantrum<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.570> kill<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
outspeed Jolly tyrantrum and kill it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
power poison because the neutral surf is

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.740 
power poison because the neutral surf is
more<00:04:59.130> powerful<00:04:59.610> than<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.850> power<00:05:00.030> poison<00:05:00.450> like

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750
