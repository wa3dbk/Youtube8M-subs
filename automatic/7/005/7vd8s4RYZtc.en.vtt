00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello to all the boys who have come in that way 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.410
 video not here today to present this 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 nice truck this is the engine that is 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.590
 exit recently finds itself on yes way 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.220
 will obviously leave the link description is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.140
 a point 1 version and excuse one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.240
 version 1.0 is an ex or 18 40 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 the two-axle tractor is very simple 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.150
 made really made by god of decided 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.220
 present because it is one of the few trucks 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.570
 who has found that they really go 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.630
 good both as a guide and as a texture 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.750
 details and everything changes I know them 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.970
 pretty good so then i can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.650
 tell you that he did really well 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.019
 the only thing that bleeding he has not 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.590
 noticed when it is still wobbles a little 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.850
 true i know i don't really know what that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.830
 then there can be no problem 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.530
 simple motive you can stick 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.689
 behind the flatbed trailers type barrels 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.539
 the blue one of the area me the one for 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 in short, transporting all of the sewage 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.829
 what can be sick 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.380
 then let's do it inside 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.380
 see the most beautiful thing 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.610
 then unfortunately I cannot come 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 you feel good as you can see there 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.540
 are the rear-view mirrors that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 they work and the beauty is that they can 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.850
 Also you can move them with the mouse 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.800
 move the swings while holding the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.410
 left button 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 you can whip right to left and up 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.280
 down 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.200
 same thing as right click you can move 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.510
 the one on your right up and down 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.220
 which serves to sell the corpse the stuff 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.729
 first time i see a way like that with 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.120
 the mirrors is really cool 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.160
 because you barely think now that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.150
 one will use this even more often 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 change here because really nice then and 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.830
 we have the rev counter and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:34.420
 odometer that also moves 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.010
 the diesel fuel goes up and down a lot 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.980
 comfortable mirrors of course 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.769
 maneuver we have left arrow which 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.610
 it also lights up on display four 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.160
 arrows the text 2 the 3 arrow key 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.080
 right 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.610
 here and when when practically 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.750
 turn on it will charge practically 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.090
 air and when it lights up where they need to 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.310
 charge tanks of the area you will hear 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.019
 like the sound of the bomb charging and then 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
 you will have handbrake inserted which one 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.200
 takes away with space 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.770
 the only thing that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.209
 I can't keep the headlights on because 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.700
 Milan will not be turned on they do not have 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.290
 let's say so the car considered short 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.989
 pro search attached a trailer ho 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.690
 noticed that they stay on 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.920
 so I know maybe if you are also 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 more valid but managed to solve 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.730
 all the arrows are there 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.150
 see from outside with the 6 button you have 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.150
 back light 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.319
 here lies the misguided maneuver or 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.340
 load the allowed platforms this is 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.340
 the area pump 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.530
 I get off he otherwise happens a mess and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.150
 nothing is enough 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.000
 I really recommend it to you 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.459
 veil driven by fact transports with 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.790
 flatbed trailers everything really goes by 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.790
 god and nothing i will do visual tutor linking 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.319
 description as always I greet you and vi 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.319
 thank you next video bye bye
