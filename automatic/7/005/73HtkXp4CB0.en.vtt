00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 maximum 20 today to present the emulator 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 of the p esp for our brand 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.759
 and now a lot out there but there are two 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.759
 emulation options the jp ssp 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.810
 I've only seen it work on windows and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.430
 macintosh 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.160
 the truth can never be it 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.720
 the one that I will show you is this emulator the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.720
 pp that is the pp 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.050
 are the ones that configuring is a bit to 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.730
 those who do not have much experience in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.710
 two things that have to be done but it's 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.040
 very easy first thing we're going to do 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.540
 is to download it 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.740
 we search here 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.330
 s 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.330
 and we downloaded the first poster 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 Discharged 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.760
 this has contributed in two parts in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 file but you do not have to do it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.689
 we're just going to leave it there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 what we have to do is install 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.810
 debris if we see here what it is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.869
 basically the first thing that we have to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.100
 do is install be completed for this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.909
 the dncd 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.549
 some of sounding to Chinese but not 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.260
 The first thing we have to do is go 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.530
 to the apple store 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.409
 and download the x code 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.329
 of ap 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.810
 that is fundamental if we already have it 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.490
 charger x with the player work 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.500
 then we're just going to go to the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.259
 appstore and we're going to download the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.390
 team once we have downloaded the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.140
 What are we going to do? 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.860
 is to go to the part d 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.860
 I will go 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.650
 the veterans team 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.000
 and let's go to preferences 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.670
 to downloads I only have installed but 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.140
 what we have to download is the part 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 of the itunes commands 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:29.500
 once downloaded the online tools part 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 that is downloaded as I say there 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.900
 the following is already the command part 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.720
 let's go again applications to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.880
 utilities and we're going to open a terminal 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 once we are in the terminal what 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 first thing we're going to do is download 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.170
 discs 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.580
 here they put a route to install it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.580
 eight hours I'll put 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.360
 basically what we will do is copy 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.350
 this 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 and let's talk 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.880
 now what we are going to do 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.409
 and we're going to see this command once 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.780
 the bottom part in the 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.230
 with cold at some point you will ask 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.540
 if I win we all put a price there 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.670
 pull all 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.610
 because how and very quickly 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.760
 let's scale the cdn basically you 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.459
 we put this command and leave 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.350
 intro in this case already tells me that what 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.080
 I have given 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.520
 and then let's run the brightness 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.210
 doctor to see that everything is in 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.210
 terms 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.020
 from here we have learned 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.020
 served cut a little 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.190
 but basically to know old all 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.460
 installed all this because we already have everything 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.460
 what we need 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.140
 the games 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.810
 in my case, I 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.910
 I have here in my psc folder 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.650
 here I have the roms I have place and some 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.650
 more than I do not know if they work because I do not 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.440
 work and here I have inside what is the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.230
 folder we will execute 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.270
 and they see that it is repeated 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.270
 once inside it 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 we go here to adjustments also the system 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.960
 the language in graphics 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.539
 graphic options 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.139
 I have removed something and something like 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.139
 for example 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.220
 rendering by buffer looks a bit 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.729
 worse but the truth that 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.550
 the much more fluid equation 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.530
 and the sound then 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.320
 it does not convince me when I play 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:05.750
 but good you can travel 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.750
 yes this the emulator of the psp 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.770
 I say goodbye and starting the game to 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.240
 that works and see you in the next 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.650
 video anything or doubt you know 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.020
 in any doubt 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.020
 sending a message that goes very well
