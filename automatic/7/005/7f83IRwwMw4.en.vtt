00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
around the skid pad it got point 8g

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.330 
around the skid pad it got point 8g
which<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.810> good<00:01:23.080> for<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.380> front<00:01:23.710> drive<00:01:23.979> small

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340
