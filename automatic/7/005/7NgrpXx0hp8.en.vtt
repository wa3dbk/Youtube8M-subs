see<00:01:07.290> even<00:01:07.650> though<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> budget<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.189> gonna

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
see even though the budget we're gonna

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500 
see even though the budget we're gonna
be<00:01:08.430> pretty<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.760> pretty<00:01:08.939> ready<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.360> games

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
be pretty much pretty ready for games

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
be pretty much pretty ready for games
like<00:01:09.659> Battlefield<00:01:09.810> 4<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.470> called<00:01:10.710> duty<00:01:11.010> ghosts

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like Battlefield 4 or called duty ghosts

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
like Battlefield 4 or called duty ghosts
all<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.630> uh<00:01:13.700> especially<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.500> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
all that so uh especially with the the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.820 
all that so uh especially with the the
32<00:01:17.040> gigs<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> ddr3<00:01:18.320> 2133<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.530> mean<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> know

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
32 gigs of ddr3 2133 I mean you know

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
32 gigs of ddr3 2133 I mean you know
this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> budget<00:01:20.310> bill<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:20.939> pretty

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
this is a budget bill but that's pretty

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.660 
this is a budget bill but that's pretty
essential<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.020> Battlefield<00:01:22.500> 4<00:01:23.180> obviously

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
essential for Battlefield 4 obviously

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
essential for Battlefield 4 obviously
even<00:01:26.670> though<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> costs<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.299> much<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> rest

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
even though it costs as much as the rest

00:01:27.900 --> 00:03:53.160 
even though it costs as much as the rest
of<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> computer<00:01:32.119> alright

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.570 

now<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.320> they<00:03:54.500> say<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.980> proof<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
now as they say the proof is in the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.430 
now as they say the proof is in the
pudding<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:56.690> let's<00:03:56.840> go<00:03:56.930> ahead<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.200> try<00:03:57.380> this

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
pudding so let's go ahead and try this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.080 
pudding so let's go ahead and try this
pudding<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:58.010> see<00:03:58.100> just<00:03:58.220> how<00:03:58.310> quiet<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.820> really

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
pudding and see just how quiet it really

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:37.390 
pudding and see just how quiet it really
is

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.330 

so<00:04:37.940> know<00:04:38.180> if<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.360> can<00:04:38.510> hear<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.340> it's

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so know if you can hear that it's

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.770 
so know if you can hear that it's
actually<00:04:40.730> pretty<00:04:40.940> damn<00:04:41.180> quiet<00:04:46.240> okay<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.540> kind

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
actually pretty damn quiet okay you kind

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.060 
actually pretty damn quiet okay you kind
of<00:04:47.840> really<00:04:48.050> have<00:04:48.139> to<00:04:48.229> get<00:04:48.350> up<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.830> hear

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
of really have to get up to it to hear

00:04:49.070 --> 00:05:00.700 
of really have to get up to it to hear
it<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.880> ultimately<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.720> think<00:05:00.350> we've<00:05:00.440> learned<00:05:00.560> a

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it so ultimately I think we've learned a

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.030 
it so ultimately I think we've learned a
couple<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:00.979> things<00:05:02.680> we've<00:05:03.680> learned<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:03.979> you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
couple of things we've learned that you

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.390 
couple of things we've learned that you
don't<00:05:04.160> actually<00:05:04.610> need<00:05:05.120> ddr3<00:05:06.100> 2133<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.250> your

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
don't actually need ddr3 2133 in your

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.180 
don't actually need ddr3 2133 in your
budget<00:05:07.880> gaming<00:05:08.360> build<00:05:08.860> that's<00:05:09.860> what<00:05:10.010> we<00:05:10.070> call

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
budget gaming build that's what we call

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.969 
budget gaming build that's what we call
a<00:05:10.220> joke<00:05:10.960> but<00:05:11.960> we've<00:05:12.080> also<00:05:12.229> learned<00:05:12.350> that<00:05:12.620> for<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
a joke but we've also learned that for a

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.980 
a joke but we've also learned that for a
reasonable<00:05:13.610> amount<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.030> money<00:05:14.090> not<00:05:14.540> too<00:05:14.750> much

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
reasonable amount of money not too much

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.330 
reasonable amount of money not too much
you<00:05:15.020> can<00:05:15.229> actually<00:05:15.440> build<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.830> pretty<00:05:16.010> decent

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
you can actually build a pretty decent

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.860 
you can actually build a pretty decent
gaming<00:05:16.610> system<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.090> doesn't<00:05:17.419> really<00:05:17.690> make

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
gaming system that doesn't really make

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.740 
gaming system that doesn't really make
much<00:05:18.050> noise<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:19.210> we've<00:05:20.210> learned<00:05:20.450> that<00:05:20.630> you

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
much noise and we've learned that you

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.070 
much noise and we've learned that you
