 sorry I hope you catch me to listen 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.910
 what happens is that today I woke up to this 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.339
 again act bad from colliding 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.570
 I bring all of the blue flu from 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.840
 week and today good relapses I hope 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.259
 listen to this my intention making them 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.820
 this mini tutorial is that they can capture 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.920
 the idea of ​​how to use the new 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.839
 product that I'm promoting what 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.399
 well I have baptized him with a seal 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.790
 stamping 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.039
 this one unlike the plates this ones 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.329
 drawings equal good come integrated 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.920
 here in the rubber this its use is not very 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.120
 difficult but good requires a little 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.680
 of put patience I'm here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 Use enamel with the special white and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.109
 the colors are the 1310 cursed 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.870
 so many that come in the package come 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.570
 including the package that comes to them 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.329
 the color inks are random 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 can come red white black can 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.960
 come like this and purple blue and ro this and this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.040
 white that I just did I did it with 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.060
 an enamel 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.510
 normal that in fact is not good or of 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.170
 well- known brand so it's a varnish of 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.800
 regular use whatsoever I am going to 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.300
 proceed to clean the nail with a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 little acetone 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.790
 to clean the designs that I bring 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.790
 already in the one 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.880
 right now to begin the process good 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 I talk about them because I'm going to move this the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.070
 cardboard and good and it will move a bit 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.759
 the camera this what you have to do is 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 place the varnish 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.090
 in the drawing in the design as if it were 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.220
 the metal plate 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.650
 I always tried to clean by 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.950
 anything is applying the enamel 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.750
 and the excess excess enamel in the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.849
 image will be removed in this way 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 pressing until the image comes out 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.720
 completely clean that nothing else is left 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.750
 the enamel in the design if they are fixed 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.080
 well that several brands that was the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.460
 flowers that I put on 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.240
 if you notice the marks are here 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:51.110
 the first is the first stamped here 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 is the second the third the fourth 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.530
 they are about four times and if 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.170
 they already have a little practice with the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.760
 Normal stamp can be removed if nothing 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.910
 they are left here a little bit more 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.780
 the excess and already prints it to 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.120
 difference of the conap see that in the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.600
 cones or on any other plate we make 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.780
 this is not here 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.510
 and they are not marked the movement is not 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.930
 so what did he do in what 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.790
 call in rolling motion is not so much 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:35.390
 but it's more like that and press 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.990
 it comes out and I'm going to do it to get it 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.850
 a little bit because if it's right now for the 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.110
 the weather is quite cold right here in 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.750
 the DF 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.260
 and I left a while ago and I think I came back more 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.260
 snore 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.610
 I'm going to be the same design 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 so they can see how the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.760
 varnish there that goes there 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.760
 and I proceed to remove him from anchor by removing 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.720
 the excess of varnish 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.720
 I here what I do 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.910
 is to remove it 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.770
 and how special color are they going to put 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.330
 allows me to do this I will not proceed to 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.330
 print me on the image 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.530
 standard ibai 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.560
 comes out here is a little bit this is 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.750
 clean with the acetone now so that 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.000
 see that if it works with the inks 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.600
 let's do to me I like the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.230
 little flowers then it's not going to be this 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.230
 little flowers 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.880
 ace 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 same procedure we are going to 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.510
 remove the excess in this way until 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.530
 come out on the rubber completely clean and 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.530
 I proceed to stamp 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.970
 pressed 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.970
 and there are the little flowers now 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.040
 even this is varnish of regular use the 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.260
 which is included is not special 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.289
 is a regular pernicious that brings the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.700
 package 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.210
 there is 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.210
 you 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.379
 - I was thinking about adding another 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.899
 design but I do not think that is enough 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.279
 he looks very father looks very elegant and 

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:56.519
 well this is basically the 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.770
 method for using the stamps 

00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:01.590
 stampers 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.590
 and the purchase mechanics is the following 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.020
 the packages come very varied but 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.080
 there is always one that brings borders or 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.759
 flowers then I would not like that 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.970
 you tell me hey, I want a 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.740
 package a set that brings valances 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.680
 then I go with my distributor 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.280
 look for a package with some borders that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.220
 have a stamp of borders and that is the 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.310
 who sent them the colors of the inks 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.169
 I repeat it is totally random with 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.229
 here in the camera by the light I do not understand 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.740
 why but this is purple is purple 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.650
 purple is not blue this is blue 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.830
 obscure then he's in for the tone and 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.930
 Well the red this I hope you have them 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.080
 I liked it there when I got the idea 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.969
 could hear and this good this 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.830
 be a happy year and thank you very much 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.319

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.150

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.580
