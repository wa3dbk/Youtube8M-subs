assistant<00:00:37.590> manager<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.570> I<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.800> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
assistant manager and I think that I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.389 
assistant manager and I think that I
think<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.149> big<00:00:42.420> role<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.870> play<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
think he is a very big role to play I

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.180 
think he is a very big role to play I
think<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.870> for<00:00:45.870> instance<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.920> club

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think that for instance when I at club

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.750 
think that for instance when I at club
level<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.629> had<00:00:48.989> John<00:00:49.530> Robertson<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.610> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
level I was I had John Robertson it was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.580 
level I was I had John Robertson it was
an<00:00:50.850> old<00:00:51.000> teammate<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> mine<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.140> years<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
an old teammate of mine in years and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.779 
an old teammate of mine in years and
years<00:00:52.770> ago<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.120> trusted<00:00:55.020> John's

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
years ago but I I trusted John's

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.459 
years ago but I I trusted John's
judgment<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.969> players<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.600> trusted<00:00:58.289> his

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
judgment on players I trusted his

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.340 
judgment on players I trusted his
opinion<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.789> would<00:01:00.030> obviously<00:01:00.570> discussed

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
opinion we would obviously discussed

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
opinion we would obviously discussed
team<00:01:01.980> selections<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> such<00:01:02.969> things<00:01:03.239> like

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
team selections and such things like

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.929 
team selections and such things like
that<00:01:03.799> eventually<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> me

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that eventually it would be doing to me

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.620 
that eventually it would be doing to me
to<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.990> those<00:01:07.290> those<00:01:08.630> decisions

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to make those so those those decisions

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
to make those so those those decisions
that<00:01:10.020> neither<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:11.040> cost<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.549> matches<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.090> win

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that neither can cost you matches or win

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.679 
that neither can cost you matches or win
you<00:01:12.420> games<00:01:12.650> but<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.420> would

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you games but I think that we we would

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
you games but I think that we we would
be<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.140> warm<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.860> aspect<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.240> listen

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
be as warm in that aspect I will listen

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.240 
be as warm in that aspect I will listen
to<00:01:18.659> him<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.049> he's<00:01:19.350> mean<00:01:19.920> he's<00:01:19.950> been

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to him I think he's mean he's been

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.140 
to him I think he's mean he's been
iconic<00:01:20.820> figure<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.270> football<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.610> worth

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
iconic figure in football and and worth

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.609 
iconic figure in football and and worth
listening<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.650> overall<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
listening to but overall I think that I

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.179 
listening to but overall I think that I
eventually<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:28.920> has<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> be

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
eventually I think there has to be

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
eventually I think there has to be
really<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.909> voice<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> end<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> day
