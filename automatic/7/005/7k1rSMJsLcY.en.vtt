friend no one knows and he was there
longer<00:03:45.400> than<00:03:45.490> me<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.360> um<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:47.140> had<00:03:47.290> waited<00:03:47.680> it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
longer than me so um we had waited it

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.460 
longer than me so um we had waited it
was<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.280> was<00:03:48.370> overnight<00:03:48.610> maybe<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.300> 15<00:03:49.990> 16

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
was it was overnight maybe like 15 16

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.920 
was it was overnight maybe like 15 16
hours<00:03:51.040> which<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.580> not<00:03:51.880> even<00:03:52.150> bad<00:03:52.330> compared<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
hours which is not even bad compared to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.090 
hours which is not even bad compared to
something<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:53.350> some<00:03:53.470> people<00:03:53.710> camp<00:03:53.920> out<00:03:54.070> for

something for some people camp out for
five<00:03:54.430> days<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.810> um<00:03:56.250> that's<00:03:57.250> probably<00:03:57.580> the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
five days so um that's probably the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.920 
five days so um that's probably the
worst<00:03:57.820> tank<00:03:58.060> just<00:03:58.300> because<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.570> was<00:03:58.600> really
