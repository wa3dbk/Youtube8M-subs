consider<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> possibility<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.270> building<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
consider the possibility of building a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:42.850 
consider the possibility of building a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.169 

this<00:05:02.919> interesting<00:05:03.399> we<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:03.669> some<00:05:03.819> roofing

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:04.179 
this interesting we have some roofing

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.540 
this interesting we have some roofing
tin<00:05:04.449> here<00:05:04.779> so<00:05:05.770> we're<00:05:05.949> not<00:05:06.039> that<00:05:06.249> far<00:05:06.490> from

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
tin here so we're not that far from

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.669 
tin here so we're not that far from
civilization<00:05:07.119> the<00:05:07.899> truth<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.259> the<00:05:08.319> matter<00:05:08.499> is

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:08.679 
civilization the truth of the matter is

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:10.499 
civilization the truth of the matter is
this<00:05:08.949> is<00:05:09.009> a<00:05:09.159> simulation<00:05:09.490> right<00:05:10.059> you<00:05:10.360> can

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
this is a simulation right you can

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.449 
this is a simulation right you can
actually<00:05:10.839> hear<00:05:10.990> traffic<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.800> reality<00:05:12.429> is

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:12.459 
actually hear traffic the reality is

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.239 
actually hear traffic the reality is
that<00:05:12.610> if<00:05:12.999> I<00:05:13.179> got<00:05:13.389> stuck<00:05:13.839> out<00:05:14.050> here<00:05:14.559> I<00:05:14.740> would

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:15.249 
that if I got stuck out here I would

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.339 
that if I got stuck out here I would
walk<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.759> the<00:05:15.849> road<00:05:16.059> and<00:05:16.330> flag<00:05:16.719> down<00:05:16.779> the<00:05:17.020> first

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
walk to the road and flag down the first

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.779 
walk to the road and flag down the first
driver<00:05:17.619> that<00:05:17.830> came<00:05:18.039> by<00:05:18.219> what<00:05:18.639> we're

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
driver that came by what we're

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.429 
driver that came by what we're
illustrating<00:05:19.360> here<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.749> building<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.169> shelter

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
illustrating here is building a shelter

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:31.710 
illustrating here is building a shelter
so<00:05:21.159> you<00:05:21.939> have<00:05:22.089> to<00:05:22.209> pretend

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.630 

I<00:05:34.740> thought<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:35.920> would<00:05:36.100> look<00:05:36.280> pretty<00:05:36.550> good

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
I thought this would look pretty good

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.930 
I thought this would look pretty good
because<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:38.500> is<00:05:38.650> going<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.860> make<00:05:38.980> it<00:05:39.040> fairly

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
because this is going to make it fairly

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.620 
because this is going to make it fairly
easy<00:05:40.090> for<00:05:40.660> me<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.780> hang<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.140> poncho<00:05:42.630> this

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
easy for me to hang the poncho this

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.530 
easy for me to hang the poncho this
place<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:44.050> good<00:05:44.260> enough<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.460> could<00:05:46.180> use<00:05:46.210> it

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
place is good enough and I could use it

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.000 
place is good enough and I could use it
so<00:05:46.690> I've<00:05:46.780> added<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:47.140> fireplace<00:05:47.590> that's<00:05:47.800> going

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
so I've added a fireplace that's going

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.640 
so I've added a fireplace that's going
to<00:05:48.070> work<00:05:48.190> for<00:05:48.250> me<00:05:49.290> but<00:05:50.290> I'm<00:05:50.410> going<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.590> keep

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
to work for me but I'm going to keep

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.770 
to work for me but I'm going to keep
looking<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:51.400> ground<00:05:51.670> is<00:05:51.760> very<00:05:51.820> wet<00:05:52.210> another

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
looking this ground is very wet another

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.270 
looking this ground is very wet another
thing<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.080> that<00:05:53.260> while<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.680> thought<00:05:53.950> this<00:05:54.070> might

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
thing is that while I thought this might

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.210 
thing is that while I thought this might
be<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.460> nice<00:05:54.930> natural<00:05:55.930> windbreak<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.830> fact<00:05:57.070> is

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
be a nice natural windbreak the fact is

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.250 
be a nice natural windbreak the fact is
I<00:05:57.460> can<00:05:57.610> feel<00:05:57.880> all<00:05:57.910> this<00:05:58.240> cold<00:05:58.540> air<00:05:58.720> coming<00:05:59.050> down

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
I can feel all this cold air coming down

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260 
I can feel all this cold air coming down
funneling<00:05:59.800> down<00:05:59.830> here<00:06:00.250> it's<00:06:00.670> just<00:06:00.910> drifting

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
funneling down here it's just drifting

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.610 
funneling down here it's just drifting
down<00:06:01.420> slowly<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.140> is<00:06:02.760> noticeable<00:06:03.760> and

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
down slowly but it is noticeable and

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.200 
down slowly but it is noticeable and
that's<00:06:05.620> going<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:05.980> awfully<00:06:06.160> chilly<00:06:06.580> let's

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
that's going to be awfully chilly let's

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.200 
that's going to be awfully chilly let's
keep<00:06:07.390> moving<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:12.400> spot<00:06:12.700> right<00:06:12.730> there<00:06:12.940> is<00:06:13.180> a

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
keep moving that spot right there is a

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:20.430 
keep moving that spot right there is a
possibility<00:06:13.720> these<00:06:14.140> rocks<00:06:18.810> if<00:06:19.810> I<00:06:19.960> put<00:06:20.170> a<00:06:20.200> fire

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
possibility these rocks if I put a fire

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.840 
possibility these rocks if I put a fire
in<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.740> area<00:06:21.070> these<00:06:21.220> rocks<00:06:21.490> are<00:06:21.640> going<00:06:21.790> to

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
in this area these rocks are going to

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.190 
in this area these rocks are going to
heat<00:06:22.030> up<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.330> radiate<00:06:22.660> back<00:06:22.870> some<00:06:23.050> heat

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
heat up and radiate back some heat

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:33.320 
heat up and radiate back some heat
that'd<00:06:23.380> be<00:06:23.500> nice
