00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
towel this is very important we've done

a<00:03:04.020> good<00:03:04.200> job<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.590> part<00:03:04.800> till<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.100> we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
a good job with the part till now we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
a good job with the part till now we
don't<00:03:05.430> want<00:03:05.640> any<00:03:05.820> contamination<00:03:06.390> related

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
don't want any contamination related

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.570 
don't want any contamination related
issues<00:03:07.200> once<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.160> start<00:03:08.430> spraying

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.090 

I<00:03:11.720> can't<00:03:12.720> say<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.020> often<00:03:13.170> enough<00:03:13.440> make<00:03:13.920> sure

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
I can't say it often enough make sure

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.260 
I can't say it often enough make sure
and<00:03:14.250> get<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.490> all<00:03:14.580> little<00:03:14.880> cracks<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
and get in all little cracks and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.060 
and get in all little cracks and
crevices<00:03:15.360> especially<00:03:16.320> those<00:03:16.440> mounting<00:03:16.800> areas

because<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:17.610> where<00:03:17.790> adhesion<00:03:18.030> will

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
because that's where adhesion will

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.960 
because that's where adhesion will
really<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.630> tested<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:20.130> video<00:03:20.370> title<00:03:20.760> says

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
but in this case it's ready to spray so

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410 
but in this case it's ready to spray so
all<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.990> need<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.470> load<00:03:34.680> your<00:03:34.860> gun<00:03:35.420> get

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
all you need to do is load your gun get

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
all you need to do is load your gun get
rid<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> strainer<00:03:36.960> and<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:38.040> go<00:03:38.160> spray

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
rid of the strainer and then go spray

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.250 
rid of the strainer and then go spray
the<00:03:38.550> part

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.630 

what<00:03:43.260> we're<00:03:43.380> using<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.770> as<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> topcoat<00:03:44.190> gun

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
what we're using here as a topcoat gun

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.460 
what we're using here as a topcoat gun
since<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.270> part<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.660> topcoat<00:03:45.870> system

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
since this is part of a topcoat system

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.840 
since this is part of a topcoat system
and<00:03:46.650> every<00:03:46.830> layer<00:03:47.010> has<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.400> be<00:03:47.520> very<00:03:47.730> very

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
and every layer has to be very very

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.910 
and every layer has to be very very
smooth<00:03:48.240> we're<00:03:49.020> gonna<00:03:49.110> use<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.319> good<00:03:49.590> quality

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
smooth we're gonna use a good quality

editions to how far it's going to be so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.480 
editions to how far it's going to be so
that<00:04:04.050> we<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.320> hold<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.890> distance<00:04:05.310> and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
that we can hold it at that distance and

make sure and get a nice even coat we

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
make sure and get a nice even coat we

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
want to tack it off like we would any

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.870 
want to tack it off like we would any
part<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.110> then<00:04:10.890> when<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.160> spray<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.730> want

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
part and then when we spray it we want

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.400 
part and then when we spray it we want
to<00:04:11.970> spray<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> single<00:04:12.660> flowing<00:04:12.989> coat<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.260> this

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
to spray a single flowing coat of this

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.590 
to spray a single flowing coat of this
material<00:04:13.920> we<00:04:14.610> don't<00:04:14.820> want<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.000> be<00:04:15.090> shy<00:04:15.330> with<00:04:15.570> it

although it will be transparent because

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.400 
although it will be transparent because
it's<00:04:18.030> clear<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.329> doesn't<00:04:19.079> mean<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.290> we

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
it's clear that doesn't mean that we

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.949 
it's clear that doesn't mean that we
want<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.680> thin<00:04:19.950> layer<00:04:20.190> or<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.669> dry<00:04:21.060> layer<00:04:21.329> we<00:04:21.780> want

want a thin layer or a dry layer we want

want a thin layer or a dry layer we want
it<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.109> be<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> good<00:04:22.500> solid<00:04:22.830> foundation<00:04:23.550> for

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
it to be a good solid foundation for

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.550 
it to be a good solid foundation for
what<00:04:23.760> we're<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.330> put<00:04:24.510> over<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.410> that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
what we're about to put over it so that

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
what we're about to put over it so that
means<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.919> we<00:04:26.010> have<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> nice<00:04:26.910> even

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
means that we have to have a nice even

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600 
means that we have to have a nice even
flow<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.840> coat<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.320> that's<00:04:28.860> evident<00:04:29.310> by<00:04:29.460> how

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
flow in coat and that's evident by how

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.970 
flow in coat and that's evident by how
wet<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.030> it's<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.140> chemical<00:04:31.470> game<00:04:31.800> with

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
wet it is it's a chemical game with

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.800 
wet it is it's a chemical game with
plastics<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.700> want<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> smooth<00:04:33.540> coat

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
plastics so we want to see a smooth coat

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.300 
plastics so we want to see a smooth coat
on<00:04:33.960> there<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.440> want<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> be<00:04:35.040> able<00:04:35.130> to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310
