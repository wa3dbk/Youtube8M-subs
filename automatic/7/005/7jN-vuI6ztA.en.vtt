00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.819 
use is this kinky curly custard that I
bought<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.469> Target<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> third<00:00:49.649> and

thing

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
thing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.600 
thing
let's<00:01:46.530> make<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> trail<00:01:48.350> okay<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:50.280> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
let's make a trail okay so I'm just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
let's make a trail okay so I'm just
going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.789> brush<00:01:51.000> through<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.539> think<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.259> also

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
going to brush through I think this also

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
going to brush through I think this also
helps<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.009> find<00:01:53.189> myself<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.759> turnout<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> little

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
helps to find myself a turnout a little

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.630 
helps to find myself a turnout a little
bit<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.689> after<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.289> put<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> product<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
bit more after I put the product in but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.070 
bit more after I put the product in but
if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.179> like<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> washing<00:01:57.689> doll

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
if you want to do like a washing doll

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.980 
if you want to do like a washing doll
put<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.679> product<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.250> then<00:01:59.429> just<00:01:59.610> head<00:01:59.789> out

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
put the product and then just head out

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
put the product and then just head out
that<00:02:00.990> works<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that works as well but I like to do this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.910 
that works as well but I like to do this
just<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> make<00:02:03.690> sure<00:02:04.039> if<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.220> curls<00:02:05.549> pop<00:02:06.920> okay

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
just to make sure if the curls pop okay

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:28.490 
just to make sure if the curls pop okay
let's<00:02:08.100> speed<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.369> up

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.710 

so<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:30.700> I'm<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:31.150> started<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
so now I'm going to get started with the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.620 
so now I'm going to get started with the
diffuser<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:33.130> about<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.550> sticky<00:02:33.819> goo

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
diffuser what about the sticky goo

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.840 
diffuser what about the sticky goo
button<00:02:35.260> right<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.280> cool<00:02:36.489> button

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
button right here is the cool button

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.520 
button right here is the cool button
virtually<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> same<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.020> heat<00:02:38.200> setting

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
virtually the same as the heat setting

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.910 
virtually the same as the heat setting
so<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:40.209> really<00:02:40.569> don't<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.230> hold<00:02:41.530> down<00:02:41.800> on

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
so you really don't have to hold down on

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.370 
so you really don't have to hold down on
anything<00:02:42.370> which<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.850> nice<00:02:43.060> as<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.230> high

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
anything which is nice as the high

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.280 
anything which is nice as the high
setting<00:02:46.590> first<00:02:47.590> part<00:02:47.920> takes<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.310> while<00:02:48.459> so

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
setting first part takes a while so

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.590 
setting first part takes a while so
tick-tock<00:02:50.290> -<00:02:52.590> hmm<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:54.910> gonna<00:02:55.090> put<00:02:55.510> it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
tick-tock - hmm you're just gonna put it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000

scalp and get as much hair as possible

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.710 
scalp and get as much hair as possible
I<00:02:59.709> don't<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.670> any<00:03:00.790> particular<00:03:01.090> order

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I don't do this in any particular order

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.080 
I don't do this in any particular order
I<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.680> kind<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> go<00:03:03.310> around<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.670> whole<00:03:03.790> head

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
I just kind of go around the whole head

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.170 
I just kind of go around the whole head
but<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.660> hold<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.350> each<00:03:05.530> part<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.160> about<00:03:06.340> 20

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
but I hold it to each part for about 20

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.030 
but I hold it to each part for about 20
seconds<00:03:07.630> or<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.380> then<00:03:08.500> I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
seconds or so and then I

00:03:09.040 --> 00:04:17.660 
seconds or so and then I
next<00:03:09.640> time<00:03:11.310> how<00:03:12.310> about<00:03:12.340> we

let's<00:04:32.800> give<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.550> up<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.970> little<00:04:34.210> bit<00:04:34.390> more

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.790 

okay<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:24.120> am<00:05:24.930> finally<00:05:25.740> done<00:05:26.250> oh<00:05:27.290> that's<00:05:28.290> about

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
okay I am finally done oh that's about

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.960 
okay I am finally done oh that's about
ten<00:05:29.340> minutes

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
ten minutes

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.730 
ten minutes
real<00:05:30.210> time<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:31.700> actual<00:05:32.700> defusing<00:05:33.180> part

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
real time the actual defusing part

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:45.250 
real time the actual defusing part
drives<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.100> old<00:05:35.310> name

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.680 

now<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.470> don't<00:05:46.860> often<00:05:47.130> use<00:05:47.400> my<00:05:47.700> diffuser<00:05:48.210> just

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
now I don't often use my diffuser just

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.410 
now I don't often use my diffuser just
because<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.260> just<00:05:49.410> takes<00:05:49.740> extra<00:05:50.520> time<00:05:50.550> more<00:05:51.390> of

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
because it just takes extra time more of

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.670 
because it just takes extra time more of
a<00:05:51.570> wash<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:51.990> go<00:05:52.080> pad<00:05:52.410> person<00:05:53.000> but<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:55.050> will<00:05:55.470> say

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
a wash and go pad person but I will say

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.280 
a wash and go pad person but I will say
that<00:05:55.890> it's<00:05:56.040> definitely<00:05:56.160> good<00:05:56.730> on<00:05:57.000> humid<00:05:57.990> days

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
that it's definitely good on humid days

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.280
