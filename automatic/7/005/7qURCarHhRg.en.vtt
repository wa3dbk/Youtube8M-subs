alright<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.380> do<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> new<00:00:02.370> spiral

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
alright I'm going to do a new spiral

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.280 
alright I'm going to do a new spiral
wrap<00:00:03.300> tutorial<00:00:03.589> and<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:06.049> believe<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.230> is

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
wrap tutorial and I believe this is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.070 
wrap tutorial and I believe this is
called<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.770> shotgun<00:00:08.429> spa<00:00:08.760> around<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
called a shotgun spa around and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.299 
called a shotgun spa around and
basically<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:11.150> is<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> spiral<00:00:12.690> wrap

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
basically what it is is a spiral wrap

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.109 
basically what it is is a spiral wrap
with<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.730> ploy<00:00:15.690> wrapping<00:00:16.230> around<00:00:16.850> one<00:00:17.850> hand

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
with the ploy wrapping around one hand

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.570 
with the ploy wrapping around one hand
rather<00:00:18.420> than<00:00:18.570> both<00:00:18.930> hands<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:20.279> way<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
rather than both hands and that way you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.189 
rather than both hands and that way you
get<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.680> longer<00:00:22.680> more<00:00:23.189> clean-looking<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.240> spiral

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
get a longer more clean-looking a spiral

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
get a longer more clean-looking a spiral
pattern<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:26.609> I'll<00:00:26.730> show<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> looks

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
pattern and I'll show you what it looks

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.580 
pattern and I'll show you what it looks
like<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.760> little<00:00:29.760> bit<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:33.350> can<00:00:34.350> order

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
like a little bit like that I can order

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.010 
like a little bit like that I can order
do<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.489> good<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> direction<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.870> can

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
do it really good in one direction I can

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.280 
do it really good in one direction I can
do<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.260> both<00:00:37.469> 02<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.660> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.719> sloppy<00:00:39.989> go

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
do it in both 02 but kind of sloppy go

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.940 
do it in both 02 but kind of sloppy go
in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.590> direction<00:00:42.469> but<00:00:44.600> anyways<00:00:45.950> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
in the other direction but anyways to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520 
in the other direction but anyways to
teach<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.960> close<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.090 

start<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> maybe<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.070> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
few spots to kind of get used to the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.359 
few spots to kind of get used to the
feeling<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:03.090> uh<00:01:03.979> basically<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> want

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to do in this by our appt is at the same

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
to do in this by our appt is at the same
time<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> would<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.860> hand<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.549> top

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
time that you would put one hand on top

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.230 
time that you would put one hand on top
of<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> other<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> normal<00:01:14.250> spy<00:01:14.670> wrap<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of the other in a normal spy wrap you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
of the other in a normal spy wrap you
want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.729> ploy<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.330> top<00:01:18.890> see<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
want to put just a ploy on top see I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
want to put just a ploy on top see I
just<00:01:20.220> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> point<00:01:20.939> my<00:01:21.060> fingers<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just kind of point my fingers out and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
just kind of point my fingers out and
then<00:01:22.790> lay<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.560> blame<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.770> point<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.159> top<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
then lay the blame I point on top and it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.080 
then lay the blame I point on top and it
that<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> only<00:01:27.869> wraps<00:01:28.110> around<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.590> hand

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
that way it only wraps around one hand

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
that way it only wraps around one hand
so<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> few<00:01:31.259> times<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so kind of do that a few times so you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
so kind of do that a few times so you
can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:34.970> lay<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.450> floyd<00:01:36.720> tether<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.320> top

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
can see just lay the floyd tether on top

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.210 
can see just lay the floyd tether on top
of<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.799> hand<00:01:38.070> instead<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.049> your<00:01:40.049> hand<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.860> top

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
of your hand instead of your hand on top

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.460 
of your hand instead of your hand on top
of<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.460> hand

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.320 

if<00:01:49.070> you're<00:01:49.280> doing<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.610> other<00:01:49.760> way<00:01:49.910> you'd<00:01:50.180> be

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
if you're doing the other way you'd be

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.960 
if you're doing the other way you'd be
the<00:01:50.480> opposite<00:01:50.960> point<00:01:51.200> either<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.490> opposite

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the opposite point either the opposite

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.850 
the opposite point either the opposite
hand<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:55.480> that's<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.080> pretty<00:01:57.500> much<00:01:57.590> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
hand so that's that and pretty much to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.300 
hand so that's that and pretty much to
get<00:01:58.010> out<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.990> whenever<00:01:59.990> its<00:02:00.350> twists<00:02:01.040> all

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
get out of it is whenever its twists all

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.830 
get out of it is whenever its twists all
the<00:02:01.520> way<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:01.790> kind<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.210> flip<00:02:02.450> your<00:02:02.570> hand<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the way up kind of flip your hand this

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
the way up kind of flip your hand this
way<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.860> give<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.220> good<00:02:04.370> flip<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.150> other

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
way and give it a good flip the other

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.710 
way and give it a good flip the other
way<00:02:08.020> she<00:02:09.020> do<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.229> for<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.150> the
