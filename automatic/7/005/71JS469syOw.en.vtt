tiffany<00:02:02.070> aqua<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.060> bit<00:02:03.210> more

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
tiffany aqua is just a little bit more

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.100 
tiffany aqua is just a little bit more
vibrant<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> feel<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.210> Paradise<00:02:06.600> aqua<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
vibrant I feel like the Paradise aqua is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
vibrant I feel like the Paradise aqua is
a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.619> dull<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.789> both

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a little bit more dull but they both

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.690 
a little bit more dull but they both
look<00:02:09.209> great<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.250> if<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.520> weren't

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
look great and if they weren't

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.150 
look great and if they weren't
side-by-side<00:02:12.450> you'd<00:02:12.720> probably

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
side-by-side you'd probably

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.000 
side-by-side you'd probably
that<00:02:13.400> they're<00:02:13.970> both<00:02:14.210> aqua<00:02:14.570> anyways<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.830> that's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
that they're both aqua anyways so that's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.250 
that they're both aqua anyways so that's
my<00:02:16.190> review<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.090> costume<00:02:17.540> ones<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.110> the
