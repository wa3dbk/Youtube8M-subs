responsive and not that hard to use
although<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.989> calling<00:00:43.410> through<00:00:43.739> the

shape just more you stood using the
other<00:00:50.010> hand<00:00:52.070> right<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:54.510> seeing

other hand right so what you're seeing
right<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:57.410> something<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.800> magical

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
right now is something really magical

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
right now is something really magical
that<00:01:00.600> uses<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.119> magical

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that uses a bit of you know magical

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.920 
that uses a bit of you know magical
stuff<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.310> how<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.610> already<00:01:08.909> explained<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> how

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
stuff I how I already explained it how

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.340 
stuff I how I already explained it how
it<00:01:10.110> works<00:01:10.409> basically<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.729> post<00:01:12.350> well

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it works basically in the post well

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
it works basically in the post well
those<00:01:14.189> who<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:14.970> those<00:01:15.659> who<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:15.990> under

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
those who don't have those who are under

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
those who don't have those who are under
developers<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.549> probably<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.450> what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
developers will probably don't know what

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
developers will probably don't know what
I'm<00:01:18.750> talking<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> table<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.689> stuff

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
I'm talking about the table but stuff

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
I'm talking about the table but stuff
how<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> works<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> description<00:01:23.400> because

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
how it works in the description because

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.660 
how it works in the description because
it<00:01:23.700> isn't<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.180> want<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> explain<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> here

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
it isn't really want to explain it here

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.679 
it isn't really want to explain it here
so<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.840> isn't<00:01:28.409> done<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.640> well<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so this isn't done all I can do well a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.319 
so this isn't done all I can do well a
moment<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.409> hour<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
moment this hour I can do it but but I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
moment this hour I can do it but but I
planning<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.810> create<00:01:34.280> special<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.549> framing

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
planning to create special see framing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
planning to create special see framing
tools<00:01:36.119> where<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.439> frame<00:01:37.710> using<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
tools where I can see frame using my

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.080 
tools where I can see frame using my
hand<00:01:38.840> mm-hmm<00:01:39.890> also<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.460> notice<00:01:41.610> as

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
hand mm-hmm also as you can notice as

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
hand mm-hmm also as you can notice as
you<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.540> ties<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> didn't<00:01:43.320> rotate<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you all know ties I didn't rotate the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
you all know ties I didn't rotate the
camera<00:01:43.890> well<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.689> haven't

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
camera well that's because I haven't

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.460 
camera well that's because I haven't
implemented<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.130> yet<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:49.110> probably

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
implemented that yet but I will probably

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.030 
implemented that yet but I will probably
come<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> good<00:01:50.579> idea<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.229> what<00:01:52.229> how

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
come up with a good idea how do what how

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
come up with a good idea how do what how
to<00:01:53.100> control<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.299> mean<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> rotate

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to control the I mean like how to rotate

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.039 
to control the I mean like how to rotate
it<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.579> moment<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.840> move

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it and the moment you just just move

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
it and the moment you just just move
your<00:01:58.200> hand<00:01:58.469> around<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.979> move<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> camera

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
your hand around to move the camera

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.469 
your hand around to move the camera
around<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.649> could<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:01.790> try<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.240> frame

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
around I could actually try to see frame

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.800 
around I could actually try to see frame
bricks<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.170> something<00:02:04.979> hard<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
bricks like this something hard to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.530 
bricks like this something hard to
create

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
create

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.800 
create
I<00:02:07.630> can<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:08.800> use<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.130> same<00:02:09.430> gold<00:02:10.119> i<00:02:10.390> use<00:02:10.600> for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
I can just use the same gold i use for

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.070 
I can just use the same gold i use for
camera<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:11.380> for<00:02:11.740> part<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:13.030> why<00:02:13.630> not<00:02:13.780> let's

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
camera just for part so why not let's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.120 
camera just for part so why not let's
check<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.380> out<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.560> could<00:02:17.920> find

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
check that out and you could find

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.170 
check that out and you could find
magical<00:02:18.610> hands<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.830> call<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:20.980> telepathy<00:02:21.820> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.300 

hope<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.330> enjoyed<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.890> pretty<00:02:27.010> fun

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
hope you enjoyed that it's pretty fun

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.300 
hope you enjoyed that it's pretty fun
well<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.450> moment<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.080> utterly<00:02:29.440> working

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
well at the moment it's utterly working

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.730 
well at the moment it's utterly working
too<00:02:30.580> great<00:02:30.990> first<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.140> all<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.410> will<00:02:32.560> probably

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
too great first of all I will probably

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.470 
too great first of all I will probably
implement<00:02:33.370> some<00:02:33.490> kind<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.730> great<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.390> it's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
implement some kind of great so it's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.740 
implement some kind of great so it's
easily<00:02:34.860> more<00:02:35.860> easier<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.820> align<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.510> thing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
easily more easier to align the thing

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.010 
easily more easier to align the thing
because<00:02:38.320> no<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.650> like<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:40.420> would<00:02:40.600> be<00:02:40.630> quite

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
because no it's like it would be quite

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.650 
because no it's like it would be quite
hard<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.530> something<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.390> yeah

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
hard to do something like this so yeah

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.140 
hard to do something like this so yeah
we'll<00:02:43.870> create<00:02:44.350> integrate<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.520> it's<00:02:45.670> not<00:02:45.910> too

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
we'll create integrate so it's not too

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.870 
we'll create integrate so it's not too
it<00:02:46.270> will<00:02:47.080> see<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.950> actually<00:02:48.280> feel<00:02:48.610> pretty

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
it will see it can actually feel pretty

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.530 
it will see it can actually feel pretty
good<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.690> already<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.320> mean<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.540> see

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
good with this already I mean it's see

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.640 
good with this already I mean it's see
I'm<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:55.290> well<00:02:56.490> now<00:02:57.490> homemade<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.090> doesn't

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
I'm like well now homemade so it doesn't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.040 
I'm like well now homemade so it doesn't
wobble<00:02:59.650> too<00:02:59.950> much<00:03:00.160> that's<00:03:01.120> why<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.420> that's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
wobble too much that's why it that's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.160 
wobble too much that's why it that's
what<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.350> like<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:04.000> didn't<00:03:04.420> want<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.989> move

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
what it's like you didn't want to move

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.760 
what it's like you didn't want to move
and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.560> moved<00:03:05.890> my<00:03:06.010> hand<00:03:06.370> slowly<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:08.170> yeah

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
and I moved my hand slowly because yeah

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.690 
and I moved my hand slowly because yeah
your<00:03:09.040> hand<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.489> probably<00:03:09.910> really<00:03:10.239> shaky<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
your hand is probably really shaky and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
your hand is probably really shaky and
we<00:03:12.700> are<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.120> offending<00:03:13.660> your<00:03:13.810> hand<00:03:14.080> up<00:03:14.440> high

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
we are not offending your hand up high

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.330 
we are not offending your hand up high
on<00:03:14.709> e<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.100> yeah<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.970> there<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:17.160> what<00:03:18.160> should

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
on e but yeah in there so what should

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.250 
on e but yeah in there so what should
try<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> place<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.450> thing<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:20.019> not<00:03:20.080> really

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
try to place this thing it's not really

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.340 
try to place this thing it's not really
accurate<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.340> why<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.489> need<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.850> grid

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
accurate this is why I need to grid

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.280 
accurate this is why I need to grid
implementation<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.870> also<00:03:25.870> one<00:03:26.080> more<00:03:26.110> thing

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
implementation and also one more thing

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.780 
implementation and also one more thing
is<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.880> doin<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.810> 14<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:29.950> it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
is that it doin it 14 like this it's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.410 
is that it doin it 14 like this it's
like<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.840> move<00:03:32.380> back<00:03:32.530> yeah<00:03:33.269> directions<00:03:34.269> are

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
like I move back yeah directions are

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.350 
like I move back yeah directions are
wrong<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:35.340> basically<00:03:36.340> those<00:03:36.760> around<00:03:37.060> for

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
wrong because basically those around for

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.860 
wrong because basically those around for
old<00:03:37.510> accesses<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.200> basically<00:03:38.799> from<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.459> side

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
old accesses to basically from this side

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.479 
old accesses to basically from this side
the<00:03:40.870> travel<00:03:41.170> probably<00:03:41.500> read<00:03:41.950> some<00:03:42.130> kind<00:03:42.340> of

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
the travel probably read some kind of

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.110 
the travel probably read some kind of
common<00:03:43.120> rail<00:03:43.390> relative<00:03:44.320> relative<00:03:45.120> movement

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
common rail relative relative movement

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.630 
common rail relative relative movement
thing<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.110> can<00:03:47.260> basically<00:03:47.440> change<00:03:48.370> the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
thing so it can basically change the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.720 
thing so it can basically change the
view<00:03:48.850> point<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.330> easily<00:03:49.870> move<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.440> part<00:03:50.730> but

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
view point and easily move the part but

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.870 
view point and easily move the part but
I<00:03:51.970> will<00:03:52.660> need<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.110> focus<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.739> later<00:03:54.010> for

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
I will need to focus on that later for

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.539 
I will need to focus on that later for
now<00:03:55.000> i<00:03:55.030> want<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.540> make<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.830> finish<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.250> camera

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
now i want to make to finish the camera

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.910 
now i want to make to finish the camera
thing<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.440> state<00:03:59.709> pretty<00:04:00.250> nice<00:04:00.459> i<00:04:00.820> think<00:04:01.920> at

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
thing and state pretty nice i think at

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.100 
thing and state pretty nice i think at
least<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.580> just<00:04:03.760> move<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.630> bricks

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
least you can just move your bricks

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.650 
least you can just move your bricks
around<00:04:05.260> telepathically

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.740 

it<00:04:09.350> feels<00:04:09.560> good
