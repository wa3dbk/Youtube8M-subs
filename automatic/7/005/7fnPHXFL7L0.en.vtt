recorded at 130 beats per minute I just

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.310 
recorded at 130 beats per minute I just
happen<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> music<00:00:36.059> bed<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.450> also<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
130 bpm and you'll see here that I've

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
130 bpm and you'll see here that I've
already<00:00:40.469> aligned<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> capella<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> match

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
already aligned the a capella to match

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.479 
already aligned the a capella to match
the<00:00:42.540> beats<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.829> track<00:00:44.219> C<00:00:44.550> b1<00:00:45.000> b2<00:00:45.510> b3

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
the beats there in that track C b1 b2 b3

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.680 
the beats there in that track C b1 b2 b3
b4<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.059> perfectly<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> sync

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
b4 so it's gonna be perfectly in sync

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
b4 so it's gonna be perfectly in sync
when<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> give<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.770> example<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.280> exactly

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
when I give you an example of exactly

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
when I give you an example of exactly
how<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.879> acapella<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> sounds<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.289> mixed

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
how an acapella can sounds when mixed

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.209 
how an acapella can sounds when mixed
over<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> music<00:00:53.760> track<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> same<00:00:54.360> bpm

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.439 

but<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> fun<00:00:59.460> doesn't<00:00:59.489> stop<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.300> you're

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
but the fun doesn't stop there if you're

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.760 
but the fun doesn't stop there if you're
editing<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.960> Adobe<00:01:01.320> Audition

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
editing in Adobe Audition

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
editing in Adobe Audition
you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> also<00:01:02.309> add<00:01:02.640> an<00:01:02.760> echo<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.600> match<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you can also add an echo to match the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
you can also add an echo to match the
beats<00:01:04.110> per<00:01:04.320> minute<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.890> tunes<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
beats per minute of your tunes so have a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.520 
beats per minute of your tunes so have a
look<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> example<00:01:06.510> I've<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.290> dragged

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
look at this example I've just dragged

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
look at this example I've just dragged
my<00:01:07.680> acapella<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.369> track<00:01:08.640> 3<00:01:08.909> which<00:01:09.150> already

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
my acapella into track 3 which already

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.590 
my acapella into track 3 which already
has<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> preset<00:01:10.200> effects<00:01:10.770> echo<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.390> set

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
has a preset effects echo and I've set

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590 
has a preset effects echo and I've set
it<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:13.070> 468<00:01:14.070> milliseconds<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> left

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it for 468 milliseconds on the left

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
it for 468 milliseconds on the left
channel<00:01:15.900> which<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.950> length<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.460> exactly

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
channel which is the length of exactly

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.740 
channel which is the length of exactly
one<00:01:18.090> beat<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.280> 936<00:01:20.280> milliseconds<00:01:21.000> double<00:01:21.509> for

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
one beat and 936 milliseconds double for

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
one beat and 936 milliseconds double for
6-8<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.770> channel<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.520> length<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
6-8 on the right channel the length of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
6-8 on the right channel the length of
two<00:01:24.180> beats<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> listen<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
two beats so now have a listen and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
two beats so now have a listen and
you'll<00:01:26.520> hear<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> capella<00:01:27.479> echoing<00:01:28.110> into

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you'll hear the a capella echoing into

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.780 
you'll hear the a capella echoing into
the<00:01:28.590> track<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> beat

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.399 

but<00:01:36.790> there's<00:01:37.000> even<00:01:37.060> more<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.869> can<00:01:37.900> do<00:01:38.170> with<00:01:38.200> an

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409

instance<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:51.970> might<00:01:52.000> decide<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.630> copy<00:01:52.840> say<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
instance I might decide to copy say the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.940 
instance I might decide to copy say the
first<00:01:54.190> bit<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> cappella<00:01:55.590> command<00:01:56.590> C<00:01:56.920> or

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
control C and then paste it in here here

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.490 
control C and then paste it in here here
here<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:02.979> here<00:02:03.689> all<00:02:04.689> on<00:02:04.869> beat<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.200> then<00:02:05.350> just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
here and here all on beat and then just

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.109 
here and here all on beat and then just
drag<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.740> out<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.190> get<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.520> very<00:02:06.789> start

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
drag that out so you get the very start

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.880 
drag that out so you get the very start
of<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> cappella<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:08.380> will<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> little

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
of the a cappella this will be a little

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.889 
of the a cappella this will be a little
stutter<00:02:09.190> going<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.390> track<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
stutter going into the track have a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.320 
stutter going into the track have a
listen<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.040> did<00:02:18.220> talk<00:02:18.400> about<00:02:18.430> stutter

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
listen and I did talk about stutter

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.270 
listen and I did talk about stutter
effect<00:02:19.510> at<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.900> end<00:02:20.049> so<00:02:20.380> how<00:02:20.680> about<00:02:20.799> this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
effect at the end so how about this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
effect at the end so how about this
little<00:02:21.519> effect<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.269> experiment

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
little effect you have to experiment

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.240 
little effect you have to experiment
really<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.440> these<00:02:23.590> stutters<00:02:23.980> because

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
really with these stutters because

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.910 
really with these stutters because
sometimes<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.819> sounds<00:02:25.090> fantastic<00:02:25.299> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
sometimes it sounds fantastic and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.890 
sometimes it sounds fantastic and
sometimes<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.069> sounds<00:02:27.299> absolutely<00:02:28.299> awful<00:02:28.450> but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
sometimes it sounds absolutely awful but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.490 
sometimes it sounds absolutely awful but
it's<00:02:29.049> quite<00:02:29.200> elongated<00:02:29.920> at<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> end<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.110> soul

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it's quite elongated at the end the soul

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.130 
it's quite elongated at the end the soul
goes<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.790> quite<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.970> while<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.959> just

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
goes on for quite a while so if I just

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.890 
goes on for quite a while so if I just
cut<00:02:35.380> there<00:02:35.680> half<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.130> beat<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.900> around

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
cut there half a beat there and around

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.699 
cut there half a beat there and around
half<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.380> beat<00:02:38.590> there<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.970> maybe<00:02:40.420> also<00:02:40.870> half<00:02:41.560> a

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
half a beat there and maybe also half a

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.220 
half a beat there and maybe also half a
beat<00:02:41.980> there<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.510> should<00:02:43.810> sound<00:02:44.079> pretty

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
beat there it should sound pretty

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.020 
beat there it should sound pretty
interesting<00:02:44.980> now<00:02:45.100> at<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> start<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.000> end

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
interesting now at the start and the end

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.500 
interesting now at the start and the end
of<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> cappella<00:02:46.750> let's<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.350> listen

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.880 

so<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> idea<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.350> how<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.590> works

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
so you get the idea of how that works

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.520 
so you get the idea of how that works
but<00:02:57.579> what<00:02:57.850> about<00:02:58.180> matching<00:02:58.989> your<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.140> cappella

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
but what about matching your a cappella

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.550 
but what about matching your a cappella
to<00:02:59.859> a<00:03:00.100> track<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.760> different<00:03:01.239> BPM<00:03:01.810> well<00:03:02.140> I've

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
to a track of a different BPM well I've

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.150 
to a track of a different BPM well I've
also<00:03:02.920> prepared<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.700> here's<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.209> bed<00:03:04.480> at

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
also prepared for that here's a bed at

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160 
also prepared for that here's a bed at
140<00:03:06.160> beats<00:03:06.400> per<00:03:06.609> minute<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.359> in<00:03:07.780> order<00:03:08.140> to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
140 beats per minute and in order to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.289 
140 beats per minute and in order to
match<00:03:08.410> your<00:03:08.620> acapella<00:03:09.040> let's<00:03:09.609> drag<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:09.940> into

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
match your acapella let's drag it into

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.229 
match your acapella let's drag it into
the<00:03:10.540> multi<00:03:10.840> track<00:03:11.109> again<00:03:11.620> for<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.579> new<00:03:12.910> track

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
the multi track again for this new track

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.569 
the multi track again for this new track
and<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:14.079> look<00:03:14.320> now<00:03:14.980> you'll<00:03:15.250> notice

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
and have a little look now you'll notice

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.160 
and have a little look now you'll notice
if<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:15.940> line<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.269> up<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.600> start<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.049> this

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
if I line this up at the start of this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.590 
if I line this up at the start of this
140<00:03:17.829> BPM<00:03:18.220> track<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.640> start<00:03:18.819> playing<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.269> it's

140 BPM track and start playing it it's

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.090 
140 BPM track and start playing it it's

not<00:03:24.100> quite<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.510> order<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.870> do<00:03:26.019> that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
not quite right so in order to do that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.250 
not quite right so in order to do that

I can see there I know that when that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.220 
I can see there I know that when that
bit<00:03:38.620> matches<00:03:39.069> up<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.549> bit<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.389> on<00:03:40.630> B
