00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.650
 Robert F. Muller is more than Robert Muller's economy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.549
 For the first time in his testimony before Congress yesterday that he has f_b_i_ 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.490
 In fact, UAVs are used for surveillance purposes within u_s_ 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.630
 This disclosure came in the middle of more efforts than obon 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.539
 Management to justify and control programs that were 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.250
 Though not surprisingly many have been made public through the releases 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.230
 Made by Edward Snowden over the last uh ... oh 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 Near the lactation period of time 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 Now the government has not previously acknowledged the use of drones on u_s_ and Mexico 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.400
 Borders and in isolated cases 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.760
 And Robert's molasses acceptance is the first time that f_b_i_ has publicly 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.550
 I admit using drums locally and this is some say that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.800
 This may have been done 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.130
 Sound amplifiers 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.920
 Edward Snowden of the shelving release more documents already published 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 Details on the use of drones in government surveillance programs of this kind 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.629
 By that in a sense 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.490
 This is certainly possible 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.830
 How the interrogation was uh ... Pretty clear Chuck Grassley on 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.520
 Said the Republican senator 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.150
 Is f_b_i_ alone 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.220
 You are currently using UAVs and if so for the purpose of what Molly replied yes and no 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.320
 Used for surveillance and went to add unmanned aircraft very rarely 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.550
 It is usually used in a particular incident when you need the capability 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.320
 He did not say anything about what those incidents he kind of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.800
 Reduce the importance of this 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 Saying it was really not a big deal that was interesting to share with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
 Democratic Senator for California Dianne Feinstein asked 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.230
 Or what privacy protection to use 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.840
 In the deployment of drones and storage of images collected drums 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.830
 Wah ... The director of f_b_i_ Molly concentrates their use narrowly on 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.600
 Specific accidents are rarely used too, and are usually used in particular 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.729
 Accident we need the ability 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.580
 He does not even know what happens to the photos that medications 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.090
 Take and they store 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.400
 By date deleted 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.249
 Between our reviews w then you are well 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.700
 It is possible that it is not deliberately said right, we know that this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.279
 Happens with the president and said that the president says he does not know 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.939
 Sometimes she does not deliberately said buttttt that it would be strange that no one 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.769
 He knows what happens to the pictures taken with the plunge back we kind of know 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.029
 This was happening on the issue 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.489
 Or the surprise here is not used there seems to be this wider lack of 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.650
 A specific policy that directs its uses that are articulated observations on what you do 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.969
 Think 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.239
 Well how do you think it is important to remember that many of these 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.299
 The techniques are pretty new as there are new communication technologies 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.809
 That people are using a mother ... you know the intelligence gathering changes 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.969
 As well as you have to know the obvious fact that after nineteen we passed 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.999
 It was a Patriot Act and we had a number of years not a single question anything 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.519
 Related to this fear of being labeled as a traitor or a traitor ... the right of money 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.029
 Now we finally have a discussion about what is reasonable and what is not given 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.239
 The current level of Lewis threat we know that this is ... uh American public opinion 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.249
 Do not have the right to know everything that is being done 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.619
 By the intelligence services but to be said 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:18.809
 Do you think there is a right to know what policy is on the use of drones 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.099
 We do not need to know every time you've used Rollins we do not need to know each 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.999
 The side of those who have been surveilled by drones 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.799
 The button gives us a sense of what the policy is 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.669
 Or even that in your mind legitimately classified 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.499
 You know we must certainly know politics but we also know that 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.409
 The government does everything possible 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.509
 To make sure that those policies have a very loose language and very vague 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.139
 Set deliberately early and they are going to do everything in their power to make 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.529
 Make sure that they can continue to use the transfer control I do not know for 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.749
 Crane have what is uh ... 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.499
 As you know it is clear and detailed as 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.269
 As concise as we want to live in relation to legislation on this there is no 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.689
 The question that you will not be satisfied with everyone is all that you have revealed 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.079
 The question is right and now we do not have much at all, he said it is too narrow 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.269
 Use in specific situations 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.329
 Point 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.809
 The truth does not satisfy many people
