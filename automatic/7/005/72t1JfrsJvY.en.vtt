he announced that they fell in five
userland<00:01:03.060> exploits<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> difference

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
userland exploits and the difference

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.280 
userland exploits and the difference
between<00:01:05.129> New<00:01:05.460> Zealand<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.909> hardware<00:01:06.329> is<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
between New Zealand and hardware is a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
between New Zealand and hardware is a
hardware<00:01:07.680> exploit<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.159> allow<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hardware exploit will allow I think it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
hardware exploit will allow I think it
any<00:01:10.320> former<00:01:10.710> apple<00:01:10.829> releases<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> device

any former apple releases to that device

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
any former apple releases to that device
I<00:01:12.030> believe<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.479> jailbroken<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.229> least<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I believe can be jailbroken at least as

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
I believe can be jailbroken at least as
a<00:01:13.799> tethered<00:01:14.310> jailbreak<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.970> believe<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> how

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
a tethered jailbreak I believe it's how

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
a tethered jailbreak I believe it's how
a<00:01:15.659> hardware<00:01:16.079> exploit<00:01:16.380> works<00:01:16.530> did<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a hardware exploit works did you just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.749 
a hardware exploit works did you just
land<00:01:17.520> exploits<00:01:17.970> work<00:01:18.859> only<00:01:19.859> for<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.249> specific

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
land exploits work only for a specific

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
land exploits work only for a specific
number<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.869> software<00:01:22.109> so<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:22.619> might<00:01:22.829> work

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
number of software so i might work

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.349 
number of software so i might work
falling<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.340> software<00:01:23.700> too<00:01:24.030> soft<00:01:24.270> for

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
falling one software too soft for

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.389 
falling one software too soft for
something<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.719> that<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.350> anyway<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
something like that but anyway in

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.450 
something like that but anyway in
example<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> userland<00:01:27.479> exploit<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.170> be

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
example of userland exploit would be

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
example of userland exploit would be
like<00:01:29.780> jailbreakme<00:01:30.780> i<00:01:30.899> think<00:01:31.109> they<00:01:31.170> had<00:01:31.289> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
like jailbreakme i think they had that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
like jailbreakme i think they had that
somewhere<00:01:31.740> near<00:01:32.009> yeah<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.329> got

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
somewhere near yeah right here they got

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.440 
somewhere near yeah right here they got
jailbreakme<00:01:34.020> uh<00:01:34.429> and<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.880> hardware<00:01:36.210> exploit

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
jailbreakme uh and a hardware exploit

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.489 
jailbreakme uh and a hardware exploit
would<00:01:36.569> be<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.749> the<00:01:36.840> line<00:01:36.960> would<00:01:37.109> exploit

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
would be like the line would exploit

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.980 
would be like the line would exploit
that<00:01:37.740> most<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.659> redsnow

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
that most of the like the the redsnow

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.499 
that most of the like the the redsnow
like<00:01:40.319> if<00:01:40.859> you<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.069> Breslin<00:01:41.429> right<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.700> wet

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
like if you use Breslin right now wet

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.660 
like if you use Breslin right now wet
jailbreaks<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.319> the<00:01:43.560> betas<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.039> iOS<00:01:44.249> 5<00:01:44.490> right

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
jailbreaks like the betas of iOS 5 right

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
jailbreaks like the betas of iOS 5 right
now<00:01:44.789> what<00:01:45.299> jailbreaks<00:01:45.659> toes<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.079> believe<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
now what jailbreaks toes I believe is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
now what jailbreaks toes I believe is
the<00:01:46.920> lime<00:01:47.069> we<00:01:47.219> export<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.909> lime<00:01:48.060> rain-x<00:01:48.569> boy<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the lime we export the lime rain-x boy I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.120 
the lime we export the lime rain-x boy I
believe<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.350> what's<00:01:49.560> doing<00:01:49.859> it<00:01:49.979> i'm<00:01:50.100> not

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
believe it's what's doing it i'm not

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.639 
believe it's what's doing it i'm not
positive<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.119> i<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.209> so<00:01:51.649> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
positive on that but i think so and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
positive on that but i think so and
that's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> hardware<00:01:53.280> exploit<00:01:53.639> so<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that's a hardware exploit so that you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
that's a hardware exploit so that you
can<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.539> that<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> temperature<00:01:55.229> break<00:01:55.549> on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
can do that as a temperature break on
