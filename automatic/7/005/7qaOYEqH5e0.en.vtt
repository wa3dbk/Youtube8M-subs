 city ​​of charlotte for what is going to be 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.619
 the second day of this group that 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.960
 stadium bank of america 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.390
 precisely this encounter between 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.940
 Mexicans and Cubans is the one that mostly 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.879
 has been speculated and talked about during these 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.550
 days because in the papers mexico luce 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.440
 far superior to a Cuba that was already 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.589
 thrashed on the opening day by 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.719
 Costa Rica 5 to 0 and Costa Rica was able to 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.940
 thrashing Cuba is expected mexico what 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.339
 do even with a wider marker 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.260
 in that sense the technical director of the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.049
 mexican selection josé manuel el chepo 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.869
 of the tower let know that respects a lot 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.170
 to its rivals and that it tries to avoid 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.299
 all coast fall into relaxations 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.740
 of trust with your group let's hear what 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.960
 what the chepo said at a conference 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.780
 press always 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.470
 the main enemy we are 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.470
 ourselves 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.310
 by the excess of confidence that can be 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.170
 produce 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 it's something that we have commissioned a lot 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.620
 we can not underestimate absolutely anything 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.570
 for 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.610
 and prepare as best we can 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.040
 as for its part of this challenge 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.320
 complicated not impossible before the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.030
 Mexicans the group has by now 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 completely digested what was the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 win on the opening day against 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 Costa Rica 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.369
 the group is united recovered and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.869
 they want to surprise mexico like this 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.150
 says its technical director raul 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.410
 gonzález and I think I do believe that the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.080
 first matches against against the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.340
 first in front of costa rica see as very 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.660
 early after we let look for a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 balance and good after the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.920
 second time if what happened happened not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
 we finished julia two but well I think that 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.410
 in a team I am that we are in a 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 training process I think this 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.430
 match against mexico is complicated not 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 it's savior's a little more to follow him 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.910
 for us as another of the collates 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 that will be presented in this double shift 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.350
 of the group here in charlotte city 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.480
 will be the duel between Costa Ricans and 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.640
 Salvadorans El Salvador says to be 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.310
 ready for this match against costa rica 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.950
 They know perfectly well that a victory 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.930
 could keep them food to aspire to 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.730
 classify to the next phase in that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.590
 felt his technical director the Uruguayan 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.970
 ruben israel says meet the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.990
 perfection 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.580
 volpe teams game 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.280
 and with the equipment of the blows always 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.480
 pop always propose already we know it in 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.820
 Mexico in Argentina 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.370
 has always proposed not in vain is the 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.280
 selector from a session 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.140
 important in Central America so my 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.700
 greatest respect are in costa rica ha 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.290
 had movement for two days but 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.360
 practically with zero access to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.890
 media the important thing that 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.410
 leaves the tico camp is the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.240
 full recovery of Bryan Ruiz the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.280
 front of the twente of holland that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.440
 could be in the lineup of Ricardo 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
 the volpe for the match against 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
 savior the big question then is 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.260
 for the technical director of the selection 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.270
 of Costa Rica who leave the bench 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.030
 of substitutes in case you want to use a 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.060
 bryan ruiz in the front tica álvaro 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.070
 saborío miguel ureña participated in the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.080
 thrashed against Cuba for what will be 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.970
 difficult for ricardo volpe choose in 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.710
 that sense is all we have for 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 now this was the report from 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.400
