I do on my iPhone or iPod here's a look

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.930 
I do on my iPhone or iPod here's a look
at<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> iOS<00:03:16.140> 7<00:03:16.440> multitasking<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.430> portrait

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
at the iOS 7 multitasking in portrait

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
at the iOS 7 multitasking in portrait
orientation<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:19.020> my<00:03:19.050> opinion<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
orientation and I in my opinion of this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.260 
orientation and I in my opinion of this
looks<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.130> lot<00:03:20.250> better<00:03:20.400> than<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.850> landscape

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
looks a lot better than the landscape

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.250 
looks a lot better than the landscape
orientation<00:03:21.420> which<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.230> weird

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
orientation which is a bit weird

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.990 
orientation which is a bit weird

considering generally you'll use your
iPad<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.560> landscape<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.520> as<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.820> see

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
iPad in landscape but as you can see

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.900
