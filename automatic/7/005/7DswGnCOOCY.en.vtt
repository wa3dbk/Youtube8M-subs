00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello friends greetings welcome in this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 occasion we are going to make a comparison of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.270
 performance between a 27-inch imac 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.380
 with an intel i7 quad-core to 4 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.090
 gigahertz with retina 5k screen with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 a mac pro of 4 cores to 37 gigahertz 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.310
 with double graphics card 300 s remember 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.310
 that this 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.770
 Four-core mack pro is the entrance 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.410
 to the macro world 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.950
 let's do the comparison first 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.050
 place we see here that in the cinema you see 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.480
 r-15 which is a program that analyzes you 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.960
 well in this case analyzing the render 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 3d with a single with a single copper with a 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.019
 single core 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:06.689
 we see that comparing with each other the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:08.820
 imac wins the mac but in this test in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.370
 the test with 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.900
 rendering also in 3-d 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.890
 we see that in multi core also the imac 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.940
 27 inch with retina 5k screen is 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.550
 also better than the map pro 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.530
 four-core 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.320
 we continue in test number 3 in 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.740
 final cut pro x 10 which is a program 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.070
 for video editing importing at 1080p 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.560
 pro res that is a video code we see 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:50.270
 here that also behaves better 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.430
 27-inch imac 5k compared to the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.520
 mac pro 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.190
 in the next test we see that in 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.670
 final cut pro 10 making an effect of 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.119
 render 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 we see that here in this case a slight 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 advantage in favor of more pro 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.769
 in the next test with open gl and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.239
 rendering we see that also here 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:26.250
 using the light program mark 2.1 open cl 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.530
 we see that the mac pro here exceeds the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.830
 imac 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.770
 in the next test 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:42.350
 in the game tom raider at 2560 x 1440 that 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.930
 the mac is faster 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.769
 the imac sorry the imac d 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.769
 5k 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.320
 we continue and we see the next test 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.820
 in another in this game the devil 3 we see 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.220
 that at a resolution of 2560 x 1440 in 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.130
 the frames per second 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.130
 the imac goes better too 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.440
 in the next test using a 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.720
 project to 1,920 by 1,080 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.910
 we see what 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.400
 indeed it is also better 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.099
 the in this case the mac pro 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.099
 would win the game to the imac 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.080
 in this test 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.080
 and using 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.200
 a network camera with a resolution of 4,820 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:53.240
 by 2,700 with a compression factor in 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:56.420
 pro res to 1920 x 1080 we see that here 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.640
 the imac with the da vinci program 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.010
 solve the there is more behaves better 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.010
 that the four-core macro 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.050
 in this test in this fex we see that 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.050
 the imac also behaves better 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.290
 that the macro 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.790
 and in this test in photoshop here we see 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.430
 why the photoshop using an image 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.100
 raul sample 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 to reduce the noise of it with 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.580
 photoshop 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.310
 the most pro gains slightly to the imac all 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.590
 this information is taken from this 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:50.590
 website that we see here and say that in 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.889
 these 11 tests 7 were won by the imac and 4 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.199
 the mac pro 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.199
 Well that's all a greeting for all
