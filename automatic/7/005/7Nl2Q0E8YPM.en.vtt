00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
hi again let's learn how to make 3d

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.160 
hi again let's learn how to make 3d
spinning<00:00:21.960> shapes<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.529> PowerPoint<00:00:23.990> there<00:00:24.990> are

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
spinning shapes in PowerPoint there are

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890 
spinning shapes in PowerPoint there are
three<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.800> easy<00:00:26.010> steps<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.720> your

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
three pretty easy steps first make your

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
three pretty easy steps first make your
object<00:00:28.429> second<00:00:29.429> add<00:00:29.720> animations<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.019> third

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
object second add animations and third

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.979 
object second add animations and third
create<00:00:32.369> layers<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.149> make<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> rotating

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
create layers to make the rotating

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.459 
create layers to make the rotating
effect<00:00:35.719> let's<00:00:36.719> start<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.140> making<00:00:37.350> our

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
effect let's start with making our

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.069 
effect let's start with making our
object<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.820> demo<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> simple

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
object for this demo I'll make a simple

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.290 
object for this demo I'll make a simple
cube<00:00:40.410> I'll<00:00:40.680> start<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> square<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
cube I'll start with a square and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.770 
cube I'll start with a square and
recolor<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> match<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.739> background<00:00:44.780> now

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
recolor it to match the background now

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.560 
recolor it to match the background now
we're<00:00:46.079> ready<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> 3d<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> shape

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
we're ready to make it 3d go to shape

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.799 
we're ready to make it 3d go to shape
styles<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.320> format<00:00:49.739> shape<00:00:50.449> let's<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
styles or format shape let's go to the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.229 
styles or format shape let's go to the
rotation<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.710> let's<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.309> 20<00:00:53.789> degrees

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
rotation and let's just put 20 degrees

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
rotation and let's just put 20 degrees
on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> X<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.079> 20<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> Y<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
on the X and 20 on the Y just so that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
on the X and 20 on the Y just so that
you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.610> better<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.180> depths<00:00:57.719> being

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you can better see the depths being

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.540 
you can better see the depths being
formed<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.899> go<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> format<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> change<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
formed now go to format and change the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
formed now go to format and change the
color<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> depths<00:01:03.570> I'll<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
color of the depths I'll make it a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
color of the depths I'll make it a
darker<00:01:05.010> purple

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
darker purple

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.290 
darker purple
and<00:01:06.800> you<00:01:07.800> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.370> as<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.700> increase<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
and you can see that as I increase the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.260 
and you can see that as I increase the
depth<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.840> square<00:01:10.200> becomes<00:01:10.680> 3d<00:01:13.820> I'll<00:01:14.820> make

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
depth the square becomes 3d I'll make

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
depth the square becomes 3d I'll make
the<00:01:15.390> depth<00:01:15.660> about<00:01:16.020> 200<00:01:16.680> points<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the depth about 200 points it's not a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
the depth about 200 points it's not a
perfect<00:01:18.390> cube<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.080> enough<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> show<00:01:19.560> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
perfect cube but good enough to show you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
perfect cube but good enough to show you
guys<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.160> effect<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:21.440> right<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
guys the effect all right so now it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.050 
guys the effect all right so now it's
got<00:01:23.190> our<00:01:23.280> object<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.000> ready<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> animate

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
got our object and are ready to animate

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060 
got our object and are ready to animate
the<00:01:27.060> ironic<00:01:27.600> thing<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> animations<00:01:28.830> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the ironic thing about the animations is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
the ironic thing about the animations is
that<00:01:29.220> they're<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.520> easier<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that they're actually easier in

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.290 
that they're actually easier in
PowerPoint<00:01:31.350> 2007<00:01:31.950> although<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> be

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
PowerPoint 2007 although they can be

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.410 
PowerPoint 2007 although they can be
done<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.630> 2010<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.259> well<00:01:34.410> in<00:01:35.150> 2007<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.180> should

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
done in 2010 as well in 2007 you should

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
done in 2010 as well in 2007 you should
add<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> flash<00:01:37.080> once<00:01:37.650> effect<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.550> your<00:01:38.670> cube

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
add a flash once effect to your cube

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.770 
add a flash once effect to your cube
make<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> last<00:01:39.869> between<00:01:40.170> about<00:01:40.700> 0.05<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> 0.1

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
make it last between about 0.05 and 0.1

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
make it last between about 0.05 and 0.1
seconds<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:44.190> it<00:01:44.340> start<00:01:44.640> after<00:01:44.850> previous

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
seconds and make it start after previous

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
seconds and make it start after previous
and<00:01:46.399> if<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.789> 2010<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.229> you'll

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and if you have 2010 like I do you'll

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.040 
and if you have 2010 like I do you'll
have<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.340> basically<00:01:50.670> recreate<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> flash

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
have to basically recreate the flash

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.650 
have to basically recreate the flash
effect<00:01:52.259> manually<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.729> adding<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> peer

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
effect manually by adding in a peer

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.520 
effect manually by adding in a peer
effect<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> disappear<00:01:57.360> effect<00:01:57.720> right

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
effect and then a disappear effect right

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.899 
effect and then a disappear effect right
after<00:01:59.070> it

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.060 

make<00:02:05.909> them<00:02:06.090> both<00:02:06.300> start<00:02:06.900> after<00:02:07.140> previous<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
make them both start after previous and

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.040 
make them both start after previous and
let's<00:02:08.399> make<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> delay<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> disappear

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
let's make the delay in the disappear

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.850 
let's make the delay in the disappear
effect<00:02:10.370> 0.08<00:02:11.370> seconds<00:02:12.530> okay<00:02:13.530> great<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
effect 0.08 seconds okay great and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.440 
effect 0.08 seconds okay great and
you'll<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.490> what<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> animation<00:02:15.209> effects

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you'll see what the animation effects

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
you'll see what the animation effects
will<00:02:15.660> look<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.020> after<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.500> finish<00:02:16.740> layering

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
will look like after we finish layering

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.820 
will look like after we finish layering
which<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.490> our<00:02:17.580> next<00:02:17.790> step<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.260> basically

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is our next step this is basically

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.590 
which is our next step this is basically
like<00:02:19.920> making<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> flipbook<00:02:20.820> where<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.420> move

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
like making a flipbook where you move

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.540 
like making a flipbook where you move
the<00:02:21.630> object<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.230> tiny<00:02:22.530> bit<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:22.950> every<00:02:23.310> layer

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the object a tiny bit with every layer

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.850 
the object a tiny bit with every layer
to<00:02:23.850> create<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.150> motion<00:02:24.570> effect<00:02:24.870> our<00:02:25.200> first

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to create a motion effect our first

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.620 
to create a motion effect our first
layer<00:02:26.100> will<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.970> two<00:02:27.000> dimensional

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
layer will just be the two dimensional

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.820 
layer will just be the two dimensional
square<00:02:27.900> actually

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
square actually

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.790 
square actually
so<00:02:29.190> let's<00:02:29.400> hide<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.880> depth<00:02:30.200> go<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> format

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
so let's hide the depth go to format

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.930 
so let's hide the depth go to format
shape<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> X<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.270> y<00:02:33.420> both<00:02:33.900> 0<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
shape and make the X and y both 0 so the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.440 
shape and make the X and y both 0 so the
depth<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.480> still<00:02:36.750> there<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.440> hidden<00:02:38.450> now

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
depth is still there just hidden now

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.210 
depth is still there just hidden now
let's<00:02:39.660> copy<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.230> square<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.739> start<00:02:40.890> rotating

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
let's copy the square and start rotating

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.010 
let's copy the square and start rotating
it<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.700> layers<00:02:41.989> go<00:02:42.989> back<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.380> format<00:02:43.800> shape

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.800 

and<00:02:46.710> actually<00:02:47.640> before<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.030> go<00:02:48.210> any<00:02:48.420> further<00:02:48.450> let

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and actually before I go any further let

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.360 
and actually before I go any further let
me<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.290> quickly<00:02:49.440> show<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.890> what<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
me just quickly show you what the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.510 
me just quickly show you what the
rotation<00:02:50.880> options<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.800> there's<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.950> X<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.490> Y

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
rotation options are there's the X the Y

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.640 
rotation options are there's the X the Y
and<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> Z<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.600> here's<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> motion<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and the Z and here's what the motion is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.410 
and the Z and here's what the motion is
for<00:02:55.830> each<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.040> them<00:02:56.310> what<00:02:56.880> I'll<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.210> showing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
for each of them what I'll be showing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.200 
for each of them what I'll be showing
you<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.870> how<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.050> do<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.670> 180-degree<00:02:59.670> turn<00:02:59.940> on

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
you is how to do a 180-degree turn on

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.320 
you is how to do a 180-degree turn on
the<00:03:00.300> X<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.620> time<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.330> 180-degree

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
the X and at the same time a 180-degree

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.310 
the X and at the same time a 180-degree
turn<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> Y

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
turn on the Y

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.170 
turn on the Y
so<00:03:04.800> hopefully<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.310> graphic<00:03:05.820> helps<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so hopefully this graphic helps you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.470 
so hopefully this graphic helps you
visualize<00:03:06.240> how<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.960> rotation<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.590> work<00:03:08.480> so

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
visualize how the rotation will work so

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.060 
visualize how the rotation will work so
to<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.870> motion<00:03:10.110> effect<00:03:10.530> we'll<00:03:10.770> rotate

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
to get that motion effect we'll rotate

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.400 
to get that motion effect we'll rotate
each<00:03:11.490> new<00:03:11.850> layer<00:03:12.060> by<00:03:12.390> 10<00:03:12.660> degrees<00:03:12.990> on<00:03:13.170> both<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
each new layer by 10 degrees on both the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.030 
each new layer by 10 degrees on both the
x<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.830> y<00:03:13.920> axis<00:03:13.950> now<00:03:15.320> it's<00:03:16.320> important<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.800> place

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
x and y axis now it's important to place

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.190 
x and y axis now it's important to place
it<00:03:17.280> exactly<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.940> top<00:03:18.300> by<00:03:18.540> using<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.990> guides

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it exactly on top by using the guides

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.500 
it exactly on top by using the guides
otherwise<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.490> won't<00:03:20.730> look<00:03:20.880> smooth<00:03:21.240> when<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
otherwise it won't look smooth when you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.690 
otherwise it won't look smooth when you
animate<00:03:21.870> it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
animate it

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.090 
animate it
okay<00:03:23.700> now<00:03:23.880> repeat<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.480> process<00:03:24.890> copy<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
okay now repeat the process copy the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.910 
okay now repeat the process copy the
object<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.820> go<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> format<00:03:27.300> shape<00:03:27.540> again

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
object and go to format shape again

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.440 
object and go to format shape again
increase<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.100> rotation<00:03:29.550> by<00:03:29.670> 10<00:03:29.940> degrees<00:03:30.270> on

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
increase the rotation by 10 degrees on

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.140 
increase the rotation by 10 degrees on
the<00:03:30.510> X<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.900> Y<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.380> again<00:03:32.250> place<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:32.850> exactly

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the X and Y and again place it exactly

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.430 
the X and Y and again place it exactly
on<00:03:33.780> top<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.440> last<00:03:34.650> layer<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:36.350> repeat<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
on top of the last layer and repeat the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.290 
on top of the last layer and repeat the
process<00:03:37.620> again<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.700> more<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:38.970> want<00:03:39.180> to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
process again the more you want to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.090 
process again the more you want to
rotate<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.870> more<00:03:40.110> layers<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.680> need<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.890> make

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
rotate the more layers you need to make

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.490 
rotate the more layers you need to make
and<00:03:41.540> don't<00:03:42.540> worry<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.810> won't<00:03:42.960> make<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.290> sit

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
and don't worry I won't make you sit

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.020 
and don't worry I won't make you sit
through<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.740> whole<00:03:43.770> thing<00:03:44.100> I'll<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.850> show

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
through the whole thing I'll just show

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.030 
through the whole thing I'll just show
you<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.420> more<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.930> then<00:03:46.140> I'll<00:03:46.290> speed<00:03:46.650> up<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
you one more and then I'll speed up the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.960 
you one more and then I'll speed up the
other<00:03:47.190> 14

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
other 14

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.750 
other 14
there<00:03:48.510> are<00:03:48.630> 19<00:03:49.140> layers<00:03:49.380> total<00:03:49.890> one<00:03:50.490> for<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
there are 19 layers total one for the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880 
there are 19 layers total one for the
first<00:03:50.940> square<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.570> then<00:03:51.690> 18<00:03:52.110> others<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.740> each

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
first square and then 18 others for each

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.860 
first square and then 18 others for each
10<00:03:53.250> degree<00:03:53.550> rotation<00:03:59.420> here's<00:04:00.420> what<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.660> looks

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
10 degree rotation here's what it looks

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.930 
10 degree rotation here's what it looks
like<00:04:01.020> when<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.230> have<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.740> layers<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.340> did

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
like when you have all the layers I did

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.700 
like when you have all the layers I did
increments<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.540> 10<00:04:03.750> degrees<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.470> one

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
increments of 10 degrees for this one

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.560 
increments of 10 degrees for this one
but<00:04:04.920> if<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.070> want<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.460> to<00:04:05.580> look<00:04:05.730> even<00:04:06.060> smoother

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
but if you want it to look even smoother

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.810 
but if you want it to look even smoother
you<00:04:06.720> can<00:04:06.870> do<00:04:06.960> increments<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.440> 5<00:04:07.680> degrees<00:04:08.130> but

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
you can do increments of 5 degrees but

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.490 
you can do increments of 5 degrees but
this<00:04:09.120> will<00:04:09.330> of<00:04:09.420> course<00:04:09.660> double<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> layers

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
this will of course double the layers

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.050 
this will of course double the layers
you'll<00:04:10.860> need<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.130> make<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.490> you'll<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.940> be

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you'll need to make so you'll have to be

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.330 
you'll need to make so you'll have to be
really<00:04:12.630> patient<00:04:12.870> note<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:13.920> for<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.160> very

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
really patient note that for the very

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.190 
really patient note that for the very
last<00:04:14.700> layer<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.630> remove<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
last layer you want to remove the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.020 
last layer you want to remove the
disappear<00:04:16.739> animation<00:04:17.310> if<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.489> want<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> cube

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
disappear animation if you want the cube

disappear animation if you want the cube
to<00:04:18.299> stay<00:04:18.570> at<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> end<00:04:19.049> by<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.040> way<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
rectangles didn't start numbering at 1

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.110 
rectangles didn't start numbering at 1
for<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.470> for<00:04:22.680> some<00:04:22.770> reason<00:04:22.830> which<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.340> why<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
for me for some reason which is why the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.090 
for me for some reason which is why the
numbers<00:04:24.540> there<00:04:24.780> are<00:04:24.810> higher<00:04:25.170> than<00:04:25.380> 19<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
numbers there are higher than 19 and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.180 
numbers there are higher than 19 and
here's<00:04:27.000> your<00:04:27.150> final<00:04:27.540> animation<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.920> can<00:04:29.070> of

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
here's your final animation you can of

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.190 
here's your final animation you can of
course<00:04:29.460> play<00:04:29.700> around<00:04:30.060> with<00:04:30.270> how<00:04:30.420> fast<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:31.020> goes

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
course play around with how fast it goes

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320 
course play around with how fast it goes
the<00:04:31.500> rotation<00:04:32.040> angles<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.730> different<00:04:32.880> shapes

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the rotation angles and different shapes

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.660 
the rotation angles and different shapes
as<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.780> saw<00:04:33.960> at<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> beginning<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.710> one

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
as you saw at the beginning and one

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.250 
as you saw at the beginning and one
other<00:04:35.880> thing<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.360> keep<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.600> mind<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:37.080> this

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
other thing to keep in mind is this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.930 
other thing to keep in mind is this
layering<00:04:37.560> technique<00:04:38.130> can<00:04:38.340> be<00:04:38.460> used<00:04:38.730> for

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
layering technique can be used for

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.210 
layering technique can be used for
drawings<00:04:39.420> as<00:04:39.600> well<00:04:39.780> for<00:04:40.560> example<00:04:40.650> when<00:04:41.100> you

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
drawings as well for example when you

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.400 
drawings as well for example when you
layer<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.700> flower<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.450> looks<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.810> lot<00:04:43.080> like

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
layer the flower it looks a lot like

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.399 
layer the flower it looks a lot like
petals<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.460> back

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
petals in the back

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.200 
petals in the back
the<00:04:47.409> Sun<00:04:47.650> rotation<00:04:48.129> also<00:04:48.490> creates<00:04:48.879> a<00:04:48.970> really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
the Sun rotation also creates a really

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.460 
the Sun rotation also creates a really
neat<00:04:49.389> effect<00:04:51.509> well<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.990> pretty<00:04:53.289> much

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
neat effect well and that pretty much

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.219 
neat effect well and that pretty much
wraps<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:54.009> up<00:04:54.750> thanks<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.810> lot<00:04:55.930> for<00:04:56.080> watching

wraps it up thanks a lot for watching
hopefully<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.949> learn<00:04:57.099> something<00:04:57.460> new<00:04:57.639> and

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
hopefully you learn something new and

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.900 
hopefully you learn something new and
