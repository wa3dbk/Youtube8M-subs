00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
did this week rounded ourselves so we

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.009 
would fry either the new or old drive
with<00:02:08.289> static<00:02:08.679> electricity<00:02:09.360> all<00:02:10.360> we're<00:02:10.630> doing

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
with static electricity all we're doing

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.770 
with static electricity all we're doing
is<00:02:11.170> just<00:02:11.489> loosing<00:02:12.489> these<00:02:12.670> two<00:02:12.910> screws<00:02:13.360> here

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.860

go up to higher capacity and/or you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.720 
go up to higher capacity and/or you
could<00:02:48.849> put<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.299> SSD<00:02:50.370> which<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.519> what

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
could put in this SSD which is what

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.330 
could put in this SSD which is what
we're<00:02:51.940> doing<00:02:52.090> here<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.840> our<00:02:52.989> demo<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:54.190> of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
we're doing here in our demo but of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.069 
we're doing here in our demo but of
course<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.819> doesn't<00:02:55.360> really<00:02:55.480> matter<00:02:55.780> whether

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
course it doesn't really matter whether

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.309 
course it doesn't really matter whether
this<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.799> an<00:02:56.890> SSD<00:02:57.220> or<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.420> instructions<00:02:59.200> would

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
this is an SSD or not instructions would

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.530 
this is an SSD or not instructions would
be<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.620> same<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.190> we're<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.450> to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
be the same so we're just going to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.509 
be the same so we're just going to
remove<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.110> four<00:03:02.349> screws<00:03:02.380> here<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.160> see<00:03:03.370> that

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
remove the four screws here you see that

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.970 
remove the four screws here you see that
we<00:03:03.640> pulled<00:03:04.000> our<00:03:04.329> drive<00:03:04.920> very<00:03:05.920> easily<00:03:07.530> out<00:03:08.530> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
we pulled our drive very easily out it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.080 
we pulled our drive very easily out it
wasn't<00:03:09.280> even<00:03:09.970> screwed<00:03:10.750> down<00:03:11.019> in<00:03:11.380> here

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
wasn't even screwed down in here

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.300 
wasn't even screwed down in here
basically<00:03:13.560> once<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.709> remove<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.010> panel

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
basically once you remove the panel

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.520 
basically once you remove the panel
there's<00:03:15.700> nothing<00:03:16.060> else<00:03:16.209> holding<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.290> place

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
there's nothing else holding it in place

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.610 
there's nothing else holding it in place
you<00:03:17.799> just<00:03:17.829> have<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.310> remove<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.700> bracket<00:03:19.620> here

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
you just have to remove the bracket here

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.110 
you just have to remove the bracket here
by<00:03:21.010> pulling<00:03:21.730> out<00:03:21.790> these<00:03:22.030> four<00:03:22.359> screws<00:03:24.120> really

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
by pulling out these four screws really

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.440 
by pulling out these four screws really
really<00:03:26.160> simple<00:03:27.900> pull<00:03:28.900> out<00:03:29.250> these<00:03:30.250> four<00:03:30.760> little

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
really simple pull out these four little

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.510 
really simple pull out these four little
screws

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.980

here<00:03:59.240> for<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.540> serial<00:03:59.900> ata<00:04:00.200> want<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.220> make

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
here for the serial ata want to make

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.360 
here for the serial ata want to make
sure<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.850> smaller<00:04:02.450> connector<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.500> if<00:04:04.220> it

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
sure that the smaller connector is if it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.690 
sure that the smaller connector is if it
is<00:04:04.580> facing<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.950> that's<00:04:07.340> how<00:04:07.520> it's

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
is facing you because that's how it's

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.140 
is facing you because that's how it's
going<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.000> align<00:04:08.240> with<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.600> serial<00:04:08.990> ata<00:04:09.290> port

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
going to align with the serial ata port

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590 
going to align with the serial ata port
on<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.420> laptop<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.000> hold<00:04:14.270> it<00:04:14.420> like<00:04:14.570> that

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
on the laptop so you hold it like that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.900 
on the laptop so you hold it like that
and<00:04:15.110> you're<00:04:15.260> going<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.800> obviously<00:04:16.070> slide<00:04:16.730> it

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
and you're going to obviously slide it

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.430 
and you're going to obviously slide it
into<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.239> mounting<00:04:17.780> bracket

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
into the mounting bracket

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.699 
into the mounting bracket
and<00:04:19.250> screw<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.570> notice<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.109> most

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
and screw it in so you notice in most

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.620 
and screw it in so you notice in most
cases<00:04:21.980> that<00:04:22.130> means<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.610> sticker<00:04:22.970> is<00:04:23.240> going<00:04:23.510> to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
cases that means the sticker is going to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.720 
cases that means the sticker is going to
be<00:04:23.780> side<00:04:24.680> down<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:26.000> course<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:27.490> teeth<00:04:28.490> of
