00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
donut look at this thing that's got to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.779 
donut look at this thing that's got to
be<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:27.650> twelve<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> fifteen<00:00:28.890> regular<00:00:29.460> Donuts

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
be like twelve to fifteen regular Donuts

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.160 
be like twelve to fifteen regular Donuts
I'd<00:00:29.970> say<00:00:30.119> closer<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> fifteen<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.929> weighs<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
I'd say closer to fifteen it weighs a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.420 
I'd say closer to fifteen it weighs a
good<00:00:31.590> three<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.520> four<00:00:32.610> pounds<00:00:33.090> macros

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
good three or four pounds macros

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
good three or four pounds macros
infinity<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> challenge

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
infinity so this will be the challenge

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
infinity so this will be the challenge

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.680 

so<00:01:03.379> this<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.770> just<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.040> comparison<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.690> donor

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
so this is just a comparison of donor

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.590 
so this is just a comparison of donor
I'm<00:01:05.869> about<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.229> eat<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:07.729> normal<00:01:08.240> glazed

I'm about to eat and a normal glazed
doughnut<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.790> obviously<00:01:10.790> quite<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.299> difference

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.270 

literally<00:01:15.320> don't<00:01:15.590> even<00:01:15.740> know<00:01:15.920> how<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.130> like

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
literally don't even know how to like

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.960 
literally don't even know how to like

hold this thing

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.810 
hold this thing
so<00:01:17.119> first<00:01:17.390> bite<00:01:20.710> by<00:01:21.710> far<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.640> best

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
so first bite by far like the best

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.600 
so first bite by far like the best
entrance<00:01:23.149> in<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.300> world<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:25.220> isn't<00:01:25.520> going

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
entrance in the world this isn't going

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.510 
entrance in the world this isn't going
to<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:25.759> much<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.119> challenge<00:01:26.509> because<00:01:26.690> I<00:01:27.520> have

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
to be much of a challenge because I have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.880 
to be much of a challenge because I have
to<00:01:28.640> put<00:01:28.729> an<00:01:28.850> appetite<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.659> eat<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:29.930> lot<00:01:30.080> but

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
to put an appetite now you eat a lot but

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:41.310 
to put an appetite now you eat a lot but
it's<00:01:31.009> gonna<00:01:31.160> be<00:01:31.250> fun<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.750> I'll<00:01:32.750> make<00:01:33.020> this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.529 

thing<00:01:42.320> about<00:01:42.500> rounding<00:01:42.830> off<00:01:42.890> Donuts<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.539> your

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
thing about rounding off Donuts is your

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.219 
thing about rounding off Donuts is your
really<00:01:44.780> dense<00:01:45.429> so<00:01:46.429> like<00:01:46.929> John<00:01:47.929> something's

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
really dense so like John something's

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.469 
really dense so like John something's
not<00:01:48.320> super<00:01:48.679> light<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.009> fluffy<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:49.479> it's

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
not super light and fluffy but it's

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.570 
not super light and fluffy but it's
filling

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.760

super Joey by the inside

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
super Joey by the inside
I<00:02:01.820> guess<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.210> big<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.740> try<00:02:04.740> harder<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I guess it's so big I try harder to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.210 
I guess it's so big I try harder to
bacon<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.640> normal<00:02:06.090> donuts<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.100> not

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
bacon like normal donuts but it's not

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
bacon like normal donuts but it's not
like<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.490> inside<00:02:08.759> sort<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.240> Center<00:02:09.479> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like in the inside sort of Center it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.580

not super fluffy

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
not super fluffy
it's<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.220> dense<00:02:14.330> still<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> best

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
it's like dense still like the best

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:46.999 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:51.910 

my<00:02:47.999> stomach<00:02:48.299> starting<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.749> weird<00:02:49.049> noises

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.149 

this<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.040> probably<00:02:53.219> be<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.459> last<00:02:53.790> done<00:02:54.060> it

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
this will probably be my last done it

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.160 
this will probably be my last done it
for<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.189> few<00:02:56.370> weeks

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.520 

all<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:00.800> half<00:03:00.980> way<00:03:03.670> car<00:03:04.670> take<00:03:04.819> me<00:03:04.940> like<00:03:05.530> five

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
all right half way car take me like five

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.380 
all right half way car take me like five
five<00:03:07.400> minutes<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.850> had<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> guess<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
five minutes so if I had to guess the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:25.590 
five minutes so if I had to guess the
macros<00:03:15.730> I'd<00:03:16.730> say<00:03:20.110> maybe<00:03:21.110> 150<00:03:21.770> grams<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.100> fat

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.370 

500<00:03:26.600> grams<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> carbs<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:29.420> trace

protein<00:03:33.220> stomach<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.370> making<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> weirdest

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
protein stomach is making the weirdest

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.979 
protein stomach is making the weirdest
noises<00:03:42.970> any<00:03:43.970> bellies<00:03:44.239> donuts<00:03:44.570> compared<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.959> a

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
noises any bellies donuts compared to a

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.720 
noises any bellies donuts compared to a
lot<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.200> others<00:03:45.850> if<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.280> don't<00:03:49.370> eat<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.580> a

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
lot of others if if you don't eat it a

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.790 
lot of others if if you don't eat it a
day<00:03:49.880> after<00:03:50.209> because<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.900> icing<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.680> so

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
day after because this icing is so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.670 
day after because this icing is so
different<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.550> dries<00:03:53.000> out<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:54.470> literally

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
different it dries out so you literally

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.089 
different it dries out so you literally
have<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:54.950> eat<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.400> same<00:03:55.580> day

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.979 

so<00:04:03.819> maybe<00:04:03.969> maybe<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.109> quarter<00:04:05.349> left<00:04:06.840> stomach<00:04:07.840> is

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
so maybe maybe a quarter left stomach is

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:21.080 
so maybe maybe a quarter left stomach is
like<00:04:08.790> continuously<00:04:09.790> making<00:04:10.689> noises

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.740 

maybe<00:04:22.090> they<00:04:22.240> fill<00:04:22.449> them<00:04:22.630> up<00:04:22.780> like<00:04:24.240> -<00:04:25.240> that's<00:04:25.539> up

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
maybe they fill them up like - that's up

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.550 
maybe they fill them up like - that's up
to<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.930> half<00:04:26.110> done<00:04:26.320> its<00:04:26.470> left<00:04:29.639> and<00:04:30.639> I'm<00:04:30.759> sure

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
to a half done its left and I'm sure

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.670 
to a half done its left and I'm sure
after<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:32.650> will<00:04:32.919> be<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.310> sugar<00:04:34.000> high<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.560> then

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
after this will be a sugar high and then

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.529 
after this will be a sugar high and then
a<00:04:35.770> crash<00:04:41.400> it's<00:04:42.400> actually<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.910> lot<00:04:43.210> harder<00:04:43.240> and

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
a crash it's actually a lot harder and

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.450 
a crash it's actually a lot harder and
quality<00:04:43.900> B<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.789> didn't<00:04:45.789> see<00:04:45.880> my<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.030> lot<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.300> food
