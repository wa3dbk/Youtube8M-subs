alright<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.230> power<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.829> you<00:03:58.099> have<00:03:58.220> the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
alright and to power this you have the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.930 
alright and to power this you have the
six<00:03:59.420> pin<00:03:59.630> connector<00:04:00.170> right<00:04:00.380> here<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:01.099> think<00:04:01.760> you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
six pin connector right here I think you

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.430 
six pin connector right here I think you
can<00:04:02.090> see<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.450> yes<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:04.209> my<00:04:05.560> PSU<00:04:06.560> came<00:04:07.040> with<00:04:07.370> a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
can see that yes and my PSU came with a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.809 
can see that yes and my PSU came with a
corresponding<00:04:09.700> input<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.100> as<00:04:13.310> simple

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
corresponding input and it is as simple

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.710 
corresponding input and it is as simple
as<00:04:14.980> connecting<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.340> voila<00:04:17.829> should<00:04:18.829> have<00:04:18.950> power

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
as connecting it voila should have power

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.070 
as connecting it voila should have power
all<00:04:20.720> that's<00:04:21.620> left<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:21.950> do<00:04:22.310> now<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.870> take<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
all that's left to do now is take the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.640 
all that's left to do now is take the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
software that came with it and next time

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.090 
software that came with it and next time
you<00:04:27.830> turn<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.190> on<00:04:29.169> follow<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.440> directions<00:04:30.740> and

you turn it on follow the directions and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.040 
you turn it on follow the directions and
it<00:04:31.280> should<00:04:31.460> install<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:31.910> drivers<00:04:32.240> for<00:04:32.450> you
