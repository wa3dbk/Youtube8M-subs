00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.940
 hello today I will explain how the 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.940
 gearshift 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.920
 here 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.920
 as in almost most cars 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.670
 for the sequence of march to the castle 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.880
 same 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.930
 almost always goes first up second 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.790
 down third third up fourth down fifth 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.579
 up the recoil that in reverse 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.130
 work 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.960
 Well, how are changes made? 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.900
 we're going our range 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.420
 with the left foot we tread thoroughly 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.530
 and we go to our our lever 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 march and then to put the first 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.690
 we just have to throw a little 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.690
 towards us and up 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840
 so 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.430
 to change to the second gear 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 would be 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 and not our speedometer 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 and then here we have the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.900
 revolution counter and our 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.250
 speedometer 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.250
 to change gears 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 it is usually car religion 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.350
 will always go around a thousand revolutions 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.440
 thousand-odd reductions or maybe a little 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.510
 lower good 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 as it is a diesel car normally 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.140
 and the gear change is done 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.100
 normally from 1,500 to 2,000 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.420
 revolutions 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.290
 that is, it would be between 1502 thousand revolutions 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.200
 a little more then yes yes it is an eagle we 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.149
 catch on uphill slope by itself 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.060
 we can accelerate a little over two thousand 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.190
 revolutions is fine but between the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.539
 1,500 2,000 revolutions this one comes 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.520
 doing makes the change 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.040
 well then when we have 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.680
 stepped on the accelerator and we have already in 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 3500 2,000 revolutions 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.849
 we go to our marching levers 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.370
 and we just have to pull towards 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.260
 but down to a little bit different 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.790
 towards us, that is, it would be like this 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.689
 OK 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.689
 for third 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.450
 equally when we have our 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.270
 our revolutions account between 1502 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.700
 thousand revolutions 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.890
 it's not going to ride gear lever we step 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.740
 clutch always treading clutch suede 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.630
 the change in progress and to put third 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.750
 would be 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.750
 dead center and up to the rest 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.069
 for 4a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.050
 same 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.350
 Deadpoint 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.880
 and straight down 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.010
 for 5a 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.680
 a little bit dead 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.850
 a little bit to the right and towards 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.580
 above 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.070
 OK 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.460
 we go with the march back the march 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:27.300
 back already says that it is below the 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.500
 fifth as he gets well 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.420
 this car itself 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.250
 it is very simple what it removes or 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.060
 a little to the right 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.060
 and down 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 that would be reversing 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.970
 in other cars the reverse 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 can have a button here next to a 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.100
 lever that better goes up 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.180
 or there are cars that the lever has to be 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.209
 throw down 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 would for example throw down and 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.370
 then come to our retreat 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.560
 that this process 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.409
 or if you have a button because we had the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.360
 button we did not have our process or if 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.570
 you have a lever that you have to upload 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.920
 upwards same 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.430
 well, this is 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.310
 how the gear changes are made 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.090
 simply that always remember that the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.300
 Clutch foot reaches well to step 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 thoroughly and never half a clutch or anything 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.630
 of that because when you put in the 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.100
 lever 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.420
 it will cost us face work and that is very 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.129
 bad for the gearbox always the 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.149
 clutch foot thoroughly 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.149
 and that's it
