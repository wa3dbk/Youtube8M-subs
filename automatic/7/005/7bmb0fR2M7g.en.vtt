00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
- Summer's almost here,
which means a lot of kids

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.200
will be playing outside
in the sun,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.700
and I just read that only
25% of children

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.733
use sun protection regularly.

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.033
That's--that's not good.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.333
I don't have kids.
I choose to have free time

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.000
and quiet, relaxing evenings,
[audience laughter]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.966
but for those of you who do
have children,

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.066
I know it must be hard to get
them to wear sunscreen,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.366
so I came up with an invention,

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.100
and Andy is going to help
show you how to work it.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.266
Andy, come on out.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:31.266
[music plays]
[cheers and applause]

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.300
[audience laughter]
[music continues]

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.000
[audience claps along]
[music continues]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200
(audience) Whoo!

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.533
All right.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.566
Wonderful, all right.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.066
Let me explain how this works.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.500
You put your kids in
this machine.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.900
Don't worry, it's safe.
And, uh--

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.733
And then what happens is,
uh, this.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.733
[audience laughter]

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.500
[laughter and applause]

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.866
You're good to go.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.200
No concern about sunburn.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.833
You're covered in the sunblock,
which is good.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.733
It looks a little complicated,
so don't worry,

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.066
there's another option,
and, uh--so here's what it is.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.733
Pure Sun Defense protects you
and your children with SPF 50.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.233
Your kids are going to love it
'cause it features

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.233
their favorite
Disney and Marvel characters,

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.466
and you're going to love it
'cause it's very easy to use.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.533
Let me show you how.
Jason, come on out here.

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.133
[audience murmurs]
Oh!

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.733
[audience laughter]
You just gonna get in the pool?

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.066
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.933
So Jason is covered now with--
does that smell good?

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.000
- Really good.
- Yep.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.800
And it's nice, because

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.533
you don't have to worry about
anything at all.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:43.300
[audience laughter]

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.500
Completely--
good, right?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.466
- Really good.
- Okay, do you need more?

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.500
[audience laughter]
Okay.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.700
- Great, see?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.166
And look how much fun
he's having.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.333
[audience laughter]

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.700
- Would you like more?
- Yes, please.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.600
- Okay, great.
All right.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.333
Pure Sun Defense
wants you and your kids

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.700

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.266
so you're all going to get
a $150 Target gift card

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.400
so you can go and--
[cheers and applause]

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.566
[cheers and applause]
