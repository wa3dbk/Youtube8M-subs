last week I went to some seminars and I

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
last week I went to some seminars and I
attended<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.430> event<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
attended an event and it was a really a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.930 
attended an event and it was a really a
week<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.590> big<00:00:19.770> learning<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.460> me<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
week of big learning for me but it

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.420 
week of big learning for me but it
brought<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.810> phrase<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.770> that<00:00:22.800> concept<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
brought that phrase or that concept of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.320 
brought that phrase or that concept of
less-is-more

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
less-is-more

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.720 
less-is-more
into<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.200> bit<00:00:25.320> more<00:00:25.500> clarity<00:00:25.860> for<00:00:26.130> me<00:00:26.190> so

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
into a little bit more clarity for me so

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.320 
into a little bit more clarity for me so
I<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.119> started<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.350> how<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.430> focusing

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
I really started to see how by focusing

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.990 
I really started to see how by focusing
on<00:00:30.480> less<00:00:30.750> by<00:00:31.410> focusing<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.669> smaller

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
on less by focusing on the smaller

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
on less by focusing on the smaller
things<00:00:33.359> and<00:00:33.629> sometimes<00:00:34.230> by<00:00:34.410> simply<00:00:34.829> doing

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
things and sometimes by simply doing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700 
things and sometimes by simply doing
less<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:37.020> bigger<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
less we actually can get bigger and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.270 
less we actually can get bigger and
better<00:00:37.950> results<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.440> share<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
better results so I'm gonna share one of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
better results so I'm gonna share one of
those<00:00:41.489> small<00:00:42.090> things<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.470> today's

topics that they both spoke on was the
idea<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.759> breathing<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.780> giving<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> little

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
idea of breathing and giving a little

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.609 
idea of breathing and giving a little
bit<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.460> attention<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.299> awareness<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.229> how

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
bit more attention and awareness to how

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
bit more attention and awareness to how
we<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:11.010> breathing<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.479> how<00:01:12.780> our

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we are breathing and to how our

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
we are breathing and to how our
breathing<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.610> relax<00:01:14.970> us<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.810> do

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
breathing can really relax us and can do

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
breathing can really relax us and can do
things<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:17.010> our<00:01:17.190> position<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.390> our

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
things to our position and to our

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.330 
things to our position and to our
balance<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> big

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
balance that really make a big

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
balance that really make a big
difference<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.030> breathing<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> pretty

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
difference so breathing is a pretty

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
difference so breathing is a pretty
little<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.610> pretty<00:01:23.820> simple<00:01:24.780> thing

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
little thing it's a pretty simple thing

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740 
little thing it's a pretty simple thing
to<00:01:25.290> focus<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.909> such<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> huge

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
to focus on but it can have such a huge

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
to focus on but it can have such a huge
impact<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:28.860> gonna<00:01:29.010> do<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.400> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
impact so what I'm gonna do is just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.820 
impact so what I'm gonna do is just
share<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.350> insights

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
share with you some of the the insights

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.770 
share with you some of the the insights
or<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> takeaways<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.540> had<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
or the takeaways that I have had on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
or the takeaways that I have had on
breathing<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:35.070> always<00:01:35.580> focused<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
breathing I've always focused a lot on

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.570 
breathing I've always focused a lot on
my<00:01:36.509> breathing<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> feel<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
my breathing but I feel like I've you

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.070 
my breathing but I feel like I've you
know<00:01:38.610> had<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.270> tweaks<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
know had so little tweaks that kind of

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.230 
know had so little tweaks that kind of
made<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> big<00:01:40.380> improvement<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.880> I'd

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
made a big improvement for me and I'd

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
made a big improvement for me and I'd
like<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.540> share<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.340> first

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
like to share them with you so the first

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
like to share them with you so the first
thing<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.119> we're<00:01:45.360> talking<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:45.810> breathing

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
thing as we're talking about breathing

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
thing as we're talking about breathing
is<00:01:46.799> putting<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:47.939> attention

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
is putting a little bit more attention

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.710 
is putting a little bit more attention
on<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.009> breathe<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> take

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
on where do we breathe so when you take

know<00:03:34.799> what<00:03:35.040> shifts<00:03:35.549> might<00:03:36.150> feel<00:03:36.359> differently

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
know what shifts might feel differently

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.860 
know what shifts might feel differently
as<00:03:37.079> you're<00:03:37.260> sitting<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> saddle<00:03:40.430> as<00:03:41.870> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
as you're sitting in the saddle as you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
as you're sitting in the saddle as you
start<00:03:43.169> walking<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.489> about<00:03:44.760> keeping

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
start walking just think about keeping

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.569 
start walking just think about keeping
that<00:03:45.419> same<00:03:45.810> pattern<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.620> breathing<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.190> same

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
that same pattern of breathing that same

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.030 
that same pattern of breathing that same
breathing<00:03:47.970> into<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:48.989> lower<00:03:49.290> back<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:52.319> see

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
breathing into your lower back and see

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.770 
breathing into your lower back and see
if<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.400> even<00:03:53.519> develop<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.150> rhythm<00:03:54.419> with

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
if you can even develop a rhythm with

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.539 
if you can even develop a rhythm with
your<00:03:54.959> breathing<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.650> maybe<00:03:56.129> kind<00:03:56.400> of

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
your breathing that maybe kind of

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.659 
your breathing that maybe kind of
matches<00:03:56.970> your<00:03:57.000> horses<00:03:57.540> steps<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.049> bit

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
matches your horses steps a little bit

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.159 
matches your horses steps a little bit
and<00:03:59.669> this<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.389> be<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.750> good<00:04:00.989> way<00:04:01.139> to

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
and this can be a really good way to

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.259 
and this can be a really good way to
start<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.859> feel<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.639> you've<00:04:02.790> got<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> little

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
start to feel like you've got a little

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.430 
start to feel like you've got a little
bit<00:04:03.510> more<00:04:03.540> rhythm<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.409> your<00:04:04.739> riding<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.440> then

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
bit more rhythm in your riding and then

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.470 
bit more rhythm in your riding and then
you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.769> take<00:04:08.010> this<00:04:08.220> into<00:04:08.519> even<00:04:08.879> more<00:04:08.909> than

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
you can take this into even more than

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.979 
you can take this into even more than
just<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> walk<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.470> see<00:04:11.159> how<00:04:11.519> many<00:04:11.579> different

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
just the walk and see how many different

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.390 
just the walk and see how many different
situations<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.229> your<00:04:13.470> horse<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.979> with<00:04:14.190> your

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
situations with your horse and with your

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.060 
situations with your horse and with your
riding<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:15.299> can<00:04:15.329> breathe<00:04:15.870> through<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.859> what<00:04:17.039> I

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
riding you can breathe through so what I

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.610 
riding you can breathe through so what I
mean<00:04:17.340> by<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:18.000> if<00:04:18.239> your<00:04:18.419> horse<00:04:18.630> starts<00:04:19.470> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
mean by this is if your horse starts to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.740 
mean by this is if your horse starts to
spook<00:04:19.889> at<00:04:20.070> something<00:04:20.519> or<00:04:20.760> maybe<00:04:21.389> your<00:04:21.570> horse

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
spook at something or maybe your horse

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.330 
spook at something or maybe your horse
gets<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.109> little<00:04:22.349> bit<00:04:22.500> up<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.949> gets<00:04:23.159> a<00:04:23.250> little

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
gets a little bit up and gets a little

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580 
gets a little bit up and gets a little
bit<00:04:23.550> excited<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.930> keep<00:04:25.169> breathing

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
bit excited can you keep breathing

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.110 
bit excited can you keep breathing
through<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.700> situation

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
through that situation

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.030 
through that situation
and<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.600> what<00:04:28.960> kind<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.380> difference<00:04:29.770> that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
and see what kind of a difference that

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.010 
and see what kind of a difference that
makes<00:04:30.580> for<00:04:30.850> your<00:04:30.940> horse<00:04:31.180> or<00:04:31.389> even<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:31.870> it's
