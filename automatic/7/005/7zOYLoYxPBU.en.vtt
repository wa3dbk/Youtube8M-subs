tutorial hello again everyone we're now
back<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> our<00:00:58.050> build<00:00:58.350> world<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
back in our build world so I have this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
back in our build world so I have this
base<00:01:00.600> 7<00:01:01.140> by<00:01:01.320> 11<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> do

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
base 7 by 11 and what we're going to do

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.320 
base 7 by 11 and what we're going to do
is<00:01:03.989> start<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.339> placing<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> block<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is start and placing a block on this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.200 
is start and placing a block on this
corner<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> gap<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.950> free<00:01:08.330> block<00:01:09.330> there

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
corner from a gap of free block there

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
corner from a gap of free block there
the<00:01:12.210> other<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.780> same<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> block<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the other side do the same so a block on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
the other side do the same so a block on
the<00:01:13.710> corner<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.299> free<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the corner if you get for free and a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.190 
the corner if you get for free and a
block<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.530> say<00:01:17.280> no<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.600> doesn't<00:01:18.900> really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
block there say no that doesn't really

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
block there say no that doesn't really
matter<00:01:19.439> cuz<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
matter cuz what we're going to do is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.859 
matter cuz what we're going to do is
just<00:01:21.570> build<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.400> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.700> walls<00:01:23.909> apart<00:01:24.540> from

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
just build up all the walls apart from

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
just build up all the walls apart from
the<00:01:25.020> ones<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.439> between<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.890> block<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.880> tend

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the ones in between that block so I tend

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
the ones in between that block so I tend
to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> free<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.250> hold<00:01:29.520> down

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to do it free up then just hold down

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
to do it free up then just hold down
shift<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:30.479> fall<00:01:30.720> off

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
shift so I don't fall off

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.420 
shift so I don't fall off
just<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.189> walking<00:01:32.640> around

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.610

I<00:03:34.989> always<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.349> what's<00:03:36.890> an<00:03:37.010> easy<00:03:37.190> thing<00:03:37.580> to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
I always do that what's an easy thing to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.699 
I always do that what's an easy thing to
do<00:03:37.819> actually<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.510> come<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.080> end<00:03:39.230> here<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
do actually is come to the end here and

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.020 
do actually is come to the end here and
just<00:03:40.010> face<00:03:40.250> forwards

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
just face forwards

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.270 
just face forwards
just<00:03:41.840> hold<00:03:42.080> your<00:03:42.200> button<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:42.920> as<00:03:43.069> this

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
just hold your button so as this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.490 
just hold your button so as this
conveyor<00:03:43.670> belt<00:03:43.879> drags<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.269> back<00:03:44.470> place<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
conveyor belt drags you back place the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.150 
conveyor belt drags you back place the
blocks<00:03:45.950> now<00:03:46.930> they<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.140> come<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:49.040> only

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
blocks now they just come so it's only

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.180 
blocks now they just come so it's only
to<00:03:49.550> high<00:03:49.819> in<00:03:49.970> these<00:03:50.120> parts<00:03:50.540> not<00:03:50.810> three<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.860> jump

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
to high in these parts not three so jump

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.120 
to high in these parts not three so jump
up<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.360> make<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.080> neater<00:03:54.319> so<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:54.920> cover

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
up and just make it neater so just cover

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:03.940 
up and just make it neater so just cover
this<00:03:55.310> up<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:02.780> while<00:04:03.049> you're<00:04:03.230> doing<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.590> you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
this up now while you're doing that you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.240 
this up now while you're doing that you
could<00:04:04.129> jump<00:04:04.340> up<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.170> can<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:09.170> fill<00:04:09.920> in<00:04:10.069> this

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
could jump up if I can just fill in this

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.190 
could jump up if I can just fill in this
roof<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:14.000> can<00:04:14.299> do<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.599> later<00:04:14.810> if<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.079> want

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
roof you can do it later if you want

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.409 
roof you can do it later if you want
it's<00:04:15.560> probably<00:04:16.160> easier<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.609> do<00:04:16.820> at<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.120> stage

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
it's probably easier to do at this stage

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.819 
it's probably easier to do at this stage
and<00:04:18.790> again<00:04:19.790> jump<00:04:20.359> back<00:04:20.540> down<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.530> main

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
and again jump back down this is a main

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.560 
and again jump back down this is a main
build<00:04:22.160> just<00:04:23.090> cover<00:04:23.600> these<00:04:23.840> two<00:04:24.139> up<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.570> these

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
build just cover these two up and these

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.080 
build just cover these two up and these
free<00:04:26.930> here<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:28.070> now<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.280> can't<00:04:28.639> come<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.030> this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
free here so now you can't come to this

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.840 
free here so now you can't come to this
block<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.630> free<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.260> get<00:04:30.650> stained<00:04:31.520> glass

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
block of free and get stained glass

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.360 
block of free and get stained glass
plank<00:04:32.270> panes<00:04:32.690> also<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:33.500> been<00:04:33.650> Tekkit<00:04:34.100> but

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
plank panes also just been Tekkit but

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.480 
plank panes also just been Tekkit but
you<00:04:34.669> could<00:04:34.970> probably<00:04:35.270> use<00:04:35.570> glass<00:04:35.900> planes

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
you could probably use glass planes

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.950 
you could probably use glass planes
normal<00:04:37.490> ones<00:04:37.639> where<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.270> go<00:04:38.389> do<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.750> could

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
normal ones where you go do you could

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.310 
normal ones where you go do you could
place<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.860> up<00:04:39.979> this<00:04:40.220> wall<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.669> three<00:04:41.050> place<00:04:42.050> one

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
place it up this wall of three place one

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.710 
place it up this wall of three place one
on<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.620> ceiling<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.220> down<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.360> wall<00:04:44.510> of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
on the ceiling and down the wall of

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.300 
on the ceiling and down the wall of
three<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> other<00:04:45.350> side<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.950> will<00:04:46.190> act

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
three on the other side so this will act

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.600 
three on the other side so this will act

as your sort of metal detector back to
your<00:04:49.700> block<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.150> quartz<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.690> place<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.200> on<00:04:51.350> the

I've<00:05:00.650> chosen<00:05:01.520> quartz<00:05:02.060> because<00:05:02.270> that's<00:05:02.479> my

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
I've chosen quartz because that's my

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.570 
I've chosen quartz because that's my
block<00:05:02.870> just<00:05:03.410> place<00:05:03.680> them<00:05:03.860> on<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.010> back<00:05:04.310> so

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
block just place them on the back so

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.940 
block just place them on the back so
