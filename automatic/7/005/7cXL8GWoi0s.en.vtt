00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.220
 if we are in what was like that in a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.220
 tutorial of the flop and 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.849
 in which you are all injured and send a 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.940
 new video today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.730
 solve the flop and eat 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.040
 in this video as I know many people 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 he is not interested in the theory simply 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'm going to teach how to solve this cube with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 an algorithm a very simple algorithm of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.790
 simply very simple of simply a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.739
 quite simple algorithm that only 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.809
 has two movements these two 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.390
 movements are repeated over and over again 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.000
 until we get what we want not and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 basically what it does is to orient two 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.790
 edges then let's start I'm not going 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.830
 talk too much about what I know I'm not going 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.230
 to explain too much about er in this 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.839
 video I'll do another one later on which 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.659
 I will leave the description explaining everything 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.610
 about the flop and and the toys and it's 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.280
 since it 's undone, let's go 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.979
 finish observing it because what 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.500
 interesting about this cube is that one without 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.510
 want to love it put it together solve it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.850
 do it or simply be like this by turning it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.800
 can randomly solve it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 It has happened more than once 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.080
 and well let's start the only thing that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.230
 we have to do is solve the line 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.200
 skinny the life you read is 3 x 3 forgiveness 3 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.180
 x 1 these lines we have to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.580
 solve with a couple of moves and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 will it or will not it be with 3 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.350
 let's see white what we have to know 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.480
 is that the turns are in this way the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 yellow can only be exchanged with 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.490
 white and green can only be 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 exchange with the blue therefore I 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.290
 I will never have a yellow in this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.080
 line nor will I have a blue 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.540
 in this line ok is impossible then 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.880
 let's start to see if there is yellow here 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.000
 here in white since yellow in the other 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.070
 side the yellow will be in the center 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 effectively so we bring not about 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 the yellow pieces here very well and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.950
 now we go with the good green 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.759
 you just have to turn 180 degrees 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.009
 and this one 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.450
 it's not a step for anything difficult is a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.110
 pretty pretty simple step 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.480
 now we go with the permutation is the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.400
 perfect example the only thing that we have 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.920
 what to do is to orient these two edges 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.170
 and how we will do it well we can 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.610
 grab the bucket like that so like this or like 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.739
 we really want there is no 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.530
 problem we will simply have to go to 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.980
 the faces that we want to orient one and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.959
 again 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.269
 in this way yes they have lengthened and 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.269
 here is the orange I do 1 1 2 2 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.950
 and this would be r and r 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.950
 r 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.050
 rr 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.050
 r 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.630
 and what happens if we have it so nothing 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.360
 we simply do the d 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.800
 d 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.080
 the d 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.810
 and if and how not already could give 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.730
 account or is it quite obvious 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.760
 we simply rotate it this way and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.090
 we make r 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.090
 r 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.620
 and this one turned out the truth is a game 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.780
 pretty simple but not only does it have a 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.330
 situation of two contiguous edges 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.480
 also has them also has some 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.670
 possibilities that are the four edges 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.780
 or the other is two separate edges 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.240
 let's see 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 and here is 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.440
 or is out of focus 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.920
 and here is the other situation would be the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.110
 two opposing edges 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.989
 to solve this we simply turn 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.080
 two contiguous edges and what 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.880
 we will automatically have two more 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.610
 contiguous I explain these are 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.810
 contrary I turn these two and then 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.810
 I turn these two samples of l 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.270
 of him 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 and we have two now we do for example 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.410
 here as well as sidewalks and waters and 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.760
 well there is no change we are by 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.940
 example r 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.150
 r r 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 and it's done but we have a situation 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.060
 more and it would be this four more edges 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.070
 oriented in this case simply 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.320
 we orient 2 and then we will orient the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.690
 another two or for example these two and 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.600
 then these two although it can also be 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.590
 these 2 and these two or as we want or 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.590
 be no problem let's see 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.590
 r 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:00.840
 of r is now made of these 2 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.840
 l 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.740
 and it's done, I've just taught you 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.620
 all the situations that this has 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.090
 cube or simply let's review a 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.020
 Super fast review 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.919
 let's fix the thinnest part of the cube 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.639
 yellow yellow 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.919
 that is green green exact now be 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.820
 all done now let's do this I 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.820
 2 left 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.160
 rr 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.160
 perfect 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.510
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.980
 here ends the tutorial I hope you 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.960
 have served, leave a like comment 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.680
 put favorites or share it with your 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.690
 friends 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.090
 I do not know if I already said it but good the case 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.190
 is that next week I will make a video 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.520
 explanatory explaining to whoever wants 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.560
 understand the theory of this cube can go 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.050
 of juices in general because I'll leave it 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.970
 in the description since I know there's 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.610
 people that what they like is to see how they 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.830
 solve or quickly learn how to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.510
 resolves without understanding it there is another one that if 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.490
 he likes to understand it and good for that in 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.740
 this video later to explain them 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.560
 how this cube works and the cubes and it's 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.060
 in general so see you in the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.060
 next goodbye
