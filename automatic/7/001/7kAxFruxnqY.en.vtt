00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello everyone welcome back to me 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.379
 channel I'm here again for 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.570
 make a very fast video of the 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.280
 outfit and the little things I have to go 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.500
 to the gym in the bag to go to 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.350
 gym well first I teach you what 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.200
 I have in the bag and now I show you the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.230
 things the clothes are worth first and foremost 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.039
 important a bottle of water is worth 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.420
 I'm wearing this big because to me 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.960
 then a lot of water when I'm in the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.960
 fitness center 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.260
 then another very important thing is 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 a towel 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 fundamentally the water and the towel that we 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.769
 never miss my mother what face of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.949
 do it I have I just picked that up 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.970
 be please you have case it is expensive 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.840
 nearly 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.030
 it's worth the next thing I'm carrying are these 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 bags these bags these 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.280
 gums 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.420
 for when I finish training I do 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.129
 Stretches then are different 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.460
 this is the rose that has less 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.780
 resistance and then there are others for 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.720
 example is blue that is more 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 I know it's harder, it's worth it 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.360
 do stretches, well, I do 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 I can record a video of how the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 I use it to teach you to 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.540
 and then another thing that I have is this 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.980
 hair clip because I have very hair 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.720
 long and then what I do is that 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.630
 I do it in a bun and I hold it with 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.229
 the clamp 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.810
 my ipod so I put it on my arm 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.250
 to run good not to run not because no 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.840
 I can run for an injury that I have in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.640
 the back of a crushed vertebra 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.950
 then it is not convenient that it runs because 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.300
 I can hurt myself then in the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.979
 elliptical or cardio wave for me 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.210
 I put on my arm so it does not bother me 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.990
 Then he brought some Kleenex 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 a candy for a drop of sugar or 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.190
 some girl is dizzy some boy is 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.709
 so good tide is always good to bring 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.800
 a packet of sugar a candy for 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.450
 that the for sugar and petroleum jelly for 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.260
 the lips because it dries me a lot 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.500
 ok and that's it, that's what I have in 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.110
 bag and now the outfit that I wear 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.209

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.030

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.020

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.180
 adjusted at the time of running to do 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.910

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.660
 move and I like them then you took 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.629
 I bought them in sales and I love them and 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.459
 a basic tank top that is 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.790
 I bought it in primark ok I do not know if 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.469

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.469

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:13.129

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.209
 money to go moon to the gym good 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.730
 exercise but good 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.470
 good if we can go a little bit like 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
 even if we wear this bristle face I do not 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.230
 I am in favor of going makeup 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.599
 gym because you sweat and I prefer to go 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.689
 with the clean face that if I go up and I 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.629
 basic the towel does not stay brown 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.720
 and also the good skin because it perspires and 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.120
 do not get dirty so no hobbies 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.819
