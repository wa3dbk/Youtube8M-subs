speaker when I finished it so here it is
it<00:00:05.759> needs<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.060> cover<00:00:06.299> still<00:00:06.660> everything<00:00:06.899> but

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
it needs to cover still everything but

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.520 
it needs to cover still everything but
essentially<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.950> works<00:00:08.750> now<00:00:09.750> when<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.290> still

a bicycle brake caliper looking at the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.560 
a bicycle brake caliper looking at the
bell<00:01:29.890> crank<00:01:30.250> here<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.460> actual<00:01:33.759> frame<00:01:34.210> it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
bell crank here as the actual frame it

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.460 
bell crank here as the actual frame it
was<00:01:34.810> an<00:01:34.990> old<00:01:35.140> school<00:01:35.500> chair<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.659> there's<00:01:38.020> an

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
was an old school chair and there's an

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.590 
was an old school chair and there's an
amplifier<00:01:39.100> here<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:40.090> use<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.479> its

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
amplifier here so I can use it on its

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
amplifier here so I can use it on its
own<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:42.070> power<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.360> switch<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.899> there

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
own and then power and switch is there

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.870 
own and then power and switch is there
the<00:01:45.130> actual<00:01:46.020> contact<00:01:47.020> for<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> speaker<00:01:47.880> runs

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
the actual contact for the speaker runs

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
the actual contact for the speaker runs
in<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.270> out<00:01:49.360> each<00:01:50.110> side<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.030> there<00:01:52.270> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in and out each side there and there so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.120 
in and out each side there and there so
there<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.100> have<00:01:54.159> it

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.110
