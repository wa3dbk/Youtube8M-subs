00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.940 
it's very portable so I mean and as you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
can see here it's got a rechargeable
battery<00:01:44.060> from<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> looks<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
battery from the looks of it it's got a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.950 
battery from the looks of it it's got a
USB<00:01:46.290> charger<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.630> micro<00:01:48.930> USB

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.109 
USB charger right there and a micro USB
charger<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.460> guess<00:01:50.700> charge<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
charger so you can I guess charge it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.749 
charger so you can I guess charge it
multiple<00:01:51.479> ways<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> wanted<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
multiple ways here and if you wanted to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.370 
multiple ways here and if you wanted to
I'm<00:01:53.880> guessing<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I'm guessing you can use this as a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
I'm guessing you can use this as a
little<00:01:55.890> Sun<00:01:56.159> bar<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.640> TV<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.750> your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
computer actually oh because it's got a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
computer actually oh because it's got a
line<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.960> connect<00:02:01.290> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
