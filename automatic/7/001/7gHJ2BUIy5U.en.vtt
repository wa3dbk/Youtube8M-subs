00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.670
 so you have to ask yourself to explain 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.869
 to let 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.070
 this thing with the brake market 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.689
 at all works because I have yes 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.770
 no idea what it is 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.379
 he is pulled from his finger 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.420
 and then he is getting heavier and heavier 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.840
 and we have that in four 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.500
 have speed classes 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.600
 We go for the bank on four courses and then 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 just runs debug faster and faster 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.900
 above and the brake car will be in shorter 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.059
 time we have our heavier and heavier 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.949
 old men all day nothing 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.199
 do the evening to annoy the people 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.269
 if you stop the trek before you 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.540
 Upstairs, doing work is really good 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.489
 because it's her how you say her beautiful 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.519
 appeal to freshen up the old days 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.519
 hold 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.760
 So we can we have two 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.760
 all these brake cars can 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.730
 we get best seven tons 75 tons 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.040
 brakes and brakes with the other 18 18 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.290
 tons of heavy carrier because he has 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.770
 about a brake power of 40 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:38.090
 metric tons 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:41.120
 So these 18 tractors 107 106 den 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.310
 We have series that can today to 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.770
 Make 18 tons heavy 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 and they just become big 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.530
 braked the small looks small indeed 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.510
 but holds on pretty well so the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.800
 small carrier is where to start 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.770
 the prehistory from 0 to 15 ps 15 ps 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.030
 until anyway 18 13 like the classes 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.010
 are divided and even if the small one 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.540
 prince 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.540
 the power is and is the focus of the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.300
 c-class can the small brake car because 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.280
 one can not tell him 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.780
 yes, just as involved in the list and the problem 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.560
 can also do a bit 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 make it more beautiful but it always goes ahead 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.550
 So you still had reserve or food 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.550
 Aces in the sleeve 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 Pronounce the people a bit 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.060
 yes, if we want, and we have 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.520
 great classes both 30 and 40 trekkers 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.250
 there are because we've been doing this a 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.130
 hertha so not so much 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.910
 make stuck in the group 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.599
 we just do it at 50 or 60 meters 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.840
 we are celebrating 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.390
 So you can set in fire though 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.780
 were on a particular every room 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.599
 a steel plate then chisels into the earth 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.160
 rammed so that the braking power amplified 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.920
 is weighted by where the bank 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.819
 right there and there you can in case 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.410
 because now the event is complete 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.440
 many trekkers can not do all four 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.170
 hits trek driver to follow any 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.290
 would indeed like to fully cool but at 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.959
 that's what we do before we do that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.780
 just try that on his 80th 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.180
 meter times thus but if he already 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.220
 four five times been of the braking car 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.959
 then we make the little turn normal 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.819
 a strong brake car three and a half 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.579
 basic performance and the ground you to today 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.220
 hard braking the cars will be easier 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.160
 a deputy advances just like that 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.829
 to do with it and that's just ours 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.660
 feeling with the many group on the way 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.850
 then we already know how 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.829
 ground and make as they live 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.260
 should have because also the carrier 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.750
 a little fun factory driver 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.739
 if the trainer persevere then and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.659
 everything works 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 We are happy , too 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.409
 tracker the roma captain up to 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.420
 next events 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.420
 to be repaired sometimes at night 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.300
 the driver stops driving 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.420
 because just accident times 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.650
 photo bernd have to keep the low 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.680
 driver himself 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.570
 have been going on when the appendix 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.730
 they were on and go and if 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:53.530
 at all he drives with a small one 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.140
 thanks ahead and tried the victim 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.270
 Pull necklace forward to close 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.960
 test how the floor is tomorrow with it 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.450
 we just hold each first place 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.920
 we hope to achieve because the 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.840
 The problems are with this engine 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.699
 device that can turn them as big 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.470
 the achsprobleme the force becomes on the 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.990
 he has to pick up the axle 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.090
 and how are we going today? 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.639
 service car driver has everything 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.770
 set complex started and wants 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.060
 while above the fire department in reception 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.710
 take and we will marry 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 ask as Werner Lehmann you've got 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.150
 finished so far he has now the 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.880
 of state are greater wheelchair from 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:45.050
 The prince is ready as far as we will 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:47.200
 Let's see how it works and now 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.200
 going 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.669
 So now we have set that 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.350
 also goodwill gets and we can the 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.419
 set first fish sharpness 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.550
 but we did not want that we wanted 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.900
 First, see that even a people without 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.900
 crises so-called test
