00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
but most of the time it works was not

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.710 
but most of the time it works was not
but<00:03:09.590> not<00:03:09.709> as<00:03:09.860> well<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:10.129> on<00:03:10.250> normal<00:03:10.579> place<00:03:10.760> but

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
but not as well as on normal place but

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.860 
but not as well as on normal place but
if<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.319> put<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.849> still<00:03:14.659> as

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
if you put it on like this it still as

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.759 
if you put it on like this it still as
you<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.019> see<00:03:15.140> there's<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.349> little<00:03:15.409> bit<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.650> an

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
you can see there's a little bit of an

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.580 
you can see there's a little bit of an
indentation<00:03:16.450> like<00:03:17.450> upwards<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.440> can

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
indentation like upwards so you can

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.080 
indentation like upwards so you can
choose<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.860> nail<00:03:19.129> even<00:03:19.459> if<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.610> don't<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.819> any

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
choose a nail even if you don't have any

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.630 
choose a nail even if you don't have any
like<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.780> clip<00:03:21.079> mine<00:03:21.319> like<00:03:21.530> about<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.860> yesterday

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
like I clip mine like about it yesterday

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.830 
like I clip mine like about it yesterday
night<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.750> yeah<00:03:25.269> they<00:03:26.269> can<00:03:26.420> still<00:03:26.569> come<00:03:26.750> off

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
night and yeah they can still come off

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.240 
night and yeah they can still come off
pretty<00:03:26.989> easily<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.829> place<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.750> yeah<00:03:30.250> so

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
pretty easily this place but yeah so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.920 
pretty easily this place but yeah so
that's<00:03:31.549> basically<00:03:31.730> all<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.510> can<00:03:32.629> do<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
that's basically all you can do with the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.110 
that's basically all you can do with the
first<00:03:33.109> separator<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:34.400> pick<00:03:34.640> up<00:03:34.760> two<00:03:34.909> of<00:03:35.000> them

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
first separator this pick up two of them

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.059 
first separator this pick up two of them
you<00:03:35.750> have<00:03:35.959> two<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> same<00:03:36.319> plates<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.920> two

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
you have two of the same plates like two

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.670 
you have two of the same plates like two
of<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.220> same<00:03:37.400> place<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.359> can<00:03:38.989> get

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
of the same place like this you can get

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.930 
of the same place like this you can get
one<00:03:39.799> on<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.950> bottom<00:03:40.099> one<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.579> top<00:03:40.760> and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
one on the bottom one on the top and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.589 
one on the bottom one on the top and
then<00:03:41.200> make<00:03:42.200> them<00:03:42.319> look<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.269> it'll<00:03:44.269> take

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
then make them look like and it'll take

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.050 
then make them look like and it'll take
to<00:03:44.780> place<00:03:45.019> there<00:03:45.230> at<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.440> same<00:03:46.150> width<00:03:47.150> off

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
to place there at the same width off

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.340 
to place there at the same width off
yeah<00:03:51.069> so<00:03:52.240> it's<00:03:53.240> like<00:03:53.360> if<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.959> second<00:03:54.260> one
