I'm going to teach you how to reform
Mills<00:00:03.060> mess<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.470> very<00:00:04.710> advanced<00:00:05.220> juggling

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
Mills mess it's a very advanced juggling

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.570 
Mills mess it's a very advanced juggling
trick<00:00:06.799> definitely<00:00:07.799> one<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> best<00:00:08.130> visual

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
trick definitely one of the best visual

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.970 
trick definitely one of the best visual
tricks<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.059> we're<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> most<00:00:10.290> fun<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.620> perform

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
tricks and we're the most fun to perform

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.910 
tricks and we're the most fun to perform
so<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.759> around<00:00:12.120> good<00:00:12.389> trick<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.900> think<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.830> took

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
so all around good trick I think it took

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.530 
so all around good trick I think it took
me<00:00:14.070> about<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> week<00:00:14.400> or<00:00:14.849> two<00:00:15.030> weeks<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.420> learn

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
me about a week or two weeks to learn

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.050 
me about a week or two weeks to learn
because<00:00:16.199> i<00:00:16.500> use<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> ball<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.490> ball<00:00:17.699> method

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
because i use the ball by ball method

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
because i use the ball by ball method
but<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.420> learned<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.250> like

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
but I learned and I really don't like

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.939 
but I learned and I really don't like
living<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.840> builds<00:00:22.080> mess<00:00:22.320> every

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
living with that it builds mess every

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.870 
living with that it builds mess every
ball<00:00:23.100> has<00:00:23.310> its<00:00:23.519> own<00:00:23.670> cat<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.010> don't<00:00:26.010> mumble

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
ball has its own cat so I don't mumble

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.439 
ball has its own cat so I don't mumble
all<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> time<00:00:27.210> other<00:00:28.080> room<00:00:28.260> overs<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
all the time other room overs like this

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
all the time other room overs like this
from<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> fun<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.090> don't

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
from all this fun with this I don't

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.080 
from all this fun with this I don't
remember<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.730> that's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> really

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
remember all that but that's a really

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.380 
remember all that but that's a really
inefficient<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> learning<00:00:37.260> Mills<00:00:38.129> mess

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
inefficient way of learning Mills mess

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
inefficient way of learning Mills mess
so<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.840> today<00:00:40.050> while<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.620> doing<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.950> on

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so just today while it's doing one on

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
so just today while it's doing one on
earlier<00:00:41.309> videos<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.730> accidentally<00:00:42.329> discovered

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
earlier videos I accidentally discovered

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.900 
earlier videos I accidentally discovered
a<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> makes<00:00:43.829> Mills<00:00:44.160> mess<00:00:44.340> like

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
a way that makes Mills mess like

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.139 
a way that makes Mills mess like
unbelievably<00:00:45.809> easy<00:00:46.039> very<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.610> easy<00:00:47.820> trip<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
unbelievably easy very very easy trip to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
unbelievably easy very very easy trip to
perform<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.289> even<00:00:49.590> made<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> easier<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
perform now and even made it easier for

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.450 
perform now and even made it easier for
me<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> differently<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
me that I think of it differently so

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.490 
me that I think of it differently so
here's<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.610> Mills<00:00:53.820> rest<00:00:54.030> looks<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.569 

and<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:58.370> light<00:00:58.700> blog

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.230 

so<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.570> its<00:01:03.719> own<00:01:03.839> path<00:01:04.970> now<00:01:05.970> try<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so this one has its own path now try to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200 
so this one has its own path now try to
permit<00:01:06.540> different<00:01:06.869> place<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:08.210> does

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
permit different place now does

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.430 
permit different place now does
different<00:01:09.570> paths

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.460 

that's<00:01:12.800> another<00:01:13.040> different<00:01:13.400> path<00:01:14.200> each<00:01:15.200> ball

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that's another different path each ball

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.870 
that's another different path each ball
is<00:01:15.710> going<00:01:15.890> on<00:01:16.160> it's<00:01:16.310> only<00:01:16.490> route<00:01:17.710> now<00:01:18.880> instead

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
is going on it's only route now instead

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.850 
is going on it's only route now instead

of thing reveals mess has a greeley
original<00:01:22.580> complicated<00:01:23.210> pattern<00:01:23.620> think<00:01:24.620> of<00:01:24.710> it

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
original complicated pattern think of it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.580 
original complicated pattern think of it
essica<00:01:25.550> Lee<00:01:25.640> alternating<00:01:26.600> under<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.440> arm

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
essica Lee alternating under the arm

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.410 
essica Lee alternating under the arm
this<00:01:28.490> point<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.850> should<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:29.030> able<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.300> do

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
this point you should be able to do

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.740 
this point you should be able to do
things<00:01:30.200> around<00:01:30.470> like<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:31.600> pretty<00:01:32.600> simple

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
things around like that pretty simple

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.770 
things around like that pretty simple
but<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.650> just<00:01:36.830> sort<00:01:36.980> of<00:01:37.720> message<00:01:38.720> it

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
but if you just sort of message it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.030 
but if you just sort of message it
together<00:01:39.050> you<00:01:39.230> should<00:01:39.260> know<00:01:39.500> good<00:01:39.740> about<00:01:39.860> this

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
together you should know good about this

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.920 
together you should know good about this
one<00:01:40.250> also<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.870> under<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.290> arm<00:01:42.470> like<00:01:42.680> this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
one also if you under the arm like this

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.320 
one also if you under the arm like this
after<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> while<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.410> will<00:01:45.830> start<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.250> do<00:01:46.490> bills

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
after a while you will start to do bills

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.990 
after a while you will start to do bills
mess<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.290> normally<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.830> joined<00:01:49.100> beyond<00:01:49.340> like

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
mess and normally we joined beyond like

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.490 
mess and normally we joined beyond like
this<00:01:51.010> that's<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.130> good<00:01:52.250> thing<00:01:52.370> right<00:01:52.730> there

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
this that's a good thing right there

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.130 
this that's a good thing right there
horrible<00:01:54.500> window<00:01:55.210> bring<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> other<00:01:56.600> out

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
horrible window bring to the other out

of<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.350> arm<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.729> automatically<00:01:59.420> start<00:01:59.810> doing

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
of the arm you automatically start doing

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.260 
of the arm you automatically start doing
the<00:02:00.080> Mills<00:02:00.229> mess<00:02:00.440> it's<00:02:00.710> hard<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.070> explain<00:02:01.270> but

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
the Mills mess it's hard to explain but

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.969 
the Mills mess it's hard to explain but
once<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.630> start<00:02:02.690> doing<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.110> you'll<00:02:03.770> just

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
once you start doing this you'll just

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.460 
once you start doing this you'll just
get<00:02:04.190> into<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.430> flow<00:02:04.550> of<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:06.050> you'll<00:02:06.380> be

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
get into the flow of it and you'll be

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.840 
get into the flow of it and you'll be
doing<00:02:06.680> Mills<00:02:06.890> mess<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.310> no<00:02:07.490> time

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.760 

normally<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.780> trip<00:02:10.960> would<00:02:11.050> take<00:02:11.350> me<00:02:11.740> like

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
normally this trip would take me like

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.740 
normally this trip would take me like
several<00:02:12.100> parts<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.640> explain<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.210> now<00:02:13.630> if

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
several parts to explain that now if

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.230 
several parts to explain that now if
this<00:02:13.840> fruit<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.580> lot<00:02:15.580> easier<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:16.090> not

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
this fruit is just a lot easier I'm not

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.060 
this fruit is just a lot easier I'm not
sure<00:02:16.480> how<00:02:16.750> quickly<00:02:17.080> you'll<00:02:17.410> pick<00:02:17.620> up<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.920> this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
sure how quickly you'll pick up on this

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.760 
sure how quickly you'll pick up on this
if<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.270> juggle<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.600> for<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> while<00:02:20.020> should

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
if you can juggle in for a while should

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.250 
if you can juggle in for a while should
be<00:02:20.890> pretty<00:02:21.100> simple<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> let's<00:02:22.870> get<00:02:22.990> into<00:02:23.050> strip

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
be pretty simple so let's get into strip

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.160 
be pretty simple so let's get into strip
it<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.710> your<00:02:23.860> arm<00:02:24.240> alternating<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.390> you're

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
it on your arm alternating and you're

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.950 
it on your arm alternating and you're
doing<00:02:26.560> those<00:02:26.740> mess<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.120> only<00:02:28.420> reason<00:02:28.570> my<00:02:28.750> arms

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
doing those mess the only reason my arms

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.810 
doing those mess the only reason my arms
are<00:02:29.050> crossing<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.920> because<00:02:30.610> I'm<00:02:30.700> throwing

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
are crossing is because I'm throwing

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.590 
are crossing is because I'm throwing
this<00:02:31.030> end<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.360> arm<00:02:33.120> looks<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.300> lot<00:02:34.540> more

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
this end of the arm looks a lot more

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.440 
this end of the arm looks a lot more
complicated<00:02:35.110> than<00:02:35.320> actually<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:37.180> once<00:02:37.360> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
complicated than actually now once you

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.300 
complicated than actually now once you
can<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> real<00:02:37.810> mess<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.800> easily<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
can do a real mess you can easily do the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.310 
can do a real mess you can easily do the
window<00:02:41.070> not<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.870> easily<00:02:44.110> do

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
window not like that you can easily do

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.800 
window not like that you can easily do
the<00:02:44.440> rhythm<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:46.140> switch<00:02:47.140> directions<00:02:48.810> because

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
the rhythm and switch directions because

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.270 
the rhythm and switch directions because
that's<00:02:50.050> all<00:02:50.260> Mills<00:02:50.920> mess<00:02:51.130> is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.250 

so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.250 

there's<00:03:00.830> no<00:03:01.040> snacks
