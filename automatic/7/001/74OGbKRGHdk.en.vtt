00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
and just sitting off to the side there I

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.170 
and just sitting off to the side there I
don't<00:00:27.100> know<00:00:27.160> if<00:00:27.250> I<00:00:27.310> can<00:00:27.460> catch<00:00:27.640> it<00:00:27.820> but<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.090> can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
don't know if I can catch it but you can

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.910 
don't know if I can catch it but you can
see<00:00:28.330> that<00:00:28.480> there's<00:00:28.690> a<00:00:28.900> little<00:00:29.530> bit<00:00:29.800> of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
see that there's a little bit of

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.060 
see that there's a little bit of
moisture<00:00:30.100> gathering<00:00:30.760> on<00:00:30.880> top<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.300> egg<00:00:31.420> so

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
moisture gathering on top of the egg so

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760 
moisture gathering on top of the egg so
and<00:00:33.070> there's<00:00:33.399> they're<00:00:33.910> all<00:00:34.030> plenty<00:00:34.500> firm<00:00:35.500> and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
and there's they're all plenty firm and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.920 
and there's they're all plenty firm and
plump<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.370> feel<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:36.970> little<00:00:37.240> leathery<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.840> the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
plump and feel a little leathery to the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.920 
plump and feel a little leathery to the
touch<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.280> no<00:00:39.550> longer<00:00:39.610> really<00:00:40.420> need<00:00:40.630> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
touch so we no longer really need the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.350 
touch so we no longer really need the
paper<00:00:41.170> towel<00:00:41.470> set<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.860> top<00:00:42.130> but<00:00:42.400> we'll<00:00:43.030> keep<00:00:43.180> an

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
paper towel set on top but we'll keep an

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
paper towel set on top but we'll keep an
eye<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:43.510> especially<00:00:44.170> this<00:00:44.530> top<00:00:44.770> one<00:00:45.010> here<00:00:45.310> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
eye on especially this top one here is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.410 
eye on especially this top one here is
he's<00:00:46.570> most<00:00:46.870> exposed<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.680> air<00:00:47.829> so<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.430> egg

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
he's most exposed to the air so that egg

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840 
he's most exposed to the air so that egg
would<00:00:49.600> be<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.960> one<00:00:50.350> most<00:00:50.500> likely<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:51.040> want<00:00:51.760> to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
would be the one most likely to want to

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.819 
would be the one most likely to want to
dry<00:00:52.030> out<00:00:52.060> and<00:00:52.480> what<00:00:52.660> I'll<00:00:52.780> do<00:00:52.989> without<00:00:53.200> this<00:00:53.530> I

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
dry out and what I'll do without this I

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.250 
dry out and what I'll do without this I
could<00:00:54.730> set<00:00:54.970> this<00:00:55.180> stuff<00:00:55.450> on<00:00:55.660> there<00:00:55.899> just<00:00:56.020> like

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
could set this stuff on there just like

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.770 
could set this stuff on there just like
that<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.770> help<00:00:56.920> protect<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.370> egg<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.540> we'll

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
that to help protect that egg but we'll

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.750 
that to help protect that egg but we'll
just<00:00:58.930> keep<00:00:59.050> it<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.350> for<00:00:59.680> now<00:00:59.829> we'll<00:01:00.040> just<00:01:00.070> set

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
just keep it on for now we'll just set

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.020 
just keep it on for now we'll just set
this<00:01:00.910> aside<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.360> let<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:03.219> water<00:01:03.399> inside<00:01:03.820> that

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
this aside and let the water inside that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.440 
this aside and let the water inside that
paper<00:01:04.299> towel<00:01:04.540> evaporate<00:01:05.199> out<00:01:05.409> I<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.299> show

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
her cage I had found a bad egg that was

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.330 
her cage I had found a bad egg that was
pushed<00:01:15.280> aside<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.560> wood<00:01:17.710> shavings<00:01:17.950> of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
pushed aside in in the wood shavings of

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.359 
pushed aside in in the wood shavings of
her<00:01:18.430> tank<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:19.810> see<00:01:20.140> where<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.159> has

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
her tank and you can see where this has

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.980 
her tank and you can see where this has
been<00:01:21.400> in<00:01:21.729> there<00:01:21.909> for<00:01:22.119> almost<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.510> week<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:22.869> it's

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
been in there for almost a week so it's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.539 
been in there for almost a week so it's
a<00:01:23.110> little<00:01:23.290> bit<00:01:23.530> worse<00:01:23.680> off<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.190> what<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.400> was

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
a little bit worse off of what it was

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.359 
a little bit worse off of what it was
what<00:01:24.760> it<00:01:24.880> was<00:01:24.909> first<00:01:25.240> laid<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.190> can

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
what it was first laid but you can

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.929 
what it was first laid but you can
clearly<00:01:27.700> see<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:29.830> side<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.369> know<00:01:30.490> color

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
clearly see this side you know color

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.910 
clearly see this side you know color
size<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.140> slug<00:01:35.500> this<00:01:35.740> is

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
size so this is this is a slug this is

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080 
size so this is this is a slug this is
what<00:01:36.100> slug<00:01:36.400> looks<00:01:36.640> like<00:01:37.049> completely<00:01:38.049> bad

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
what slug looks like completely bad

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.520 
what slug looks like completely bad

there there's there's an air bubble that
develops<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.550> top<00:02:16.730> side<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> egg<00:02:17.330> and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
develops on the top side of the egg and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.320 
develops on the top side of the egg and
that's<00:02:18.110> always<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> remain<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.730> top<00:02:22.330> also

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that's always got to remain on top also

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.980 
that's always got to remain on top also
I<00:02:23.740> mentioned<00:02:24.740> in<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.190> last<00:02:25.220> video<00:02:25.640> about<00:02:26.090> how

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
I mentioned in the last video about how

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.440 
I mentioned in the last video about how
these<00:02:27.170> eggs<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.800> headed<00:02:28.610> here<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.910> each<00:02:29.180> other

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
these eggs are headed here to each other

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.070 
these eggs are headed here to each other
and<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:30.140> some<00:02:30.380> people<00:02:30.680> cut<00:02:31.460> them<00:02:31.610> apart<00:02:32.080> it's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
and as some people cut them apart it's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.020 
and as some people cut them apart it's
kinda<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.710> kind<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.100> misspoke<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:34.880> they

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
kinda I kind of misspoke what they

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.230 
kinda I kind of misspoke what they
really<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.700> gotta<00:02:37.910> catch<00:02:38.120> them

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
really do is is you gotta catch them

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240 
really do is is you gotta catch them
almost<00:02:38.450> suzer<00:02:39.020> ladies<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.770> probably<00:02:40.100> been

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
almost suzer ladies have probably been

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.820 
almost suzer ladies have probably been
far<00:02:40.760> too<00:02:40.790> long<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.260> what<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.380> do<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.710> got

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
far too long but what you do is you got

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.890 
far too long but what you do is you got
to<00:02:42.860> keep<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.280> egg<00:02:43.430> wet<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.850> slowly<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
to keep the egg wet and and slowly and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.090 
to keep the egg wet and and slowly and
very<00:02:47.960> carefully<00:02:48.459> pull<00:02:49.459> them<00:02:49.670> apart<00:02:49.820> where

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
very carefully pull them apart where

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.340 
very carefully pull them apart where
where<00:02:52.100> they're<00:02:52.280> touching<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.230> very

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
where they're touching it but it's very

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.350 
where they're touching it but it's very
tricky<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.010> damage<00:02:55.520> one<00:02:55.730> or<00:02:55.760> both<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
tricky you can damage one or both the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.479 
tricky you can damage one or both the
egg<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.140> just<00:02:57.680> always<00:02:57.830> leave<00:02:58.130> mine<00:02:58.430> and

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
egg so I just always leave mine and

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.380 
egg so I just always leave mine and
cluster<00:03:01.489> together<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:05.120> quick

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
cluster together like this so this quick

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.530 
cluster together like this so this quick
update<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.230> far<00:03:06.470> all<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.920> good<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.489> don't<00:03:08.270> see

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
update so far all it's good I don't see

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.010 
update so far all it's good I don't see
any<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:09.110> bad<00:03:10.360> one<00:03:11.360> things<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.720> would<00:03:11.870> look

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
any going bad one things I would look

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.850 
any going bad one things I would look
for<00:03:12.290> from<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.070> stage<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.780> obviously<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:15.650> is

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
for from this stage on obviously that is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.460 
for from this stage on obviously that is
an<00:03:16.040> easy<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.430> right<00:03:16.700> away<00:03:17.050> now<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.110> next

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
an easy one right away now the next

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.390 
an easy one right away now the next
thing<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:19.100> won't<00:03:19.250> watch<00:03:19.489> for<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.510> mold<00:03:21.400> mold

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
thing we won't watch for is mold mold

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000 
thing we won't watch for is mold mold
will<00:03:22.700> only<00:03:22.850> grow<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.380> bad<00:03:24.590> eggs<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:27.010> for

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
will only grow on the bad eggs and for

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.650 
will only grow on the bad eggs and for
in<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.280> case<00:03:28.489> if<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.300> one<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.540> these

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
in this case if it was one of these

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.020 
in this case if it was one of these
middle<00:03:30.019> ones<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.380> grow<00:03:30.530> mold<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.790> would<00:03:31.880> get

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
middle ones that grow mold you would get

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.940 
middle ones that grow mold you would get
a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.239> bit<00:03:32.420> just<00:03:32.810> where<00:03:33.080> it's<00:03:33.320> connecting

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
a little bit just where it's connecting

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.259 
a little bit just where it's connecting
to<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.160> next<00:03:34.459> egg<00:03:34.640> but<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:34.940> doesn't

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
to the next egg but that doesn't

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.800 
to the next egg but that doesn't
necessarily<00:03:35.360> mean<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.810> eggs<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.370> but

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
necessarily mean that eggs that but

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.420 
necessarily mean that eggs that but
you'll<00:03:38.810> get<00:03:39.019> mold<00:03:39.290> growth<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.890> then<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
you'll get mold growth and then the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
you'll get mold growth and then the
other<00:03:40.550> thing<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:40.910> look<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.300> as<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.989> total

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
other thing we look for as a total

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.550 
other thing we look for as a total
collapse<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.670> egg<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:45.170> like<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
collapse of the egg not like the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560 
collapse of the egg not like the
dimpling<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.610> spoke<00:03:46.910> about<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.360> last

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
dimpling that I spoke about in the last

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.850 
dimpling that I spoke about in the last
one<00:03:47.810> where<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> little<00:03:48.320> dimples<00:03:48.769> in

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
one where you get a little dimples in

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.650 
one where you get a little dimples in
the<00:03:49.010> egg<00:03:49.130> but<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.850> egg<00:03:49.910> will<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.390> totally

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
the egg but the egg will just totally

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.310 
the egg but the egg will just totally
start<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.019> collapse<00:03:51.350> in<00:03:51.590> on<00:03:51.739> itself<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:53.320> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
start to collapse in on itself and I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.790 
start to collapse in on itself and I
generally<00:03:55.160> try<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.430> cut<00:03:55.670> those<00:03:55.850> out<00:03:56.090> or<00:03:56.299> remove

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
generally try to cut those out or remove

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.220 
generally try to cut those out or remove
from<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.730> batches<00:03:58.270> as<00:03:58.720> soon<00:03:58.900> as<00:03:59.080> they're

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
from the batches as soon as they're

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.090 
from the batches as soon as they're
discovered<00:04:01.800> um

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
discovered um

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.390 
discovered um
I<00:04:03.510> think<00:04:04.510> that's<00:04:04.720> pretty<00:04:05.020> much<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.530> hopefully

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
I think that's pretty much it hopefully

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300 
I think that's pretty much it hopefully
next<00:04:06.610> time<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.350> shoot<00:04:08.350> video<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.740> these<00:04:09.010> it's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
next time I shoot video on these it's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
next time I shoot video on these it's
when<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.000> got<00:04:10.150> little<00:04:10.360> babies<00:04:10.690> Pippin<00:04:11.140> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
when we got little babies Pippin so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.570 
when we got little babies Pippin so
