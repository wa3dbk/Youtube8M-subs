00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
low-end response and finger noise now

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
low-end response and finger noise now
we'll<00:01:58.140> move<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> mic<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.859> that<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.130> directly

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we'll move the mic so that it's directly

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
we'll move the mic so that it's directly
in<00:01:59.909> front<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:00.450> sound<00:02:00.719> hole<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.200> ten

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.060 

this<00:02:29.450> position<00:02:30.020> will<00:02:30.290> reproduce<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.860> most

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
this position will reproduce the most

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.010 
this position will reproduce the most

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
base response from the guitar because

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.780 
base response from the guitar because
it's<00:02:33.200> pointed<00:02:33.560> directly<00:02:33.680> into<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.520> sound

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
