two<00:00:08.180> of<00:00:08.300> the<00:00:08.389> major<00:00:08.630> components<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:09.410> see<00:00:09.440> good

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
two of the major components you see good

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.060 
two of the major components you see good
hitters<00:00:10.400> are<00:00:10.640> rhythm<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:11.540> timing<00:00:12.380> very

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
hitters are rhythm and timing very

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.920 
hitters are rhythm and timing very
important<00:00:13.670> for<00:00:13.820> hitters<00:00:14.000> at<00:00:14.210> all<00:00:14.330> levels<00:00:14.780> to

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
important for hitters at all levels to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.689 
important for hitters at all levels to
have<00:00:15.110> these<00:00:15.320> two<00:00:15.559> things<00:00:15.830> if<00:00:16.039> you<00:00:16.129> watch<00:00:16.340> Major

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
have these two things if you watch Major

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.089 
have these two things if you watch Major
League<00:00:16.999> Baseball<00:00:17.509> players<00:00:17.839> very<00:00:18.289> rarely<00:00:18.800> are

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
League Baseball players very rarely are

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.399 
League Baseball players very rarely are
you<00:00:19.249> gonna<00:00:19.400> see<00:00:19.789> a<00:00:19.999> batter<00:00:20.419> at<00:00:20.720> that<00:00:20.869> level

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:21.409 
you gonna see a batter at that level

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.249 
you gonna see a batter at that level
that<00:00:21.439> stands<00:00:21.919> in<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.189> box<00:00:22.460> stiff<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.449> rigid

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
that stands in the box stiff and rigid

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.649 
that stands in the box stiff and rigid
they're<00:00:24.439> always<00:00:24.650> loose<00:00:25.339> athletic<00:00:26.210> they<00:00:26.449> have

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:26.659 
they're always loose athletic they have

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.450 
they're always loose athletic they have
some<00:00:26.929> rhythm<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.499> what<00:00:27.650> they<00:00:27.769> do<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.189> that's

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
some rhythm to what they do and that's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.130 
some rhythm to what they do and that's
how<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:28.640> want<00:00:28.880> young<00:00:29.150> hitters<00:00:29.480> to<00:00:29.630> hit<00:00:29.810> as<00:00:29.929> well

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
how we want young hitters to hit as well

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.350 
how we want young hitters to hit as well
frees<00:00:30.619> them<00:00:30.859> up<00:00:30.919> some<00:00:31.429> and<00:00:31.699> it<00:00:31.849> actually<00:00:32.060> is

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
frees them up some and it actually is

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.390 
frees them up some and it actually is
going<00:00:32.450> to<00:00:32.510> ultimately<00:00:33.050> lead<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.650> more<00:00:34.160> bat

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
going to ultimately lead to more bat

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.280 
going to ultimately lead to more bat
speed<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.180> usually<00:00:35.540> better<00:00:35.780> more<00:00:36.110> consistent

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
speed and usually better more consistent

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.440 
speed and usually better more consistent
contact<00:00:37.130> a<00:00:37.310> couple<00:00:37.580> of<00:00:37.700> things<00:00:37.910> we<00:00:38.060> like<00:00:38.270> our

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
contact a couple of things we like our

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.780 
contact a couple of things we like our
guys<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.990> remember<00:00:39.440> one<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:40.040> that<00:00:40.490> we<00:00:40.610> always

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
guys to remember one is that we always

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.210 
guys to remember one is that we always
want<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.240> have<00:00:41.420> an<00:00:41.750> athletic<00:00:42.350> foundation

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
want to have an athletic foundation

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.040 
want to have an athletic foundation
athletic<00:00:43.790> base<00:00:44.060> that's<00:00:44.420> what's<00:00:44.600> gonna<00:00:44.720> lead

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
athletic base that's what's gonna lead

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.350 
athletic base that's what's gonna lead
to<00:00:45.110> some<00:00:45.350> good<00:00:45.710> rhythm<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.370> allow<00:00:46.700> us<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.120> move

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
to some good rhythm and allow us to move

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.600 
to some good rhythm and allow us to move
a<00:00:47.630> little<00:00:47.810> bit<00:00:47.960> another<00:00:48.680> thing<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.310> we

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
a little bit another thing is that we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.390 
a little bit another thing is that we
don't<00:00:49.760> want<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.330> stiff<00:00:50.690> tight<00:00:51.110> grip<00:00:51.620> or<00:00:51.920> arms

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
don't want a stiff tight grip or arms

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.850 
don't want a stiff tight grip or arms
again<00:00:52.940> it<00:00:53.120> promotes<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.810> little<00:00:54.410> bit<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.650> rhythm

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
again it promotes a little bit of rhythm

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.130 
again it promotes a little bit of rhythm
and<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.370> ability<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:55.880> move<00:00:56.240> and<00:00:56.690> have<00:00:56.840> loose

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
and the ability to move and have loose

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.830 
and the ability to move and have loose
quick<00:00:57.590> movements<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.520> our<00:00:59.060> swing<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.600> lot<00:00:59.720> of

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
quick movements in our swing a lot of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.990 
quick movements in our swing a lot of
people<00:01:00.110> call<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:00.380> a<00:01:00.590> load<00:01:00.920> some<00:01:01.579> call<00:01:01.820> to

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
people call it a load some call to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.359 
people call it a load some call to
trigger<00:01:02.360> there<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:02.960> some<00:01:03.320> sort<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:03.710> movement

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
trigger there is some sort of movement

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.190 
trigger there is some sort of movement
that<00:01:04.550> helps<00:01:04.940> get<00:01:05.150> this<00:01:05.360> go<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.810> helps<00:01:06.080> the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
that helps get this go and helps the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200 
that helps get this go and helps the
rhythm<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:06.890> stroke<00:01:07.280> as<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.790> pitcher

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
rhythm to this stroke as the pitcher

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.600 
rhythm to this stroke as the pitcher
shows<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.810> his<00:01:09.050> back<00:01:09.350> pocket<00:01:09.650> usually<00:01:10.580> a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
shows you his back pocket usually a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.670 
shows you his back pocket usually a
hitter<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.300> gonna<00:01:11.600> start<00:01:11.990> some<00:01:12.320> sort<00:01:12.560> of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
hitter is gonna start some sort of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.320 
hitter is gonna start some sort of
movement<00:01:12.920> away<00:01:13.250> from<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.670> pitcher<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.180> get

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
movement away from the pitcher to get

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.840 
movement away from the pitcher to get
geared<00:01:14.690> up<00:01:14.870> trigger<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.710> swing<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.430> this

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
geared up trigger the swing and this

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.930 
geared up trigger the swing and this
needs<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.270> be<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.510> slow<00:01:18.080> controlled<00:01:18.940> rhythmic

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
needs to be a slow controlled rhythmic

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.580 
needs to be a slow controlled rhythmic
type<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.330> movement<00:01:20.720> once<00:01:20.930> we've<00:01:21.140> gotten<00:01:21.350> that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
type of movement once we've gotten that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.890 
type of movement once we've gotten that
nice<00:01:21.800> slow<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.190> controlled<00:01:22.630> movement<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.720> get

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
nice slow and controlled movement to get

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.630 
nice slow and controlled movement to get
some<00:01:24.050> rhythm<00:01:24.409> going<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:24.830> our<00:01:24.950> swing<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.460> need

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
some rhythm going in our swing we need

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.520 
some rhythm going in our swing we need
to<00:01:25.790> make<00:01:25.970> sure<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.600> timing<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.290> right

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
to make sure that the timing is right

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.590 
to make sure that the timing is right
with<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.920> pitch<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.430> what<00:01:28.670> we<00:01:28.820> need<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.120> do<00:01:29.420> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
with the pitch and what we need to do is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.780 
with the pitch and what we need to do is
make<00:01:29.840> sure<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.140> if<00:01:30.560> we<00:01:30.680> take<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.950> stride<00:01:31.400> that

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
make sure that if we take a stride that

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.420 
make sure that if we take a stride that
stride<00:01:32.270> foot<00:01:32.630> lands<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.500> time<00:01:33.920> for<00:01:34.190> us<00:01:34.280> to

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
stride foot lands in time for us to

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.789 
stride foot lands in time for us to
attack<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> baseball<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.510> cannot<00:01:35.960> swing<00:01:36.590> in

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
attack the baseball we cannot swing in

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.740 
attack the baseball we cannot swing in
step<00:01:37.130> at<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.400> same<00:01:37.430> time<00:01:37.909> that's<00:01:38.360> not<00:01:38.630> going

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
step at the same time that's not going

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.630 
step at the same time that's not going
to<00:01:38.810> work<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.290> foot<00:01:39.530> has<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.890> come<00:01:40.070> down<00:01:40.280> first

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
to work the foot has to come down first

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.820 
to work the foot has to come down first
and<00:01:40.970> then<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.299> attack

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
and then we attack

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.620 
and then we attack
baseball<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.580> our<00:01:42.790> slow<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.450> controlled

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
baseball so our slow and controlled

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.620 
baseball so our slow and controlled
trigger<00:01:44.530> or<00:01:44.890> load<00:01:45.220> gets<00:01:45.700> us<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> position<00:01:46.270> to

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
trigger or load gets us in a position to

some rhythm but make sure we got that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.330
