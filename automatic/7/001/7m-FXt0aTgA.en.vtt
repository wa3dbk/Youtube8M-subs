00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
probably got very nice short pause what

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.710 
probably got very nice short pause what
about<00:01:57.979> an<00:01:58.130> outstanding<00:01:58.280> two<00:01:59.149> seasons<00:01:59.600> for

a scrum which has swept around very

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.230 
a scrum which has swept around very
messily<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.710> Mendez<00:02:17.310> has<00:02:17.400> been<00:02:17.580> squirted<00:02:17.940> out

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
from his loose head position and is now

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.040 
from his loose head position and is now
lying<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> floor<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.000> Jeff<00:02:21.420> probin<00:02:21.870> is

lying on the floor and Jeff probin is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.900 
lying on the floor and Jeff probin is
coming<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.650> Jeff<00:02:23.250> Hogan<00:02:23.490> his<00:02:23.580> opposite<00:02:23.850> number

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
coming in Jeff Hogan his opposite number

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280 
coming in Jeff Hogan his opposite number
on<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.240> England<00:02:24.480> tight<00:02:24.660> hitters<00:02:24.900> coming<00:02:25.050> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
on the England tight hitters coming in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.900 
on the England tight hitters coming in
and<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.590> makes<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> legitimate<00:02:26.610> attempt

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and I think makes a legitimate attempt

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.260 
and I think makes a legitimate attempt
to<00:02:27.360> avoid<00:02:27.600> him<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> floor<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.880> think<00:02:29.880> it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to avoid him on the floor I think it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.730 
to avoid him on the floor I think it's
great<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.480> believe<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.140> Katherine<00:02:31.590> here<00:02:31.680> in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
great I believe that Katherine here in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.140 
great I believe that Katherine here in
the<00:02:31.800> front<00:02:32.040> row<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.370> think<00:02:32.670> he<00:02:32.760> tries<00:02:32.970> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the front row but I think he tries to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
the front row but I think he tries to
step<00:02:33.570> over<00:02:33.630> him<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.410> Mendes<00:02:34.950> then

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
step over him then but Mendes then

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420 
step over him then but Mendes then
strikes<00:02:36.060> probing<00:02:36.780> from<00:02:37.140> beneath<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.250> most
