00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.870 
Jonathan time with you today we just got
five<00:00:09.059> GS<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.019> 5d<00:00:10.469> s<00:00:10.650> are<00:00:10.920> from<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.550> so

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
five GS and the 5d s are from can so

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.640 
five GS and the 5d s are from can so
first<00:00:12.420> few<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:12.960> cameras<00:00:13.440> they're

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
first few of these cameras they're

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
first few of these cameras they're
exactly<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.250> same<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> 5d<00:00:15.299> mark<00:00:15.540> 3<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
exactly the same like the 5d mark 3 the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920 
exactly the same like the 5d mark 3 the
only<00:00:16.680> difference<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.210> nothing<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.690> grip<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
only difference is nothing the grip is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.450 
only difference is nothing the grip is
the<00:00:19.109> same<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.650> placement<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> same

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the same but placement is the same

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.480 
the same but placement is the same
account<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.330> exactly<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.560> same<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.220> like

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
account to exactly the same it's like

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.380 
account to exactly the same it's like
the<00:00:23.670> 5d<00:00:24.150> mark<00:00:24.420> 3<00:00:25.099> 1250<00:00:26.099> megapixels<00:00:26.730> what's<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the 5d mark 3 1250 megapixels what's the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.410 
the 5d mark 3 1250 megapixels what's the
difference<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.930> 5d<00:00:28.890> s<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.490> has<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
difference the 5d s are has a little

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
difference the 5d s are has a little
pass<00:00:30.599> filter<00:00:31.050> static<00:00:31.470> fatigue<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
pass filter static fatigue so does that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.600 
pass filter static fatigue so does that
mean<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.180> has<00:00:33.360> their<00:00:33.690> sharper<00:00:34.350> images<00:00:34.829> one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
mean it has their sharper images one

negative thing about it is there's a
higher<00:00:37.469> possibility<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> moria<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
higher possibility of moria so I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.119 
higher possibility of moria so I

one<00:00:48.090> thing<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.870> 59<00:00:49.289> crystals<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
one thing about the 59 crystals that I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
one thing about the 59 crystals that I
really<00:00:50.190> love<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.850> fact<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> crop

the<00:00:55.620> fact<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> camera<00:00:56.430> comes<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the fact that the camera comes with the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
the fact that the camera comes with the
problem<00:00:57.600> settings<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> crop

problem settings to be like a crop
sensor<00:00:59.489> camera<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.809> chemists<00:01:01.170> have

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
sensor camera so these chemists have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
sensor camera so these chemists have
dual<00:01:01.559> digits<00:01:01.949> fixed<00:01:02.219> processors<00:01:03.019> amazing<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
dual digits fixed processors amazing it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
dual digits fixed processors amazing it
needs<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.010> strong<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.790> unit<00:01:06.060> process

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
needs something strong that unit process

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.380 
needs something strong that unit process
is<00:01:06.840> 50<00:01:07.229> mega<00:01:07.439> pixels<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.430> once<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is 50 mega pixels at all at once so the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
is 50 mega pixels at all at once so the
first<00:01:09.570> shooting<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.049> five<00:01:10.409> frames<00:01:10.799> per<00:01:11.010> second

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
first shooting is five frames per second

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
first shooting is five frames per second
it's<00:01:11.580> less<00:01:11.790> than<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.090> 5d<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.659> six<00:01:12.990> frames<00:01:13.200> per

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's less than the 5d at six frames per

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
it's less than the 5d at six frames per
second<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.220> shooting<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.030> 50<00:01:15.479> many<00:01:15.689> pixels

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
second but shooting at 50 many pixels

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.130 
second but shooting at 50 many pixels
all<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.770> lunch<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.580> camera<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.140> beasting

571 to the IFF of the local 64 mention a
mark<00:01:25.729> Greene<00:01:25.970> goes<00:01:26.150> way<00:01:26.570> higher<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.979> same

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
mark Greene goes way higher but the same

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.770 
mark Greene goes way higher but the same
thing<00:01:28.670> at<00:01:29.030> 6,400<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.320> same<00:01:30.590> thing<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.600> for

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
video the 5d Mark Green and surprise me

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.950 
video the 5d Mark Green and surprise me
esta<00:01:36.229> my<00:01:36.440> kids<00:01:36.740> are<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.520> same<00:01:37.670> thing<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.630> only

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.260 
thing is it has a tab of 6,400 iso and
no<00:01:42.740> headphone<00:01:43.100> jack<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.520> really<00:01:43.940> cool<00:01:44.119> feature

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
no headphone jack a really cool feature

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.359 
no headphone jack a really cool feature
is<00:01:44.479> they<00:01:44.720> reinvented<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.530> mirror<00:01:45.800> flip<00:01:46.159> up

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
is they reinvented the mirror flip up

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.550 
is they reinvented the mirror flip up
which<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.000> increases<00:01:47.509> blur<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.259> can<00:01:48.380> even

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
which then increases blur you can even

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.280 
which then increases blur you can even
do<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.860> barrel<00:01:49.190> aqua<00:01:49.490> by<00:01:49.729> simply<00:01:50.119> pressing<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
do a barrel aqua by simply pressing the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.469 
do a barrel aqua by simply pressing the
shutter<00:01:51.470> button<00:01:51.590> twice<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> five<00:01:52.970> vs<00:01:53.270> are

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
shutter button twice so the five vs are

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.240 
shutter button twice so the five vs are
perfect<00:01:53.990> for<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> landscape<00:01:54.649> photographers

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
