00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
word with Tommy to find out if he really

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
word with Tommy to find out if he really
thought<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> could<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> year<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
thought that this could be the year so

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499

maybe<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.979> mean<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.460> been<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> huge<00:01:33.479> part<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> my

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
maybe I mean it's been a huge part of my

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
maybe I mean it's been a huge part of my
life<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> decade<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.400> hard<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
life for a decade now and it's hard to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
life for a decade now and it's hard to
imagine<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:36.420> having<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> thing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
imagine not having that as the thing

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.240 
imagine not having that as the thing
that<00:01:37.860> drives<00:01:38.100> me<00:01:38.460> every<00:01:38.640> day<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.009> think

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that drives me every day but I think

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
that drives me every day but I think
it's<00:01:41.340> getting<00:01:41.490> closer<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> giant

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's getting closer it's it's a giant

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.710 
it's getting closer it's it's a giant
project<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.820> step<00:01:45.060> back<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.540> tell

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
project how much was step back to tell

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you when you've had a long period of it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.139 
you when you've had a long period of it
do<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.040> remember<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.030> the

you have to rework stuff you have to do
it<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> rework<00:01:52.229> stuff<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> mean<00:01:52.950> there's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it I have to rework stuff I mean there's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
it I have to rework stuff I mean there's
a<00:01:53.159> lot<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.610> pictures<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.840> my

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a lot of pictures that are right at my

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
a lot of pictures that are right at my
limit<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> muscle

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909

limit so you have to get the muscle
memory<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> relearn

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
memory thing going you have to relearn

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
memory thing going you have to relearn
the<00:01:58.950> intricacies<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.780> incredibly

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the intricacies it's it's incredibly

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
the intricacies it's it's incredibly
technical<00:02:01.890> climbing<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
technical climbing so if you're just a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
technical climbing so if you're just a
tiny<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.950> position<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.640> fall<00:02:05.850> off

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
tiny bit out of position you fall off

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
tiny bit out of position you fall off
and<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.479> takes<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.780> bit<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> relearn<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and it takes a bit to relearn all of

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
and it takes a bit to relearn all of
that<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.580> say<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.119> takes<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> solid

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that I would say it takes me a solid
