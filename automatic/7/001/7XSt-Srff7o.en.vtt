00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 GrÃ¼ezi and hello just pack 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.480
 today there is a children locomotive 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.630
 pie we start right with the wheels 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.170
 I have two plates one bright 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.930
 a dark rolled out behind it 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 I look at the boys and at the same time 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.010
 with a flower cookie cutter the circles 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.670
 I fill them again with the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 darken it looks like that afterwards 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.600
 then I imagine the desired 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 number of pieces and pack at 190 degrees 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 ten minutes further on it goes with it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 the base plate where then the whole pie 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 that comes up I have me green 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.600
 packed and give now with brown 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 fatih seemed on top of that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.620
 you have to owe him the video 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.940
 a bit faster otherwise he will 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 you probably the face 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 fall asleep me in the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
 comments what you think it will be 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 I would rather have it longer 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.270
 also really step by step 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 I think that's what I think 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.080
 probably already enough 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 so it was still put on and the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.450
 between now completely with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 chocolate on there will be one more 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.880
 Great effect and really 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 almost like a real railroad track 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 looks 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.730
 The brush I feel there now beautiful 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 exactly the spaces between so 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:51.660
 Let's break off and keep going 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.660
 the bisky and there would be my videos knows 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.120
 He always knows that 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.720
 had prepared dead frame and me then 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.580
 the cake cut out because there is otherwise 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.780
 another video on my channel 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.229
 top part I have a bit 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.090
 increased and just another piece 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.040
 put on it not just glued the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.540
 also not painted pages 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.959
 just so then with taken from there 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 that holds that I have also skipped 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.880
 to accelerate the time a bit 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.709
 Now we see again the speech of 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 At the beginning I bring that to the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.370
 I told myself at 190 degrees about 10 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:44.660
 minutes baked the gate of the pretty 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:49.430
 large easily for itself 25 people 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.440
 so maybe it works a bit 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 a bit clumsy but I think for one 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 Children's birthday is sure good because 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 we then do the decoration with the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.980
 gummy bears and biscuits and all that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.980
 continue 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.650
 I also think it is simply 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.480
 grab me and you have to 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.160
 really not every decoration 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.270
 make yourself 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.790
 You can also rely on tried and true 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:32.000
 resort to home remedies under otherwise hab 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.880
 sometimes buy something as there is like me 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.630
 the filled biscuits me easily and sets 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.630
 youth on it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:07.060
 second change I always twice biscuits 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.530
 and three gummy bears I thought 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 Actually also that not always 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.939
 the same color gummy bears 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.049
 next to each other is visually still a good one 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.049
 to achieve evaluation 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.590
 so a bit smarty is then so 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.340
 our on for the colors one more 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.750
 to emphasize a bit more 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.370
 but you have that you can decorate 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.480
 how you want me to get up now 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.360
 a simple variant in the team had to be there 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.900
 also go a bit fast and 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 so now we're doing that 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.180
 Interspaces a connection between 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.440
 the wagons and loks are still here 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.840
 volcano candle vorderst there take 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.150
 I like the villages there black 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.520
 dyed roll makes me look skinny 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.730
 as a model her rod one 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.210
 small hole with me then that there 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.620
 can insert 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.090
 I do not give it any other way 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.590
 really a bit in the lead 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.590
 and then that's no problem 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.360
 I hope we the Germans and the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:43.139
 Austrian friends who understand 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.610
 I'm going to last for the last time 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.610
 sorry for that last time 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:58.199
 the connections are ready and soon 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.570
 so the trotters will do something soon 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:04.460
 now the decoration with white 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.229
 Add the windows to ours 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:12.479
 then I will still with the base plate 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:13.350
 consider a little flowers and that's it 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.430
 then already 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.430
 if simple tart a bit more 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.510
 I spent the others until I was up 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.450
 have shown now 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.240
 That's it, give me thumbs up 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.169
 until next time your marcel von 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.169
 just pack
