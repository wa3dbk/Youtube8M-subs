00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
if you had a car that was really looking

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.469 
if you had a car that was really looking
like<00:05:30.930> worn<00:05:31.530> down<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.220> really<00:05:32.970> looked<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:33.360> it

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
like worn down and really looked like it

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.629 
like worn down and really looked like it
was<00:05:33.599> in<00:05:33.630> rough<00:05:33.900> shape<00:05:33.960> then<00:05:34.470> it<00:05:34.979> would<00:05:35.130> have<00:05:35.340> so

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
was in rough shape then it would have so

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.310 
was in rough shape then it would have so
much<00:05:35.699> more<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.090> an<00:05:36.180> impact<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.780> was<00:05:36.960> really

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
much more of an impact it was really

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.110 
much more of an impact it was really
tough<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.560> see<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.159> camera<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.849> don't

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
tough to see it on the camera so I don't

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.640 
tough to see it on the camera so I don't
even<00:05:39.210> know<00:05:39.389> if<00:05:39.479> you'll<00:05:39.599> be<00:05:39.750> able<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.050> see<00:05:40.320> the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
even know if you'll be able to see the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.740 
even know if you'll be able to see the
real<00:05:40.860> difference<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.610> saw<00:05:41.849> a<00:05:41.909> much<00:05:42.210> bigger

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
real difference and I saw a much bigger

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.399 
real difference and I saw a much bigger
difference<00:05:43.260> on<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.729> black<00:05:45.090> that<00:05:45.750> was<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.289> the

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
difference on the black that was in the

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.560 
difference on the black that was in the
middle<00:05:46.620> of<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.919> more<00:05:47.250> than<00:05:47.490> on<00:05:47.699> the<00:05:47.789> car<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:48.330> the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
middle of it more than on the car so the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.930 
middle of it more than on the car so the
yellow<00:05:48.810> was<00:05:49.110> not<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.470> best<00:05:49.710> color<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.400> use<00:05:50.729> as

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
yellow was not the best color to use as

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.760 
yellow was not the best color to use as
it<00:05:51.090> as<00:05:51.270> an<00:05:51.449> example<00:05:51.509> but<00:05:52.139> overall<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:52.590> would

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
it as an example but overall I would

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.770 
it as an example but overall I would
recommend<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.580> it's<00:05:54.060> funny<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.389> don't<00:05:54.630> know<00:05:54.690> if

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
recommend it it's funny I don't know if

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.390 
recommend it it's funny I don't know if
I<00:05:54.870> mentioned<00:05:54.930> this<00:05:55.229> right<00:05:55.530> but<00:05:55.710> I<00:05:55.770> got<00:05:55.979> some<00:05:56.280> of

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379 
the the lights came out with this color

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.499 
the the lights came out with this color
back<00:06:27.620> stuff<00:06:27.919> because<00:06:28.129> it<00:06:28.249> says<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.849> remove

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
back stuff because it says to remove

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.300 
back stuff because it says to remove
oxidation<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.319> that's<00:06:30.469> exactly<00:06:30.949> what<00:06:31.069> it<00:06:31.189> did

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
oxidation and that's exactly what it did

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.019 
oxidation and that's exactly what it did
on<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.550> lights

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029
