00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.720 
sprite sprite kits animation methods
animation<00:00:15.780> class<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> we'll<00:00:17.279> delete<00:00:17.550> that

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
animation class so we'll delete that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.970 
animation class so we'll delete that
first<00:00:18.119> rectangle<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.439> set<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> 10<00:00:19.830> by

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
first rectangle so we just set the 10 by

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.370 
first rectangle so we just set the 10 by
10<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.640> we'll<00:00:21.270> go<00:00:21.420> ahead<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.750> make<00:00:21.900> an<00:00:22.020> sk

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
10 and we'll go ahead and make an sk

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.220 
10 and we'll go ahead and make an sk
action<00:00:22.920> variable<00:00:27.170> give<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.320> instance<00:00:30.230> clout

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
action variable give your instance clout

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.049 
action variable give your instance clout
the<00:00:31.320> fade<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> run<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the fade out and we're going to run the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.290 
the fade out and we're going to run the
sk<00:00:33.510> action<00:00:34.140> fade<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:35.100> duration<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
sk action fade out with duration one and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.700 
sk action fade out with duration one and
that's<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.350> fades<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.190> basically<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
that's it fades out basically over a

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
that's it fades out basically over a
period<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.100> second<00:00:42.739> yeah<00:00:43.969> ok<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
period of one second yeah ok and then

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.180 
period of one second yeah ok and then
we'll<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.660> another<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.020> fade<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.070> will

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we'll make another one fade in that will

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
we'll make another one fade in that will
fade<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.520> /<00:00:47.640> duration<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.600> second<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
fade in / duration of one second and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
fade in / duration of one second and
basically<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.860> animations

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
basically these are just the animations

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.170 
basically these are just the animations
themselves<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:54.000> do

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
themselves they don't actually do

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 
themselves they don't actually do
anything<00:00:54.210> until<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.230> run<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.550> we'll

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
anything until they are run so we'll

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.529 
anything until they are run so we'll
make<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.480> call<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> move<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.539> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
make one more call to move to but you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
make one more call to move to but you
can't<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> run<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.649> themselves<00:01:04.100> we'll

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
can't just run these by themselves we'll

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.850 
can't just run these by themselves we'll
move<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.170> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> run<00:01:07.590> them

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
move to a point you have to run them

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
move to a point you have to run them
with<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.700> method<00:01:10.790> ok<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> move

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
with a method ok so we're going to move

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.280 
with a method ok so we're going to move
to<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.750> CG<00:01:13.140> point<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:17.840> move<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.460> 100<00:01:20.460> 100

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
to a CG point and move them to 100 100

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
to a CG point and move them to 100 100
over<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> period<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> second

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.190 

okay<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.289> have<00:01:34.530> two<00:01:35.299> well<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:36.719> put<00:01:36.960> them

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
okay now we have two well let's put them

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.169 
okay now we have two well let's put them
in<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.789> that<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:40.549> well<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.909> called<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
in a with so that we well it's called a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.270 
in a with so that we well it's called a
sequence<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.319> to<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
sequence so that we don't have to do we

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
sequence so that we don't have to do we
don't<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> run<00:01:45.149> each<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.569> them

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
don't have to run each of them

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
don't have to run each of them
separately<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.069> run<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.429> whole

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
separately we can just run the whole

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
separately we can just run the whole
list<00:01:47.819> of<00:01:47.969> them<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> we'll<00:01:48.569> there<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.709> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
list of them and we'll there you have to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.059 
list of them and we'll there you have to
make<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.069> NS<00:01:50.340> array<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.590> first<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.039> is

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
make an NS array and the first one is

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.100 
make an NS array and the first one is
going<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.819> fade<00:01:57.179> out<00:01:59.539> then<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.899> move

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
going to be fade out then and then move

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
going to be fade out then and then move
to<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.590> basically<00:02:02.039> our<00:02:02.069> our<00:02:02.610> squares<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.239> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to so basically our our squares going to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
to so basically our our squares going to
fade<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.959> it's<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.319> to<00:02:04.380> fit<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.619> an

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
fade out and it's going to fit in an

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180 
fade out and it's going to fit in an
instant<00:02:05.099> and<00:02:05.159> move<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> 100<00:02:05.939> 100<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
instant and move to a 100 100 but this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.729 
instant and move to a 100 100 but this
still<00:02:08.489> has<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.940> called<00:02:09.329> as<00:02:10.079> we<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.500> see

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
still has to be called as we can see

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.750 
still has to be called as we can see
this<00:02:11.190> won't<00:02:11.489> happen<00:02:11.700> because<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:13.760> those

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
this won't happen because the those

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.100 
this won't happen because the those
animation<00:02:15.680> things<00:02:16.680> never<00:02:17.810> never<00:02:18.810> actually

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
animation things never never actually

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.650 
animation things never never actually
get<00:02:19.500> run<00:02:19.799> they're<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:21.860> they're<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.660> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
get run they're just they're kind of so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.910 
get run they're just they're kind of so
to<00:02:25.170> run<00:02:25.410> them<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.760> say<00:02:27.709> let's<00:02:28.709> give

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
to run them we have to say let's give

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.590 
to run them we have to say let's give
this<00:02:29.069> bottom<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.930> bottom<00:02:30.930> bar<00:02:32.150> self<00:02:33.150> third

to run we could run fade out but we were

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
to run we could run fade out but we were
going<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.889> run<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.609> we<00:02:44.819> run<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.389> ran

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
going to run like if we run if we ran

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.020 
going to run like if we run if we ran
fade<00:02:46.019> out<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> would<00:02:46.769> just<00:02:46.799> fade<00:02:47.220> out<00:02:47.400> but

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
fade out then it would just fade out but

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.220 
fade out then it would just fade out but
we're<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.269> run<00:02:48.420> our<00:02:48.569> sequence<00:02:48.989> called

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
we're going to run our sequence called

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:00.990 
we're going to run our sequence called
all

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.670 

so<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.020> faded<00:03:02.350> out<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.710> it<00:03:02.800> faded<00:03:03.070> in<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.290> it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
so it faded out and it faded in but it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.640 
so it faded out and it faded in but it
didn't<00:03:06.070> we<00:03:06.190> didn't<00:03:06.400> use<00:03:06.580> them<00:03:06.760> move<00:03:06.970> function

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.900 

will<00:03:11.650> do<00:03:11.770> that<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> second<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.550> we're<00:03:12.790> going

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
will do that in a second but we're going

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.140 
will do that in a second but we're going
to<00:03:12.970> repeat<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:14.080> sequence<00:03:14.740> forever<00:03:15.160> using

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to repeat that sequence forever using

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.330 
to repeat that sequence forever using
the<00:03:16.270> repeat<00:03:16.660> action<00:03:16.840> forever<00:03:17.230> method<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.920> SK

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the repeat action forever method of SK

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.690 
the repeat action forever method of SK
action<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.660> we'll<00:03:20.650> call<00:03:20.860> repeat<00:03:21.280> rather

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
action and then we'll call repeat rather

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520 
action and then we'll call repeat rather
than<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.330> we<00:03:22.450> going<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.660> run<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> edge<00:03:22.990> repeat

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
than are we going to run the edge repeat

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.250 
than are we going to run the edge repeat
rather<00:03:23.890> than<00:03:24.160> all<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.780> now<00:03:25.900> it'll<00:03:26.050> just

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
rather than all and so now it'll just

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
rather than all and so now it'll just
fade<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.680> out<00:03:26.860> forever<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.640> ever<00:03:30.300> okay<00:03:31.300> so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
fade in and out forever and ever okay so

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.590 
fade in and out forever and ever okay so
now<00:03:32.290> I'll<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:32.950> move<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.570> 100<00:03:34.570> 100

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
now I'll have it and move to 100 100

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.500 
now I'll have it and move to 100 100
feet<00:03:37.600> outfit<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.200> move<00:03:39.190> 200<00:03:39.610> hundred<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.360> only

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
feet outfit in move 200 hundred the only

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.780 
feet outfit in move 200 hundred the only
problem<00:03:40.690> with<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.020> is<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.920> once<00:03:42.640> it's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
problem with this is that it once it's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.460 
problem with this is that it once it's
out<00:03:42.850> 100<00:03:43.209> 100<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> keeps<00:03:43.930> trying<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.200> move<00:03:44.350> to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
out 100 100 it keeps trying to move to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.320 
out 100 100 it keeps trying to move to
100<00:03:44.770> 100<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.370> already<00:03:45.580> there<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.270> it

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
100 100 and it's already there so it

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.670 
100 100 and it's already there so it
doesn't<00:03:46.540> look<00:03:46.690> like<00:03:46.750> anything's<00:03:47.290> happening

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
doesn't look like anything's happening

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.280 
doesn't look like anything's happening
so<00:03:48.430> let's<00:03:49.030> make<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.420> kind<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.720> cooler<00:03:49.959> and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
so let's make this kind of cooler and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.940 
so let's make this kind of cooler and
we'll<00:03:50.530> make<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> second<00:03:51.340> move<00:03:51.489> point<00:03:52.950> which

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
we'll make a second move point which

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.530 
we'll make a second move point which
will<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:56.470> center<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.280> screen<00:03:57.520> so<00:03:58.450> what

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
will be the center of the screen so what

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.420 
will be the center of the screen so what
we're<00:03:58.660> going<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.840> do<00:03:58.989> self<00:03:59.560> dot<00:03:59.830> framed<00:04:00.220> out

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
we're going to do self dot framed out

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.520 
we're going to do self dot framed out
sized<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:01.030> with<00:04:01.209> /<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.020> same<00:04:02.230> thing<00:04:02.410> we

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
sized up with / to the same thing we

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.710 
sized up with / to the same thing we
used<00:04:02.560> earlier<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:06.120> we're<00:04:07.120> going<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.330> do<00:04:07.420> soft

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
used earlier and we're going to do soft

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.470 
used earlier and we're going to do soft
up<00:04:07.959> frame<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.560> size<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.070> height<00:04:09.400> /<00:04:09.820> 2<00:04:10.060> as

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
up frame that size the height / 2 as

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.990 
up frame that size the height / 2 as
well<00:04:10.890> you'll<00:04:11.890> get<00:04:12.100> used<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.340> typing<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.820> in

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
well you'll get used to typing that in

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.770 
well you'll get used to typing that in
it<00:04:13.150> gets<00:04:13.900> used<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.260> lot<00:04:14.940> for<00:04:15.940> games<00:04:16.650> okay<00:04:18.780> hey

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it gets used a lot for games okay hey

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.560 
it gets used a lot for games okay hey
sorry<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.729> we<00:04:21.729> have<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:21.940> make<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.210> CG

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
sorry and we have to make that a CG

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.360 
sorry and we have to make that a CG
point

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.740 

and<00:04:30.729> we'll<00:04:31.479> make<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.660> happen<00:04:31.840> over<00:04:32.199> one<00:04:32.350> second

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
and we'll make it happen over one second

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.629 
and we'll make it happen over one second
okay<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:34.810> it's<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.919> moves<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:39.370> center

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
okay so it's that moves it to the center

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.129 
okay so it's that moves it to the center
of<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.790> screen<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.389> we're<00:04:40.630> going<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.810> move<00:04:41.020> it

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
of the screen so we're going to move it

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.689 
of the screen so we're going to move it
to<00:04:41.169> 100<00:04:41.350> 100<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:41.979> then<00:04:42.070> move<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.580> side

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
to 100 100 and then move it to the side

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.730 
to 100 100 and then move it to the side
of<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> screen<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:44.050> it's<00:04:44.169> going<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.350> fade<00:04:44.560> out

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
of the screen so it's going to fade out

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.770 
of the screen so it's going to fade out
fading<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.280> move<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.669> 100<00:04:46.210> move<00:04:46.449> back<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.750> the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
fading and move to 100 move back to the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.360 
fading and move to 100 move back to the
center<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.169> then<00:04:47.260> do<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.919> forever<00:04:51.780> okay<00:04:53.370> so

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
center and then do it forever okay so

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.360 
center and then do it forever okay so
what<00:04:54.610> if<00:04:54.699> we<00:04:54.790> want<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.290> have<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.500> fade<00:04:56.830> out<00:04:57.070> and

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
what if we want to have it fade out and

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.610 
what if we want to have it fade out and
move<00:04:58.000> at<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.300> same<00:04:58.510> time<00:04:58.780> or<00:04:58.990> fade<00:04:59.229> in<00:04:59.410> and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
move at the same time or fade in and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.469 
move at the same time or fade in and
move<00:04:59.830> at<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.040> same<00:05:00.190> time<00:05:00.400> we<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.030> create<00:05:01.360> a

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
move at the same time we can create a

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.610 
move at the same time we can create a
group<00:05:01.750> right<00:05:01.960> now<00:05:01.990> these<00:05:02.290> happens

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
group right now these happens

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.219 
group right now these happens
sequentially<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:04.060> if<00:05:04.270> we<00:05:04.330> want<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.020> happen

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
sequentially but if we want to to happen

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.570 
sequentially but if we want to to happen
at<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.350> same<00:05:05.380> time<00:05:05.620> we<00:05:05.770> can<00:05:05.889> make<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.070> group<00:05:06.400> of

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
at the same time we can make a group of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.990 
at the same time we can make a group of
actions<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:09.010> do<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.280> by<00:05:09.340> running<00:05:09.760> the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
actions and you do that by running the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.070 
actions and you do that by running the
method<00:05:10.270> group<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.810> that's<00:05:10.990> just<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.320> list<00:05:11.590> of

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
method group and that's just a list of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.040 
method group and that's just a list of
actions<00:05:14.080> again<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.940> we're<00:05:16.270> going<00:05:16.389> to<00:05:16.479> do<00:05:16.690> fade

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
actions again so we're going to do fade

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.520 
actions again so we're going to do fade
in<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:20.400> then<00:05:21.400> move<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:23.080> those<00:05:23.229> will<00:05:23.350> both

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
in and then move to so those will both

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.430 
in and then move to so those will both
happen<00:05:23.919> at<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.190> same<00:05:24.220> time<00:05:24.789> when<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.440> group

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
happen at the same time when that group

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.070 
happen at the same time when that group
runs<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.400> we're<00:05:28.300> going<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:28.449> make<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.630> second

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
runs and we're going to make a second

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.270 
runs and we're going to make a second
group<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:33.580> will<00:05:33.850> use<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.960> move<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.500> action

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
group that will use the move to action

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.500 
group that will use the move to action
that<00:05:36.639> will<00:05:36.760> move<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.570> center

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.440 

okay<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.740> we'll<00:05:46.340> name<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.700> first<00:05:46.910> one<00:05:47.150> we'll

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
okay and we'll name the first one we'll

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.410 
okay and we'll name the first one we'll
name<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.750> variable<00:05:48.110> Group<00:05:48.290> one<00:05:49.180> don't<00:05:50.180> miss

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
name that variable Group one don't miss

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.300 
name that variable Group one don't miss
that<00:05:50.600> back<00:05:50.840> sent<00:05:51.140> okay<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.680> then<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:51.920> one<00:05:51.980> be

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that back sent okay and then this one be

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.750 
that back sent okay and then this one be
moved<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.760> two<00:05:54.760> all<00:05:55.760> right<00:05:57.100> I'm<00:05:58.100> missing<00:05:58.670> a

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
moved to two all right I'm missing a

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:09.010 
moved to two all right I'm missing a
bracket<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.930> doesn't<00:06:03.200> like<00:06:03.380> that<00:06:06.370> so<00:06:08.020> we'll

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
bracket it doesn't like that so we'll

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.860 
bracket it doesn't like that so we'll
replace<00:06:09.440> those<00:06:09.740> with<00:06:09.800> group<00:06:10.220> 1<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.820> group<00:06:10.910> 2

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:25.420 

gotta<00:06:17.870> fix<00:06:18.050> those<00:06:18.260> brackets<00:06:18.530> still<00:06:23.950> okay<00:06:24.950> now

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
gotta fix those brackets still okay now

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.650 
gotta fix those brackets still okay now
it<00:06:25.490> should<00:06:25.670> work<00:06:27.790> okay<00:06:28.790> see<00:06:28.850> how<00:06:29.030> it's<00:06:29.210> fading

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
it should work okay see how it's fading

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.720 
it should work okay see how it's fading
in<00:06:29.780> and<00:06:29.870> moving<00:06:30.170> at<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.500> same<00:06:30.650> time<00:06:30.920> that's

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
in and moving at the same time that's

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.670 
in and moving at the same time that's
running<00:06:32.030> two<00:06:32.330> animations<00:06:32.810> at<00:06:33.140> once<00:06:33.380> as<00:06:33.620> a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
running two animations at once as a

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.250 
running two animations at once as a
group<00:06:34.190> which<00:06:35.120> is<00:06:35.270> really<00:06:35.450> useful<00:06:35.630> without

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
group which is really useful without

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.160 
group which is really useful without
that<00:06:36.650> you<00:06:36.920> would<00:06:37.070> have<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:37.430> do<00:06:37.550> everything

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
that you would have to do everything

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.220 
that you would have to do everything
like<00:06:39.170> in<00:06:39.560> order<00:06:40.570> you'd<00:06:41.570> have<00:06:41.660> to<00:06:41.720> wait<00:06:41.960> for<00:06:42.200> the

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
like in order you'd have to wait for the

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.590 
like in order you'd have to wait for the
last<00:06:42.590> animation<00:06:43.310> finish<00:06:43.700> to<00:06:43.820> do<00:06:43.940> that<00:06:44.090> so

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
last animation finish to do that so

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.910 
last animation finish to do that so
that's<00:06:44.810> it<00:06:45.020> for<00:06:45.050> this<00:06:45.260> video<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.770> next

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
that's it for this video and the next

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.710 
that's it for this video and the next
one<00:06:46.070> will<00:06:46.220> be<00:06:46.250> making<00:06:46.550> sprite<00:06:47.120> nodes<00:06:47.450> from

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
one will be making sprite nodes from

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.110 
one will be making sprite nodes from
