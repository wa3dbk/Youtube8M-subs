go I simply disconnect a USB cable from

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.510 
go I simply disconnect a USB cable from
the<00:01:13.470> header<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:17.180> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.360> follow<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> cable

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
the header and if you follow the cable

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
the header and if you follow the cable
right<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.600> front<00:01:22.049> panel<00:01:27.200> if<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> try<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
right up to the front panel if I try to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.030 
right up to the front panel if I try to
zoom<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.189> closer<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
zoom a bit closer you can see the right

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.330

USB<00:01:32.040> port<00:01:32.570> looks<00:01:33.570> damaged<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.560> black<00:01:34.860> tab<00:01:35.159> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
USB port looks damaged the black tab is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
USB port looks damaged the black tab is
missing<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> left<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.810> okay<00:01:37.140> my

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
missing but the left one is okay my

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.910 
missing but the left one is okay my
guess<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.299> due<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> maybe<00:01:40.380> inserting

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
guess is it was due to maybe inserting

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
guess is it was due to maybe inserting
or<00:01:41.040> removing<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.640> dodgy<00:01:42.180> USB<00:01:42.540> stick<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
or removing a dodgy USB stick or just a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
or removing a dodgy USB stick or just a
normal<00:01:43.710> USB<00:01:43.920> stick<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.549> broke<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
normal USB stick but it just broke and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.630 
normal USB stick but it just broke and
that<00:01:45.149> caused<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.659> short<00:01:45.930> circuit<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.869> hopefully

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
that caused a short circuit so hopefully

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.810 
that caused a short circuit so hopefully
this<00:01:50.640> should<00:01:50.880> fix<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.110> ahead<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.820> pop

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
this should fix it so go ahead and pop

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:06.080 
this should fix it so go ahead and pop
the<00:01:55.460> power<00:01:56.460> cable<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:56.969> in

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.670 

let's<00:02:07.090> turn<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.540> power<00:02:07.720> back<00:02:07.750> on<00:02:08.110> and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.220 

hopefully<00:02:12.120> fingers<00:02:13.120> crossed<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.930> Asus

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
hopefully fingers crossed see the Asus

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.940 
hopefully fingers crossed see the Asus
logo<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.030> looks<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.090> something<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.630> loading
