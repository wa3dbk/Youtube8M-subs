is<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.220> our<00:03:09.549> purpose<00:03:10.000> was<00:03:10.450> not<00:03:10.480> met<00:03:10.989> by

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
is that is our purpose was not met by

is that is our purpose was not met by
what<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.739> found<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.310> dirt<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.879> it<00:03:13.299> doesn't

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
what we found in the dirt and it doesn't

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.330 
what we found in the dirt and it doesn't
appear<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.049> be<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.590> fact<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:14.950> there's<00:03:15.220> going

Native American mountain so we made some

Native American mountain so we made some
nice<00:03:23.349> discoveries<00:03:24.040> but<00:03:24.609> in<00:03:24.730> terms<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.150> being

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
nice discoveries but in terms of being

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.569 
nice discoveries but in terms of being
able<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.780> push<00:03:26.079> our<00:03:26.290> envelope<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.099> knowledge

into the hole dug it all out by hand but

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.670 
into the hole dug it all out by hand but
it's<00:03:37.540> all<00:03:37.690> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.930> go<00:03:38.079> back<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.530> my

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
it's all going to go back in my

it's all going to go back in my
equipment<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.730> then<00:03:39.879> we'll<00:03:40.030> put<00:03:40.180> grass

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
