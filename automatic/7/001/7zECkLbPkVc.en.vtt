00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey guys so the biggest difference

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.560 
hey guys so the biggest difference
between<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> guitar<00:00:02.669> player<00:00:02.760> who<00:00:03.030> knows<00:00:03.300> what

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
between a guitar player who knows what

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.090 
between a guitar player who knows what
he's<00:00:03.659> doing<00:00:03.959> from<00:00:04.440> guitar<00:00:04.799> player<00:00:04.980> who

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
he's doing from guitar player who

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.559 
he's doing from guitar player who
doesn't<00:00:05.460> know<00:00:05.580> what<00:00:06.000> they're<00:00:06.150> doing<00:00:06.450> is

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
doesn't know what they're doing is

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.190 
doesn't know what they're doing is
whether<00:00:07.379> or<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:07.620> he<00:00:07.980> or<00:00:08.280> she<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.630> properly

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
whether or not he or she can properly

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.220 
whether or not he or she can properly
identify<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.610> notes<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> guitar<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
identify the notes on a guitar and the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
identify the notes on a guitar and the
reason<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.559> say<00:00:13.590> properly<00:00:14.549> identify<00:00:15.269> their

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
reason I say properly identify their

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.349 
reason I say properly identify their
notes<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:16.020> opposed<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.680> knows<00:00:17.310> their<00:00:17.820> notes<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
notes as opposed to knows their notes is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.290 
notes as opposed to knows their notes is
you<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.770> go<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
you don't really just go out and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
you don't really just go out and
memorize<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.660> your<00:00:21.900> notes<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.680> do

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
memorize all your notes what you do

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
memorize all your notes what you do
instead<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.850> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.240> learn<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
instead is you kind of just learn the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
instead is you kind of just learn the
system<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.320> how<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> notes<00:00:26.039> actually<00:00:26.220> work<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
system of how the notes actually work so

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
system of how the notes actually work so
that<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> time<00:00:28.050> comes<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.949> figure

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that when the time comes you can figure

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.330 
that when the time comes you can figure
out<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.029> specific<00:00:30.720> note<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.500> where<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
out what a specific note is or where a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.910 
out what a specific note is or where a
specific<00:00:33.120> note<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.290> by<00:00:34.440> me<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
specific note is so here by me I have a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.590 
specific note is so here by me I have a
big<00:00:35.070> mess<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.489> stuff<00:00:35.760> written<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> board

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
big mess of stuff written on the board

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
big mess of stuff written on the board
and<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> lot<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> guys<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.860> gonna

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and I know a lot of you guys are gonna

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.990 
and I know a lot of you guys are gonna
be<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.760> bad

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
be going like it is really not that bad

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
be going like it is really not that bad
so<00:00:42.420> basically<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so basically all we got to do is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.220 
so basically all we got to do is
memorize<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.090> sequence<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.690> how<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> notes

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
memorize the sequence of how the notes

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
memorize the sequence of how the notes
come<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.610> directly

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
come about and we can just directly

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420 
come about and we can just directly
apply<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.350> guitar<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> top

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
apply that to a guitar so at the top

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
apply that to a guitar so at the top
here<00:00:50.610> i<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.030> sequence<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> notes

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
here i have the sequence of notes

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
here i have the sequence of notes
written<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.520> my

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
written out you can see I just have my

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240 
written out you can see I just have my
letters<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.329> notes<00:00:54.570> A<00:00:54.780> through<00:00:55.230> G<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.829> between

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
letters or notes A through G in between

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420 
letters or notes A through G in between
each<00:00:56.489> letter<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.270> note<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.500> sharp<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
each letter or note I have a sharp so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
each letter or note I have a sharp so
the<00:00:59.579> sharps<00:00:59.910> represent<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> threat<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.320> like

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the sharps represent a threat just like

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.000 
the sharps represent a threat just like
any<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.219> letter<00:01:03.210> represents<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> friend<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
any other letter represents a friend the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.240 
any other letter represents a friend the
a<00:01:05.040> sharp<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.570> any<00:01:06.930> less<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.560> note<00:01:07.799> than

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a sharp is not any less of a note than

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
a sharp is not any less of a note than
the<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.760> itself<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> things<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the a itself so one of the things that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
the a itself so one of the things that
you<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> understand<00:01:11.070> real<00:01:11.250> well<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you go to understand real well is that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.499 
you go to understand real well is that
when<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> show<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.369> call<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.240> flat

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
when I have a show I can call it a flat

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.990 
when I have a show I can call it a flat
so<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.470> an<00:01:16.590> HR<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.700> call<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so when I have an HR I can call it a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
so when I have an HR I can call it a
b-flat<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.380> our<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> sharp<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
b-flat so this is our a sharp the a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
b-flat so this is our a sharp the a
sharp<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.119> means<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> note<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
sharp just means it's the note that's a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
sharp just means it's the note that's a
little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.799> higher<00:01:23.009> than<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> B

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
little bit higher than the a and the B

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
little bit higher than the a and the B
flat<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.950> means<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> note<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
flat just means it's the note that's a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
flat just means it's the note that's a
little<00:01:27.330> bit<00:01:27.450> lower<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> B<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
little bit lower than the B so this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
little bit lower than the B so this
could<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.960> beef<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.860> on

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
could also be the beef lot I just on

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
could also be the beef lot I just on
this<00:01:32.250> diagram<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.329> wrote<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> sharps

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this diagram I just wrote the sharps

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.130 
this diagram I just wrote the sharps
just<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> save<00:01:35.280> space<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.990> have

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
just to save space so here I just have

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.749 
just to save space so here I just have
written<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.950> sharp<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.400> equal<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> B

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
written down like a sharp is equal to B

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
written down like a sharp is equal to B
flat<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.869> sheriff<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.259> equal<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.530> D

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
flat you know see sheriff is equal to D

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
flat you know see sheriff is equal to D
flat<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.000> forth<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
flat and so on and so forth but you can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
flat and so on and so forth but you can
see<00:01:42.990> from<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> sequence<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> sharp<00:01:44.460> or

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
see from the sequence we have a sharp or

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.350 
see from the sequence we have a sharp or
a<00:01:44.700> flat<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.600> between<00:01:46.079> every<00:01:46.500> two<00:01:46.799> notes<00:01:47.360> except

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a flat in between every two notes except

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.550 
a flat in between every two notes except
for<00:01:48.450> between<00:01:49.290> B<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.799> C<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.479> E<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.899> F<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
for between B and C and E and F so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.690 
for between B and C and E and F so
that's<00:01:52.770> definitely<00:01:52.950> something<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.399> need<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's definitely something you need to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249 
that's definitely something you need to
remember<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> only<00:01:54.720> thing

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
remember that's really the only thing

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.770 
remember that's really the only thing
that<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.250> need<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> remember<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.969> bc

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that you really need to remember is bc

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990 
that you really need to remember is bc
and<00:01:57.990> EF<00:01:58.380> there's<00:01:58.649> no<00:01:58.860> sharp<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.399> flat<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and EF there's no sharp or flat you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
and EF there's no sharp or flat you
don't<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> B<00:02:00.750> sharp<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> C<00:02:01.590> flat<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
don't have a B sharp or a C flat so you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
don't have a B sharp or a C flat so you
can<00:02:02.490> remember<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.600> closed<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.369> extra

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
can remember like be closed or extra

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
can remember like be closed or extra
friendly<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.479> taught<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
friendly this is what I was taught so

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.540 
friendly this is what I was taught so
over<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.500> made<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> table<00:02:08.280> we're<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
over here I just made a table we're in a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.279 
over here I just made a table we're in a
filling<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.119> basically<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
filling out it's just basically the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
filling out it's just basically the
notes<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> guitar<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> only<00:02:12.239> have

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
notes on the guitar so here I only have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.680 
notes on the guitar so here I only have
four

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
four

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.810 
four
bring<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.770> through<00:02:14.010> seven<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.640> have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
bring one two through seven and I have

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.060 
bring one two through seven and I have
the<00:02:14.940> strengths<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:16.980> our

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
the strengths here so we have in our

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.340 
the strengths here so we have in our
eadgbe<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.630> gonna<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.840> our<00:02:18.870> thickest

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
eadgbe so this is gonna be our thickest

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.960 
eadgbe so this is gonna be our thickest
you<00:02:19.710> know<00:02:19.800> we're<00:02:19.980> gradually<00:02:20.310> getting<00:02:20.640> thinner

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you know we're gradually getting thinner

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.030 
you know we're gradually getting thinner
as<00:02:21.210> we<00:02:21.330> go<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.480> similar<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.380> top<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> room

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
as we go up similar to how top is room

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.380 
as we go up similar to how top is room
so<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:23.910> say<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
so if you want you can just say that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.770 
so if you want you can just say that
this<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.780> fred<00:02:25.470> zero<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.370> open<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.600> we're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
this is fred zero it's open so now we're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
this is fred zero it's open so now we're
going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> apply<00:02:28.230> our<00:02:28.860> sequence<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.730> our

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
going to apply our sequence to our

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300 
going to apply our sequence to our
fretboard<00:02:30.990> well<00:02:31.260> let's<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.620> focus<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
fretboard well let's just focus on the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.310 
fretboard well let's just focus on the
thickest<00:02:32.640> string<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.090> low<00:02:33.240> E<00:02:33.420> string<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
thickest string the low E string the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.000 
thickest string the low E string the
open<00:02:34.680> note<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.370> an<00:02:35.880> e<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.050> means<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
open note is an e so that means that the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
open note is an e so that means that the
first<00:02:38.250> fret<00:02:38.520> if<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.270> keep<00:02:39.510> going<00:02:39.570> moving

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
first fret if we just keep going moving

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.490 
first fret if we just keep going moving
along<00:02:40.350> down<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.820> sequence<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.960> first<00:02:43.200> fret

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
along down this sequence the first fret

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.400 
along down this sequence the first fret
is<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> be<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> F<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.140> note

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
is going to be the F right so this note

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
is going to be the F right so this note
here<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.390> F<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.790> we're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
here is going to be an F so all we're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.820 
here is going to be an F so all we're
doing<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.960> down<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.260> sequence

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
doing is just going down the sequence

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.890 
doing is just going down the sequence
and<00:02:53.010> when<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.370> finish<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.330> go<00:02:54.660> back<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and when we finish we just go back to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.360 
and when we finish we just go back to
begin<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.650> remember<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.980> beginning<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.340> told

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
begin so remember the beginning I told

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430 
begin so remember the beginning I told
you<00:02:56.670> f<00:02:56.820> sharp<00:02:56.880> that's<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:58.050> much<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
you f sharp that's just as much of a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.430 
you f sharp that's just as much of a
note<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> F<00:02:59.340> itself<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.600> means<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
note as the F itself so that means that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.860 
note as the F itself so that means that
the<00:03:01.740> F<00:03:01.860> sharp<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.280> next<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> sequence<00:03:03.120> so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the F sharp is next in the sequence so

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
the F sharp is next in the sequence so
the<00:03:04.200> F<00:03:04.350> sharp<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.890> going<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.820> second

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the F sharp is going to be the second

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.520 
the F sharp is going to be the second
front<00:03:06.300> I'm<00:03:06.600> just<00:03:06.750> going<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.900> leave<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> blue<00:03:07.320> dot

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
front I'm just going to leave a blue dot

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170 
front I'm just going to leave a blue dot
when<00:03:07.800> there's<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.070> sharp<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.550> flat<00:03:08.580> just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
when there's a sharp or a flat just

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.640 
when there's a sharp or a flat just
because<00:03:09.480> I'm<00:03:09.660> afraid<00:03:09.960> we'll<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.350> get<00:03:10.470> too

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because I'm afraid we'll just get too

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.800 
because I'm afraid we'll just get too
messy<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.310> actually<00:03:11.460> write<00:03:11.910> every<00:03:12.510> single

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
messy if I actually write every single

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.090 
messy if I actually write every single
thing<00:03:12.840> duck<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.470> course<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> will<00:03:13.950> be

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
thing duck but of course this will be

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.310 
thing duck but of course this will be
our<00:03:14.190> F<00:03:14.340> sharp<00:03:14.550> which<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.180> also<00:03:15.360> call<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
our F sharp which you can also call the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.440 
our F sharp which you can also call the
G<00:03:16.709> flat<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.489> continue<00:03:17.910> moving<00:03:18.060> down<00:03:18.330> with

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
G flat so we continue moving down with

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.750 
G flat so we continue moving down with
sequins<00:03:18.810> we<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> G<00:03:19.830> right<00:03:20.340> so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
sequins we just get to the G right so

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.400 
sequins we just get to the G right so
the<00:03:20.910> 3rd<00:03:21.060> fret<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.570> low<00:03:21.660> E<00:03:21.810> string<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
the 3rd fret of the low E string is a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.560 
the 3rd fret of the low E string is a
Jeep<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.580> our<00:03:23.730> G<00:03:23.910> sharp<00:03:25.670> or<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:27.090> flat

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
Jeep that we have our G sharp or a flat

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.440 
Jeep that we have our G sharp or a flat
and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.440> our<00:03:28.590> sequence<00:03:29.010> restarts<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.820> we're

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
and then our sequence restarts and we're

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.390 
and then our sequence restarts and we're
back<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.130> going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> be

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
back to the a so the a is going to be

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.370 
back to the a so the a is going to be
the<00:03:32.489> 5th<00:03:32.700> fret<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.120> low<00:03:33.180> E<00:03:33.360> string<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
the 5th fret of the low E string in this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.110 
the 5th fret of the low E string in this
a<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.190> 5th<00:03:35.400> fret<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> low<00:03:35.820> E<00:03:35.970> string

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
a on the 5th fret of the low E string

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.990 
a on the 5th fret of the low E string
that's<00:03:36.690> also<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.110> exact<00:03:37.440> same<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.890> as<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.820> one

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
that's also the exact same a as the one

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.210 
that's also the exact same a as the one
that's<00:03:39.239> open<00:03:39.420> on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> string<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> notes

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that's open on the a string so the notes

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.740 
that's open on the a string so the notes
that<00:03:41.400> follow<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.420> low<00:03:42.570> E<00:03:42.600> string

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
that follow this a on the low E string

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.660 
that follow this a on the low E string
or<00:03:43.140> going<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.320> be<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> same<00:03:43.680> notes<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.489> come

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
or going to be the same notes that come

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.670 
or going to be the same notes that come
after<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> string<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.560> have

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
after this a on the a string so we have

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.800 
after this a on the a string so we have
a<00:03:46.709> sharp<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.850> 6th<00:03:48.120> fret<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> low<00:03:48.540> E

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
a sharp on the 6th fret of the low E

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.229 
a sharp on the 6th fret of the low E
string<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:49.260> well<00:03:49.800> as<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.489> first<00:03:50.760> fret<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
string as well as on the first fret of

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.449 
string as well as on the first fret of
the<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.110> string<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.769> what<00:03:53.010> comes<00:03:53.160> after<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
the a string and what comes after a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.210 
the a string and what comes after a
sharp<00:03:53.820> well<00:03:54.300> be<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.410> we<00:03:55.590> remove<00:03:55.860> there's<00:03:56.070> no

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
sharp well be and we remove there's no

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.330 
sharp well be and we remove there's no
sharp<00:03:56.550> or<00:03:56.820> flat<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.390> between<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.110> B<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> C<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
sharp or flat in between the B and C you

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.220 
sharp or flat in between the B and C you
just<00:03:59.580> have<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.820> be<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.570> then<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> have<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.959> see

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
just have to be and then you have to see

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.479 
just have to be and then you have to see
so<00:04:01.500> that's<00:04:01.650> why<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.800> 3rd<00:04:02.040> fret<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
so that's why the 3rd fret of the a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.360 
so that's why the 3rd fret of the a
string<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> seat<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.350> remember<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.890> low<00:04:05.340> E

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
string is a seat so remember this low E

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.070 
string is a seat so remember this low E
string<00:04:05.519> obviously<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.540> going<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> same

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
string obviously is going to be the same

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.190 
string obviously is going to be the same
notes<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.820> high<00:04:08.970> E<00:04:09.209> string<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.900> I'll

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
notes as up on the high E string so I'll

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.620 
notes as up on the high E string so I'll
just<00:04:10.230> fill<00:04:10.709> out<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:11.280> rope<00:04:11.580> too<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.480> like

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
this a is the same as this a this D is

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.680 
this a is the same as this a this D is
going<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.500> be<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> same<00:04:16.980> as<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.790> D<00:04:18.030> remember

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
going to be the same as this D remember

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
going to be the same as this D remember
there's<00:04:18.900> no<00:04:19.049> sharp<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.739> flat<00:04:19.769> between<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.789> E

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
there's no sharp or flat between the E

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.469 
there's no sharp or flat between the E
and<00:04:21.419> F<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.320> right<00:04:22.800> after<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.160> e<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.850> have<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.390> F

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
and F so right after the e we have the F

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.000 
and F so right after the e we have the F
so<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.080> hope<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.320> guys<00:04:25.350> pretty<00:04:25.590> much

for<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.710> guys<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.220> my<00:04:38.430> finished<00:04:38.960> table

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
for it so guys this is my finished table

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.570 
for it so guys this is my finished table
it's<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.410> little<00:04:40.590> bit<00:04:40.710> messier<00:04:41.130> than<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.340> thought

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
it's a little bit messier than I thought

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.130 
it's a little bit messier than I thought
it<00:04:41.640> would<00:04:41.760> be<00:04:41.910> there's<00:04:42.270> kind<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.570> there<00:04:42.990> may<00:04:43.110> be

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
it would be there's kind of there may be

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.200 
it would be there's kind of there may be
some<00:04:43.380> confusion<00:04:43.590> with<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.120> alignment<00:04:45.120> of
