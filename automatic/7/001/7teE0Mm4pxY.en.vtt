00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:26.570
 it's a different technique using yes 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.830
 you heard right let's encapsulate today 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 tapes the tape that can be used 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 for hair tape for the two ribbons 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.950
 for crafts the colors of the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 ribbon how to use today are turquoise and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 fuchsia and they will go over a layer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.770
 fine finite acrylic color that are 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 these I'm going to use look good 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 dark but they will not stay has been 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 you will see because you can use 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
 yellow is already prepared with the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 frost and this that looks like a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.969
 Salmon naranja dito if you could say 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.460
 well and it also has frost 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 inside they come prepared like this from the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 mark and encrypted if you want to know which 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320
 are the names you are looking for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 in the part of the description of the video 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 and I'll write it down there 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.580
 as you can see I already have my one 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.720
 ready I have the tip prepare first 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.229
 nail the first provider placed on 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.229
 bondi and I will extend my natural base 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.550
 with this color that 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.670
 darker because what I want is that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.810
 that natural line is covered by me 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 I have and extend it a little bit more 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 you can use any color your dc not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.049
 necessarily have to do this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.049
 technique they have the inverted 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 and you can also use a color that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.220
 be one or two darker shades of your 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.990
 skin or mine is like a color 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.920
 in brown tones 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.840
 they also come as in pink tones you 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.850
 you decide which one you want to use now 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 with the very finite layer of these both 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 colors are not going to be that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 striking as you can see in the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 result result final forgiveness as 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.160
 a sample that shows you at the beginning 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.890
 What I want is for these to mix 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.319
 two colors and now I'm going to place this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 pearl well wet as you can see it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.380
 here 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.250
 because I do not want that yellow me 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.560
 are there are lighters there I go to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.580
 use this shine they sell it in 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.070
 Paris 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 and it's skin or for the face of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.260
 makeup 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.230
 you can use it on the nail, that's why it was 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.730
 that apply my 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.040
 pearl well wet so that this shine 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.720
 take off now what they could see 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.870
 was that I put a drop of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.510
 of nail sticks use the one you 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.920
 want 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.189
 and start to stick your tape and for now 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.930
 you're going to hit nothing else in the middle and 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.730
 you're just going to do yourself tries to 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.019
 maneuver here as you can as 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.019
 You can see what I'm doing 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.880
 let the ribbon strokes remain 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.350
 little bit longer because you can 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.960
 manipulate them 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.280
 take it wherever you want her to 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.830
 stick 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.190
 with what is another stick of another droplet 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.050
 of sticks on top of the pink ribbon and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.319
 now how can you see here my first 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.660
 pink ribbon fuyÃ  I pasted it first 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.730
 true and with blue and now I'm going with the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.709
 yours again and I want me to stay by 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.200
 above the blue since the first one 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.790
 I placed was below and the other case 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 what you can do is paste them well 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.310
 Together as I just showed you 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.330
 I'm going to place the paste droplet 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.360
 you do not want to hit everything where a cantazo 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.239
 because if you make an error, it's more 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.459
 easy to lift it if they have a droplet not 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.950
 that is completely attached to the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.620
 Fingernail can also paste this with 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.560
 transparent acrylic but it's going to 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.360
 take a little longer to dry so 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.600
 in this way you can manipulate them 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.459
 a little more 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.160
 I 'm not going with the next color, which is 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.950
 turquoise if you have a longer because 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.840
 you can use more tapes you can 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.670
 exchange the colors 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.950
 you necessarily have to use the 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:37.170
 same or repeat the same color 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.170
 I'm going with another drop of glue 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.670
 yes the 1st 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.890
 trace of blue that you say goes over 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.660
 of the first pink means that the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.120
 second it's like you 're doing 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.510
 a basket the second one will go by 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.740
 under the first pink and above 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.740
 of the second pink 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.430
 the ribbons will be left over like this for the 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.590
 sides do not worry because it 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.029
 you have to paste these tapes 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.029
 completely to your nails 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.320
 and also what you get for the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.850
 edges make sure to always stick on the 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.960
 shore well because if you're not going to 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.360
 lift and you will notice that they have 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.690
 a tape and the hairs to be 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.690
 come out 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.050
 they will proceed to cut them and remember 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.720
 paste them well that they are well sealed to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.690
 the sides 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.820
 try that all are enough 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.820
 stuck and that they last they do not matter 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.070
 that is wet because it is not going to notice 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.230
 proceeds to apply transparent acrylic 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.960
 above all the nails you will file 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.540
 you're going to polish how normally you put a 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.990
 nail and you use a top coat of your 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:09.450
 preference and this is the product of the 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.520
 colors that you of 6 and subscribe to the
