from now they will disappear again it's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.299 
from now they will disappear again it's
peacetime<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.650> can't<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.250> much

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
peacetime now so we can't really do much

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
peacetime now so we can't really do much
but<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.360> tell<00:00:33.420> by<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> bloodstains

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
but as you can tell by the bloodstains

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.549 
but as you can tell by the bloodstains
we<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.770> been<00:00:34.920> killing<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.399> before<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
we have been killing them before so you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.970 
we have been killing them before so you
can<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.190> kill<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.670> using<00:00:38.969> AoE<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
can actually kill them using AoE and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.510 
can actually kill them using AoE and
then<00:00:42.590> well<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.920> steal<00:00:44.100> their<00:00:44.280> packs

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
then well you can steal their packs

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.049 
then well you can steal their packs
basically<00:00:46.039> we're<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.219> guys<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> forums

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
basically we're some guys in the forums

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
basically we're some guys in the forums
claiming<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> bug<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
claiming that this was a bug and not a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.720 
claiming that this was a bug and not a
hack<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:52.879> i<00:00:53.879> think<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.870> video<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.440> show

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
hack but i think this video will show

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.979 
hack but i think this video will show
differently<00:00:56.730> there's<00:00:57.059> still<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.449> guy<00:00:57.629> inside

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
differently there's still one guy inside

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.920 
differently there's still one guy inside
here<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.800> will<00:00:58.920> teleport<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.930> in

will be teleporting out again and the
rate<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.700> bots<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.150> coming<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
rate at which the bots are coming is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
rate at which the bots are coming is
quite<00:01:24.990> high<00:01:25.460> even<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> kill<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.150> them

so yeah new guy just teleported in home
team<00:01:38.760> yet<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.330> he's<00:01:39.450> standing<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.930> top<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
team yet because he's standing on top of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 
team yet because he's standing on top of
the<00:01:40.350> other<00:01:40.410> part<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.160> they're<00:01:41.970> pretty

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the other part so they're pretty

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.970 
the other part so they're pretty
difficult<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.020> detect<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
difficult to detect but there's the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.120 
difficult to detect but there's the
second<00:01:44.310> trade<00:01:44.460> pact<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.480> top<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
second trade pact right there on top and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
second trade pact right there on top and
then<00:01:47.130> they'll<00:01:47.460> teleport<00:01:47.910> out<00:01:47.970> shortly<00:01:48.300> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
then they'll teleport out shortly and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.130 
then they'll teleport out shortly and
this<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.050> going<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.850> 24-7<00:01:50.850> without<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.870> single

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this is going on 24-7 without a single

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.250 
this is going on 24-7 without a single
interruption<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:52.950> am<00:01:53.790> assuming<00:01:54.260> either

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
interruption I am assuming either

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.050 
interruption I am assuming either
they're<00:01:55.590> buying<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.220> materials<00:01:56.370> because

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
they're buying the materials because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.520 
they're buying the materials because
they<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.300> still<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.780> profit<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
they will still get a profit out of it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.010 
they will still get a profit out of it
or<00:01:59.120> that<00:02:00.120> they<00:02:00.300> have<00:02:00.540> BOTS<00:02:01.080> set<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
or that they have BOTS set up to do the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.950 
or that they have BOTS set up to do the
actual<00:02:04.020> farming<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.830> well<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.690> major

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
actual farming as well but it is a major

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.560 
actual farming as well but it is a major
issue<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.640> economy<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> game<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
issue for the economy of the game this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.420 
issue for the economy of the game this
is<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.080> trade<00:02:10.350> station<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.950> one

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
is just one trade station or one

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.510 
is just one trade station or one
