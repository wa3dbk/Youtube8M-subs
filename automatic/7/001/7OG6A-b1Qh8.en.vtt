00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
this house we've been spotted by some of

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.150 
this house we've been spotted by some of
the<00:03:52.820> infected<00:03:53.270> on<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> outside<00:03:53.980> I'm<00:03:54.980> gonna

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
the infected on the outside I'm gonna

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.220 
the infected on the outside I'm gonna
tell<00:03:55.370> sheva<00:03:55.670> actually<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.390> do<00:03:56.720> some<00:03:56.900> work<00:03:56.930> for

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
tell sheva actually to do some work for

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.770 
tell sheva actually to do some work for
a<00:03:57.290> change<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.490> real<00:03:59.030> quickly<00:03:59.300> gave<00:03:59.600> her

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
a change so I just real quickly gave her

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.580 
a change so I just real quickly gave her
an<00:03:59.900> order<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.770> move<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.700> over<00:04:02.350> yeah<00:04:03.350> it's

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
an order to move that over yeah it's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.350 
an order to move that over yeah it's
really<00:04:03.830> cool<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.280> way<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.520> works<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.000> you

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
really cool the way it works so you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120 
really cool the way it works so you
actually<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:06.470> know<00:04:06.590> you're<00:04:06.770> simulating

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
actually you know you're simulating

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.090 
actually you know you're simulating
co-op<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.030> get<00:04:08.270> a<00:04:08.300> buddy<00:04:08.480> as<00:04:08.690> well<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.320> lots<00:04:09.980> of

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
co-op and get a buddy as well so lots of

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.230 
co-op and get a buddy as well so lots of
cool<00:04:10.220> things<00:04:10.400> happening<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.970> game<00:04:11.120> you

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
cool things happening in the game you

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.940 
cool things happening in the game you
see<00:04:11.360> we<00:04:11.450> got<00:04:11.480> lots<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.840> real-time<00:04:12.020> physics<00:04:12.650> and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
see we got lots of real-time physics and

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.400 
see we got lots of real-time physics and
real<00:04:13.760> particles<00:04:14.330> shoot<00:04:14.780> some<00:04:14.960> grapefruits

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
real particles shoot some grapefruits

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.810 
real particles shoot some grapefruits
here<00:04:15.620> I<00:04:15.770> know<00:04:16.160> look<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.549> shoot<00:04:16.670> a<00:04:16.700> few

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
here I know look just shoot a few

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.699 
here I know look just shoot a few
grapefruits<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.540> guess<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.110> one<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.530> more

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
grapefruits I guess a one of the more

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.260 
grapefruits I guess a one of the more
impressive<00:04:19.130> things<00:04:19.549> that<00:04:19.670> I<00:04:19.730> enjoys<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.150> fact

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
impressive things that I enjoys the fact

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.900 
impressive things that I enjoys the fact
that<00:04:20.390> she<00:04:20.480> does<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:20.989> get<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:21.860> your<00:04:22.010> way<00:04:22.220> no<00:04:22.670> she

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
that she does not get in your way no she

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.400 
that she does not get in your way no she
does<00:04:23.150> good<00:04:23.330> she<00:04:23.510> does<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:23.810> just<00:04:24.080> stand<00:04:24.260> there

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
does good she does not just stand there

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.320 
does good she does not just stand there
she's<00:04:24.830> really<00:04:25.070> clever<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.580> if<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:26.150> listen

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
she's really clever and if you listen

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.450 
she's really clever and if you listen
she's<00:04:26.780> always<00:04:27.200> active<00:04:27.680> behind<00:04:28.100> her<00:04:28.220> she's

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
she's always active behind her she's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.730 
she's always active behind her she's
running<00:04:28.730> around<00:04:28.820> she's<00:04:29.540> grabbing<00:04:29.840> ammo<00:04:30.320> she's

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
running around she's grabbing ammo she's

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.410 
running around she's grabbing ammo she's
moving<00:04:31.040> things<00:04:31.220> around<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.790> she's<00:04:32.300> gonna

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
moving things around and she's gonna

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.850 
moving things around and she's gonna
start<00:04:32.720> taking<00:04:33.080> fire<00:04:33.260> at<00:04:33.440> some<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.740> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
start taking fire at some of the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.080 
start taking fire at some of the
infected<00:04:34.160> as<00:04:34.430> they're<00:04:34.610> coming<00:04:34.730> through<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
infected as they're coming through the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.600 
infected as they're coming through the
window<00:04:35.360> they're<00:04:35.510> here<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:37.010> see<00:04:37.280> she<00:04:37.580> just

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
window they're here you see she just

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.490 
window they're here you see she just
roundhouse<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.570> guy<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.900> face<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.260> hard<00:04:39.380> I

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
roundhouse that guy that face so hard I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.060 
roundhouse that guy that face so hard I
fell<00:04:39.530> backwards<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:40.160> growth<00:04:40.370> table<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.680> lot

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
fell backwards in growth table so a lot

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.920 
fell backwards in growth table so a lot
of<00:04:43.100> interactive<00:04:43.700> environment<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.870> the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
of interactive environment one of the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.320 
of interactive environment one of the
really<00:04:45.050> cool<00:04:45.170> things<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.790> don't

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
really cool things that I like I don't

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.680 
really cool things that I like I don't
like<00:04:47.570> surprises<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:48.790> most<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:49.970> doors<00:04:50.270> here

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
like surprises so most of the doors here

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.250 
like surprises so most of the doors here
are<00:04:51.590> destructible
