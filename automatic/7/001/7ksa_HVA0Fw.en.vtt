00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.110 

okay<00:00:07.640> we<00:00:07.850> took<00:00:08.000> a<00:00:08.149> look<00:00:08.300> at<00:00:08.980> wording<00:00:09.980> off<00:00:10.160> using

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
okay we took a look at wording off using

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.490 
okay we took a look at wording off using
the<00:00:11.240> hinge<00:00:11.480> on<00:00:11.750> the<00:00:12.320> ward<00:00:13.010> off<00:00:13.219> and<00:00:14.440> now<00:00:15.440> we

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the hinge on the ward off and now we

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.260 
the hinge on the ward off and now we
want<00:00:15.709> to<00:00:15.860> cover<00:00:16.010> one<00:00:16.309> other<00:00:16.490> important<00:00:17.029> point

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
want to cover one other important point

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.540 
want to cover one other important point
well<00:00:17.869> not<00:00:18.020> just<00:00:18.080> using<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.650> hinge<00:00:18.890> but<00:00:19.430> in

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
well not just using the hinge but in

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.400 
well not just using the hinge but in
terms<00:00:19.580> of<00:00:19.940> proper<00:00:20.500> distancing<00:00:21.699> if<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:22.849> notice

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
terms of proper distancing if you notice

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.230 
terms of proper distancing if you notice
I'm<00:00:24.410> using<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.890> hands<00:00:25.130> letting<00:00:25.519> my<00:00:25.669> shoulder

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
I'm using a hands letting my shoulder

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.349 
I'm using a hands letting my shoulder
swing<00:00:26.480> freely<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.320> utilizing<00:00:28.249> my<00:00:28.429> my<00:00:28.999> entire

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
swing freely and utilizing my my entire

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.280 
swing freely and utilizing my my entire
body<00:00:29.749> to<00:00:30.169> do<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:30.589> coming<00:00:31.310> coming<00:00:31.640> here<00:00:32.140> but<00:00:33.140> if

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
body to do so coming coming here but if

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.350 
body to do so coming coming here but if
we're<00:00:33.440> making<00:00:33.740> a<00:00:33.860> circle<00:00:34.130> coming<00:00:35.030> here<00:00:35.239> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
we're making a circle coming here and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.670 
we're making a circle coming here and
maintaining<00:00:36.050> an<00:00:36.170> l-shape<00:00:37.150> baby<00:00:38.410> we<00:00:39.410> can't

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
maintaining an l-shape baby we can't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.400 
maintaining an l-shape baby we can't
reach<00:00:39.950> them<00:00:40.160> with<00:00:40.220> this<00:00:40.550> circle<00:00:41.030> okay<00:00:41.660> do<00:00:42.230> we

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
reach them with this circle okay do we

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.860 
reach them with this circle okay do we
reach<00:00:42.770> for<00:00:43.100> him<00:00:43.280> no<00:00:43.970> because<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:44.510> take<00:00:44.720> our

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
reach for him no because we take our

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.410 
reach for him no because we take our
self<00:00:45.140> out<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.590> our<00:00:45.740> element<00:00:45.950> our<00:00:46.850> physics<00:00:47.300> is

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
self out of our element our physics is

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.540 
self out of our element our physics is
broken<00:00:47.870> we're<00:00:48.290> overextended<00:00:48.680> for

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
broken we're overextended for

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.640 
broken we're overextended for
off-balance<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.450> we<00:00:50.780> can't<00:00:51.020> get<00:00:51.170> any<00:00:51.380> power

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
off-balance and we can't get any power

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.740 
off-balance and we can't get any power
that<00:00:51.980> way<00:00:52.190> because<00:00:52.460> we<00:00:52.790> separate<00:00:53.390> our<00:00:53.540> arm

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
that way because we separate our arm

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.980 
that way because we separate our arm
from<00:00:54.350> its<00:00:54.380> power<00:00:54.710> source<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.210> idea<00:00:56.360> is<00:00:56.660> to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
from its power source so the idea is to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.430 
from its power source so the idea is to
move<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.590> entire<00:00:58.250> power<00:00:59.120> source<00:00:59.510> closer

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
move the entire power source closer

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.650 
move the entire power source closer
which<00:01:01.160> is<00:01:01.190> why<00:01:01.430> I'm<00:01:01.610> Tai<00:01:01.790> Chi<00:01:02.060> they<00:01:02.180> say<00:01:02.390> don't

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
which is why I'm Tai Chi they say don't

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.219 
which is why I'm Tai Chi they say don't
extend<00:01:03.020> over<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.530> knee<00:01:03.680> dr<00:01:04.220> front<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.990> we

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
extend over the knee dr front here so we

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.760 
extend over the knee dr front here so we
just<00:01:06.470> step<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:08.180> remember<00:01:09.049> our<00:01:09.439> feet

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
just step in because remember our feet

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.429 
just step in because remember our feet
are<00:01:10.009> not<00:01:10.159> nailed<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:10.759> floor<00:01:10.789> so<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.899> make

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
are not nailed to the floor so we make

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.940 
are not nailed to the floor so we make
ourselves<00:01:12.590> mobile<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.320> that's<00:01:15.320> why<00:01:15.469> we<00:01:15.499> step

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
ourselves mobile so that's why we step

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
ourselves mobile so that's why we step
in<00:01:16.159> shift<00:01:16.700> our<00:01:16.880> weight<00:01:17.170> coming<00:01:18.170> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
in shift our weight coming here

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.460 
in shift our weight coming here
and<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.320> relax<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.220> same<00:01:20.460> thing<00:01:21.470> striking

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and just relax the same thing striking

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.520 
and just relax the same thing striking
here<00:01:22.830> weathers<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.820> body<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:28.140> doesn't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
here weathers for the body it doesn't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.820 
here weathers for the body it doesn't
matter<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.490> can't<00:01:29.790> reach<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.750> come<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.229> we

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
matter we can't reach don't come here we

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.850 
matter we can't reach don't come here we
wore<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.370> we<00:01:32.700> come<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.210> war<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.290> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
wore it off we come in war it off we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
wore it off we come in war it off we
come<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.520> constantly<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.869> our

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
come in we constantly want to use our

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
come in we constantly want to use our
movement<00:01:37.619> also<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.790> coming<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.270> we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
movement also by coming there we

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
movement also by coming there we
generate<00:01:40.020> even<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.320> force<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
generate even more force so not just the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.840 
generate even more force so not just the
