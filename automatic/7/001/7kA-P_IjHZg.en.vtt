hi YouTube Darth here this week we had
quite<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> few<00:00:02.460> changes<00:00:02.639> on<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.060> battlefield

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
quite a few changes on the battlefield

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.390 
quite a few changes on the battlefield
for<00:00:03.720> community<00:00:04.140> test<00:00:04.319> environment<00:00:04.470> but<00:00:05.220> there

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
for community test environment but there

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920 
for community test environment but there
was<00:00:05.580> one<00:00:05.609> change<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.180> didn't<00:00:06.509> quite<00:00:06.600> make<00:00:06.870> it

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
was one change that didn't quite make it

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.330 
was one change that didn't quite make it
that<00:00:07.200> I'll<00:00:07.319> talk<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.560> anyways<00:00:08.130> because

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
that I'll talk about anyways because

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.890 
that I'll talk about anyways because
Teague<00:00:08.730> was<00:00:08.880> gracious<00:00:09.240> enough<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.510> give<00:00:09.630> us

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
Teague was gracious enough to give us

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.690 
Teague was gracious enough to give us
some<00:00:10.080> preview<00:00:10.410> screen<00:00:10.679> shots<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.429> I'll<00:00:11.550> talk

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
some preview screen shots but I'll talk

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.370 
some preview screen shots but I'll talk
about<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.269> more<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.840> week's<00:00:12.990> CTE

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
about all that more in this week's CTE

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
about all that more in this week's CTE
Sunday<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.920> let's<00:00:14.340> get<00:00:14.519> started<00:00:14.940> in

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
Sunday so let's get started in

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.849 
Sunday so let's get started in
preparation<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> upcoming<00:00:16.139> nine<00:00:16.650> maps

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
preparation for the upcoming nine maps

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.620 
preparation for the upcoming nine maps
dices<00:00:17.279> removed<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> visual<00:00:18.000> recoil<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
dices removed the visual recoil from the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.170 
dices removed the visual recoil from the
irnv<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.590> Fleur<00:00:20.010> optics<00:00:20.609> if<00:00:20.880> you're<00:00:21.060> not

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
irnv and Fleur optics if you're not

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.759 
irnv and Fleur optics if you're not
familiar<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.660> visual<00:00:21.960> recoil<00:00:22.260> that's<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
familiar with visual recoil that's the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.349 
familiar with visual recoil that's the
added<00:00:23.039> animation<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.640> optics<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
added animation on optics where the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.730 
added animation on optics where the
scope<00:00:24.600> would<00:00:24.779> bounce<00:00:24.990> around<00:00:25.320> independently

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
scope would bounce around independently

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
scope would bounce around independently
of<00:00:26.279> where<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> barrel<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.150> actually

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
of where the barrel was actually

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
of where the barrel was actually
pointing<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.590> scopes<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.010> operate

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
pointing now these scopes will operate

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
pointing now these scopes will operate
like<00:00:29.519> any<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> other<00:00:30.029> red<00:00:30.539> dot<00:00:30.750> 1x<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.619> 2x

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
like any of the other red dot 1x and 2x

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
like any of the other red dot 1x and 2x
copes<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> game<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.120> no<00:00:33.360> longer

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
copes in the game and they no longer

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
copes in the game and they no longer
have<00:00:33.930> visual<00:00:34.320> recoil<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have visual recoil well I think that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.860 
have visual recoil well I think that
people<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> continue<00:00:36.360> holding<00:00:36.750> on

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
people are going to continue holding on

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.510 
people are going to continue holding on
to<00:00:36.989> their<00:00:37.110> red<00:00:37.290> dots<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.860> might<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.100> push

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
to their red dots this might just push

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.680 
to their red dots this might just push
people<00:00:38.820> away<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> hollows<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
people away from the hollows and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
people away from the hollows and
medium-range<00:00:40.260> scopes<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> infrared<00:00:41.550> does

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
medium-range scopes as the infrared does

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
medium-range scopes as the infrared does
make<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> easier<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.600> spot<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.960> targets<00:00:43.379> from

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
make it easier to spot out targets from

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
make it easier to spot out targets from
the<00:00:43.739> surrounding<00:00:44.250> environment<00:00:44.340> dice<00:00:45.090> has

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the surrounding environment dice has

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
the surrounding environment dice has
asked<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.020> feedback<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.590> change<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.160> be

battlefield for CTE subreddit except the
scoreboard<00:00:53.879> display<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> game<00:00:54.629> saw<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
scoreboard display for the game saw a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.869 
scoreboard display for the game saw a
small<00:00:55.230> change<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:56.039> players<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.670> dead

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
small change now players that are dead

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
small change now players that are dead
will<00:00:57.059> show<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.360> darkened<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> scoreboard

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
will show up darkened in the scoreboard

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.869 
will show up darkened in the scoreboard
so<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> glance<00:00:59.129> you'll<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.520> able<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> pick

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so at a glance you'll be able to pick

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.430 
so at a glance you'll be able to pick
out<00:01:00.030> who<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.629> team<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> enemy

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
out who from your team and the enemy

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
out who from your team and the enemy
team<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.949> still<00:01:02.100> alive<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> who<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> dead<00:01:03.390> if

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
team is still alive and who is dead if

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
team is still alive and who is dead if
anybody<00:01:04.140> played<00:01:04.530> diffuse<00:01:04.920> I'd<00:01:05.129> say<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
anybody played diffuse I'd say that this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.679 
anybody played diffuse I'd say that this
would<00:01:05.790> probably<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> good<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
would probably be a good bit of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
would probably be a good bit of
information<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> game<00:01:07.830> mode<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.340> it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
information for that game mode but it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
information for that game mode but it's
still<00:01:08.700> nice<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.299> personally<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> still

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
still nice to know personally I still

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.570 
still nice to know personally I still
miss<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> day<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

the past weeks this should reduce the

the past weeks this should reduce the

momentary nuisance it seems like

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
momentary nuisance it seems like
suppression<00:01:55.079> has<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> its<00:01:55.770> teeth

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
effects kind of leaves me wondering why

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990

suppression<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.890> even<00:02:02.130> still<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> game<00:02:02.700> if

with<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> summer<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> say<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.140> this

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
with the summer I have to say that this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
with the summer I have to say that this
will<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.800> biggest<00:02:22.040> impacts<00:02:22.520> at<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
will have the biggest impacts at the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.400 
will have the biggest impacts at the
start<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.120> rounds<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:23.959> players<00:02:24.200> that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
start of the rounds and for players that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.720 
start of the rounds and for players that
are<00:02:24.500> used<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.800> spawning<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.280> immediately

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
are used to spawning and immediately

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.730 
are used to spawning and immediately
using<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.120> weapon<00:02:26.300> in<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.660> reprisal<00:02:27.050> role<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
using a weapon in a reprisal role I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.320 
using a weapon in a reprisal role I
didn't<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> opportunity<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.910> test<00:02:29.180> this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
didn't have the opportunity to test this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.240 
didn't have the opportunity to test this
out<00:02:29.510> but<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> suspect<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.380> also<00:02:30.770> fixes<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
out but I suspect this also fixes the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.949 
out but I suspect this also fixes the
commander<00:02:31.640> create<00:02:31.880> exploit<00:02:32.300> for<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.570> UCAV

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
commander create exploit for the UCAV

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.900 
commander create exploit for the UCAV
ultimately<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.950> change<00:02:34.220> seems<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> good

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
ultimately this change seems like a good

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.330 
ultimately this change seems like a good
one<00:02:35.120> even<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.780> was<00:02:36.050> missing<00:02:36.410> my<00:02:36.560> UKF<00:02:36.980> quite<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
one even if I was missing my UKF quite a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.040 
one even if I was missing my UKF quite a
bit<00:02:37.580> for<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.820> quick<00:02:38.090> helicopter<00:02:38.270> takedown

down helicopters which I still groan
about<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.510> definitely<00:02:59.720> not<00:03:00.080> as<00:03:00.290> easy<00:03:00.470> as
