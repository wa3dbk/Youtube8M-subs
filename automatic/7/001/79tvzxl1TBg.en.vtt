00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.230
 who finds some bug inside a sack of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 sugar cookie sugar 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.530
 sometimes companies are guilty or 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 another not expensive is the way you are 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 storing that product at home 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.720

 bacteria ingrid very good day how is it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 We can avoid these surprises. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
 nasty ones where william know that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 clothing employer that many 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.119
 housewives use to seal the rice 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.679
 bean package because it is according to the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 doctor bacterium that is here of my 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.690
 side can not and why can not of course 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 who can not one spoke to be sincere 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.899
 in this clothes preacher often 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 person did not blow food in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.070
 picked up the clothesline and sometimes even a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 dog fell on the floor the company has a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 then no wood or any kind of wood 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 you can use in kitchens and what 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.610
 do 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 Look, you have an amazing idea. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 You know that plastic bottle 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 that water plane you're going to play 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 off and you make you cut that part 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.090
 here is the fact that you put the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.490
 inside it, here you are, and put it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:12.299
 inside it turns the top and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 place here ready you used if not 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.100
 throw the garbage out in a game the garbage out 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 and you're going to use everything, it 's all at home. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 we always cut these parts of your 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 waited so nothing to use preachers 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 even clothing to enjoy 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.600
 to pick up all employers who 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 all here is not what we 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 do 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.049
 We play wherever she tries, I know. 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.540
 there now that it is cool is that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.250
 tomato sauce has the cream of milk that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 comes in the can also after open has 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 that we go to the refrigerator we make ourselves 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 for cans and take out everything and put 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 plastic containers or glass ifor 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.689
 this kind of long life or that kind 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.329
 you only give one double and you can save 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.320
 and can be in the refrigerator door without 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.210
 no problem 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.130
 Now doctor I'm impressed but 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.460
 What a good idea to keep 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.990
 Products Cutting A Bottle That Pet 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.479
 there we can do for example with 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.130
 that bag of meat you took 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.290
 a part of the subject and then 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.300
 another not to tie the knot to vote in the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.910
 freezer or not only in the same product 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.150
 dry it can even look if you have 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.280
 depending on the food looks 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.900
 in this bread so that what I did I 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.909
 I used a small bottle these 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.970
 I cut the windpipes 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.079
 Totally all of us here do nothing 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.299
 But let me ask a question, sir. 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.000
 generally places that wire 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.709
 Come on the bun so you can do this. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.909
 it also does not accumulate a little bit of 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.069
 dirt in the group 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.780
 not because it 's classic they are dishwasher safe 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.549
 so it can be washed without problem 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.540
 none here he was friend can also 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.829
 be used 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.079
 which can not be used in any way 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.909
 none is that the wooden preachers 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.099
 here for many times every year of 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.680
 House knows this is what the dog got 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.480
 Jaú and only a little touch neither by that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.290
 can handle it and if it does not 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.599
 right can 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.849
 another doubt william knows those pots 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.959
 let's put the pasta and the cinema 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.180
 of plastic that we put the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 This food is also correct. 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 No problem 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.950
 you can use that many times the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.170
 windlass car that guy had the clubs 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.540
 river that is going to feed is often 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.819
 your own home that stock you 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.290
 left a lot of time so people give a 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.959
 look at a lamp in your stock 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.150
 every week every week and if you have 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.190
 Do you have any bug? 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.019
 advice to burn burn it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.419
 can infect others 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.760
 take advantage of the shelf- life 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.530
 also on the island we sure look 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 Thanks for the tip I hope you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.970
 home also enjoy well
