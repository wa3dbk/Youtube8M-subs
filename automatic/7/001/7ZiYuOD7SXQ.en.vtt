00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.060
 a tribute to sticks 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.160

 that against what you think is a lot sadder old 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.120
 in this aspect that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.760
 I'm not thinking of working naturally, like water is the 14th 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 locked but can also be applied perfectly because it is in full 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 maturity in fiber 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950
 the one who charged 2 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 by the way they are the one on top of thousand 798 represents the commander by vásquez 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.670
 commander already with the English invasions and the one below 13 thousand 807 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.120
 It represents 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.740
 will have been able 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.300
 He stressed that local caricaturists are giving the news at the time he was 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.120
 fighting against the English 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.040
 they invite to the mass that the English several good airs 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.710
 josé josé yélamo people as the beginning of the sample of states of america 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.840
 North made them were representative as to place them 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 he tried to make a story 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480
 of the history of the country 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.910
 told how he managed to only see the actors at each moment

 very accurately all the political vicissitudes of that era 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.540

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.109

 more true than the story of a written testimony 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.469
 because through those of drawing and holiness 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.869
 can you believe maybe 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:34.079
 by reflecting situations that can not be reflected through the written word 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.109
