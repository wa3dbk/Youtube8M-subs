00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
now down here at the very bottom is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
now down here at the very bottom is
where<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.280> your

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
enabled toggles as well as your disabled
toggle<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> start<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.770> your

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
toggle so you start out with all of your
toggles<00:01:02.879> enabled<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> obviously

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
toggles enabled and you can obviously

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
toggles enabled and you can obviously
take<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> grabber<00:01:04.949> right<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
take the grabber right here and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
take the grabber right here and
rearrange<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.360> however<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.500> know

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
rearrange them however you want to know

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
rearrange them however you want to know
rii<00:01:08.220> spring<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> required<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.720> see

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
rii spring is required so you can see

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
rii spring is required so you can see
here<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.619> rotation<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.549> cellular<00:01:11.790> data

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
here now rotation is first cellular data

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350 
here now rotation is first cellular data
so<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> changes<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.460> exact<00:01:14.909> same<00:01:15.119> time

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so it changes in the exact same time

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
so it changes in the exact same time
that<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> change<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.369> jump<00:01:17.610> into

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that you change it so if we jump into

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
that you change it so if we jump into
the<00:01:18.000> theme<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the theme here which is actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
the theme here which is actually
probably<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> coolest<00:01:19.770> thing<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
probably the coolest thing here just

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
probably the coolest thing here just
because<00:01:20.880> we've<00:01:21.270> seen<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> toggles<00:01:22.740> on

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
because we've seen all the toggles on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.730 
because we've seen all the toggles on
the<00:01:23.250> control<00:01:24.240> center<00:01:24.479> before<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.530> look

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the control center before but if we look

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.890 
the control center before but if we look
at<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> themes<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.299> bunch<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
at the themes you have a bunch of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.260 
at the themes you have a bunch of
different<00:01:28.320> kinds<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.310> iOS<00:01:29.850> 7

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
different kinds you have three iOS 7

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.510 
different kinds you have three iOS 7
themes<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.380> filled<00:01:31.770> circle<00:01:32.250> themes

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
themes you have filled circle themes

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270 
themes you have filled circle themes
square<00:01:33.420> themes<00:01:33.750> filled<00:01:34.259> square<00:01:34.710> themes<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
square themes filled square themes and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
square themes filled square themes and
bottom<00:01:35.790> line<00:01:36.060> themes<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> these

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
bottom line themes now out of these

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.060 
bottom line themes now out of these
themes<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.530> my<00:01:40.650> favorite<00:01:40.860> would

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
themes here I think my favorite would

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
themes here I think my favorite would
probably<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.090> bottom<00:01:42.570> lines<00:01:42.840> down<00:01:43.140> here

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
probably be the bottom lines down here

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
probably be the bottom lines down here
either<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> black<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> white<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.450> blue

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
either the black and white or the blue

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
either the black and white or the blue
now<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> consideration<00:01:47.700> what

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
now if you take in consideration what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
now if you take in consideration what
they<00:01:48.750> look<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.799> color<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
they look like with this color of a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120 
they look like with this color of a
control<00:01:50.880> center<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.380> probably<00:01:52.619> go

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
control center then I would probably go

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
control center then I would probably go
with<00:01:53.159> either<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.270> black<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> white<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
with either the black and white that I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
with either the black and white that I
have<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.579> black<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> white

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have right now or the black and white

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
have right now or the black and white
right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.750> square<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> think

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
right here that's square because I think

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
right here that's square because I think
this<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.360> looks<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> best<00:02:01.290> with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this just actually looks the best with

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
this just actually looks the best with
this<00:02:01.920> color<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.399> control<00:02:02.909> center<00:02:03.240> now<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
this color of control center now you can

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120 
this color of control center now you can
actually<00:02:04.140> change<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.590> control<00:02:04.890> center

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actually change your control center

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually change your control center
color<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.670> tweaks<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.390> CC<00:02:06.960> quick<00:02:07.290> but

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
color with tweaks like CC quick but

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
color with tweaks like CC quick but
there's<00:02:08.099> also<00:02:08.280> probably<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.270> some

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
there's also probably going to be some

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
there's also probably going to be some
other<00:02:09.479> themes<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> be

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
other themes that you're going to be

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.980 
other themes that you're going to be
able<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.190> download

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
able to download

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.830 
able to download
or<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.290> tweak<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.830> well<00:02:13.460> as<00:02:13.670> changing<00:02:14.390> up<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
or this tweak as well as changing up the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.980 
or this tweak as well as changing up the
control<00:02:15.290> center<00:02:15.620> color<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.840> show

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
control center color but just to show

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.840 
control center color but just to show
you<00:02:18.020> guys<00:02:18.290> some<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.070> themes<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.610> let's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
you guys some of the themes here let's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.750 
you guys some of the themes here let's
just<00:02:20.030> jump<00:02:20.270> into<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.630> few<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.200> these<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:22.640> is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
just jump into a few of these so this is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.430 
just jump into a few of these so this is
the<00:02:22.850> bottom<00:02:23.180> line<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:23.630> when<00:02:23.810> they're<00:02:23.960> enabled

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the bottom line one when they're enabled

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.100 
the bottom line one when they're enabled
it<00:02:24.890> has<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.310> bottom<00:02:25.880> line<00:02:26.120> colored<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:26.930> well

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
it has the bottom line colored as well

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.940 
it has the bottom line colored as well
as<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> entire<00:02:29.380> icon<00:02:30.380> right<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.620> as<00:02:30.860> you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
as the entire icon right there as you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.000 
as the entire icon right there as you
can<00:02:31.100> see<00:02:31.280> when<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.490> turn<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.120> off<00:02:33.010> also

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
can see when I turn that on and off also

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.520 
can see when I turn that on and off also
on<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> green<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.790> red<00:02:35.030> green<00:02:35.900> means<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
on the green and red green means that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
on the green and red green means that
it's<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:37.010> red<00:02:37.640> means<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.300> off<00:02:39.460> so<00:02:40.460> it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
it's on red means that it's off so it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.100 
it's on red means that it's off so it
really<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:40.820> depends<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.510> what<00:02:41.930> your

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
really just depends on what your

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.030 
really just depends on what your
preference<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.710> what<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.160> think<00:02:43.460> looks<00:02:43.730> good

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
preference is what you think looks good

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.770 
preference is what you think looks good
but<00:02:46.040> definitely<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.460> pretty<00:02:46.820> cool<00:02:47.120> tweak<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
but definitely a pretty cool tweak and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.780 
but definitely a pretty cool tweak and
in<00:02:48.500> my<00:02:48.620> opinion<00:02:48.770> should<00:02:49.130> try<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.520> since

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
in my opinion should try it out since

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.450 
in my opinion should try it out since
this<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.270> free<00:02:50.780> tweak<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.070> we<00:02:52.160> jump<00:02:52.370> back

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
this is a free tweak so if we jump back

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.070 
this is a free tweak so if we jump back
here<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.120> go<00:02:53.240> into<00:02:53.450> lockscreen

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
here and we go into lockscreen

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
here and we go into lockscreen
restrictions<00:02:54.650> here<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.430> where<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:55.850> turn

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
restrictions here is where you can turn

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.120 
restrictions here is where you can turn
on<00:02:56.420> your<00:02:56.930> lock<00:02:57.230> screen<00:02:57.260> restrictions<00:02:58.010> and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
on your lock screen restrictions and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.680 
on your lock screen restrictions and
this<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.460> basically<00:02:58.790> means<00:02:59.120> when<00:02:59.270> you<00:02:59.360> open

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
this just basically means when you open

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.090 
this just basically means when you open
up<00:02:59.780> your<00:02:59.840> control<00:03:00.290> center<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.710> your<00:03:00.890> lock

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
up your control center on your lock

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.760 
up your control center on your lock
screen<00:03:01.130> these<00:03:02.000> ones<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.080> select<00:03:03.560> that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
screen these ones that you select that

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.860 
screen these ones that you select that
aren't<00:03:04.100> going<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.370> be<00:03:04.460> able<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:04.790> toggled<00:03:05.300> so

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
aren't going to be able to be toggled so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.270 
aren't going to be able to be toggled so
if<00:03:05.960> we<00:03:06.080> wanted<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.410> turn<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.950> cellular

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
if we wanted to turn on the cellular

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.100 
if we wanted to turn on the cellular
data<00:03:07.520> as<00:03:07.970> well<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.630> settings<00:03:08.930> right<00:03:09.080> here

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
data as well as the settings right here

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.140 
data as well as the settings right here
it's<00:03:09.440> already<00:03:09.650> turned<00:03:09.860> on<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.550> now<00:03:10.760> when<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.030> go

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
it's already turned on so now when we go

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's already turned on so now when we go
to<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.390> lock<00:03:11.570> screen<00:03:14.020> oops<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.560> pull<00:03:15.770> up

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
to the lock screen oops and we pull up

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.040 
to the lock screen oops and we pull up
the<00:03:16.130> control<00:03:16.640> center<00:03:16.880> here<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.270> we<00:03:17.720> tap<00:03:17.900> on

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
the control center here and we tap on

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.780 
the control center here and we tap on
cellular<00:03:18.470> data<00:03:18.650> nothing<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.550> going<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.730> happen

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
cellular data nothing is going to happen

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.080 
cellular data nothing is going to happen
as<00:03:20.240> well<00:03:20.810> as<00:03:20.990> if<00:03:21.140> we<00:03:21.290> tap<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.800> Settings<00:03:22.190> but

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
as well as if we tap on the Settings but

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.850 
as well as if we tap on the Settings but
if<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.300> tap<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:23.960> which<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.440> actually<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
if we tap on this which is actually the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.670 
if we tap on this which is actually the
respring<00:03:25.370> which<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.210> didn't<00:03:26.600> mean<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.780> tap<00:03:27.410> on

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
respring which I didn't mean to tap on

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.430 
respring which I didn't mean to tap on
it's<00:03:28.190> obviously<00:03:28.670> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.210> work<00:03:29.510> but<00:03:30.260> those

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
it's obviously going to work but those

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.930

put six per page so that you can see all
six<00:04:05.540> per<00:04:05.750> page<00:04:07.150> but<00:04:08.150> definitely<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> really

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
six per page but definitely a really

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.930 
six per page but definitely a really
cool<00:04:09.290> tweak<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.830> in<00:04:09.950> my<00:04:10.100> opinion<00:04:10.250> one<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.819> the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
cool tweak and in my opinion one of the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.960 
cool tweak and in my opinion one of the
better<00:04:11.270> control<00:04:11.900> center<00:04:12.200> tweets<00:04:12.500> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
better control center tweets and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.400 
better control center tweets and
probably<00:04:13.970> there<00:04:14.360> are<00:04:14.450> going<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:14.810> some<00:04:15.230> more

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
probably there are going to be some more

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.800
