00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.769
 the concentration that is generally like this 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.869
 he is happy with the state only 11 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.800
 days long 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.080
 18 the truth is that we played that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 out by the elections or by some 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.900
 other reasons we could not work all 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.860
 we have been able to take full advantage of these 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.720
 days we played three games and I 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.649
 I think general lines, then, the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.649
 sanitary work 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.440
 all only one week away 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.760
 for the beginning of the pontifical and good 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 I believe that the team is prepared 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 to face already officially 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.310
 with the party it is clear that the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.980
 result what's important in this kind of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.080
 parties is practically happy and 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.050
 satisfied with what was done in these 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.060
 matches were matches but on 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.010
 only and exclusively trainings 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 then they serve to go together 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.130
 computer systems easier yet 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.869
 has a match to find you and for the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.490
 very hot afternoon it was a match 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.110
 difficult to play because practically 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 the games could not move 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.010
 when we could come easy by 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.390
 statism 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.670
 the second match 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.860
 the session was much better 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 of it in the temperature had dropped and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.900
 the good team because it simulated very well the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.400
 work that we wanted to do and it saw a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 important improvement with respect to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 First 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.950
 sad 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.140
 Y 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.069
 and today we have the last game before 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.750
 of the return trip and well let's see 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 if the team responds to a similar line 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.549
 to the previous party and speakers as 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.790
 profiled by practicing in all 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.790
 things 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.180
 the colics of the mystic spirits 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.240
 we did this year being a group of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.010
 work and footballers of roots 6 bulnes 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.990
 who sing europe could balance 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.060
 physically to be able the others 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.710
 used to have it with us and the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 players that are out to the 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.440
 internationally geographically and be 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.900
 matched 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.460
 it's not difficult because practically the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.260
 international players have been 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.640
 editions 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.460
 you down worth austere because you are 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.050
 burgess a lot of bustamante and 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.190
 they have another training rhythm 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.200
 because they are competing 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.150
 they were competing and logically the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.920
 training is much lower than the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.459
 that your colleagues have done here in 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.459
 preseason 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.620
 if not 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.100
 different for money or time everything 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.490
 changed in the robbery that has some title 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.490
 with the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:05.190
 then the equipment arrives in conditions 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.190
 to physically match 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.550
 no no no 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.570
 m 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.570
 from across our country to keep 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 guys happy with the preparation and with 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 the game 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.169
 good is 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 the only power player has come 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.680
 central defense in a position that 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.199
 we had very weak we only had to 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.330
 central and at least have three 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.830
 unemployed put then a little more than 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.960
 quiet then take a little 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.020
 time the lyon is trying to adapt 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.120
 and collaborating to the maximum people with the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.979
 colleagues and for the moment we are 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.979
 happy with your considerate 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.960
 yes 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.030
 one 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.599
 threw up
