 I also want to talk to you about the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.729
 great news that the soldier all a little 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.220
 scanner of the entire community of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.619
 gamers that come what playstation 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.039
 4 a project that has been called orbs 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.300
 that this is not the regular name but it is 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.320
 the name that you have been given when 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.540
 they start working 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 they have to name in some way is not 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.130
 that if it's going to be called so that's the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.410
 Orbis name that you have been given and what is going 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 to go through with this is that they have tried to 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.399
 do the same as the iphone 720 the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.520
 rumors that have happened is that you're not going to 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.680
 be able to play used games what is going to 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 be alone and supposedly you're going to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.240
 have to buy a game you're going to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.700
 have to do to put together a lincoln with 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.150
 you with your playstation network account 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.520
 and then when that happens already another 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.470
 person wants to buy a game use no 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.989
 will be able to use it to completely up 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.820
 that buy the online pass everything is everything 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.580
 as he said it is pure business to go up 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.140
 which is not very good but remember 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.150
 there are many companies this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.820
 they can lose a lot of money like amazon 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 efe here in the USA to install so I 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.150
 I think they are going to scream 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.620
 the sky and they will try to stop this 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.840
 On the other hand I also want to talk to you 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.709
 about the games that are coming and this 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.420
 week 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.709
 I think it was around this day that 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.050
 I started hearing rumors about the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.630
 white acts that have already started talking to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.070
 talk a little more about that talk with 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.450
 two supposedly going to leave for 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.400
 November 13 what 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.560
 the truth is not a surprise because this 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.959
 is when you always take out activision and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.959
 these companies do the games of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.900
 colors but to the saying that supposedly 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.489
 to a white everything is going to have to be van 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 to be almost alike so wolffer 3 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.180
 the ways to get cues 3 go 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 to be based on objectives and points for 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.709
 example you capture a flag a point 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 you put a bomb two points and all that 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.069
 one of the things and I want in school 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040
 sells monthly from the camera is that the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.330
 blank cart 2 will disappear already 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.069
 it will not be here so 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.830
 pitifully those of us who were fans of 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.500
 We're going to lose it, we're not going to 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.049
 have but there is another very good thing that 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.690
 I was reading that he is going to have 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.549
 a type of look that you will be able to use and 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.530
 you will be able to see through the walls 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.349
 so if you're going to see a camper there 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.599
 lying down and hiding in a corner 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.700
 Now with that kind of look, you're going to 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.180
 to be able to see what I do very very 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.250
 good for white 2 so waiting 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.079
 for November 13 supposedly going to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.370
 come out you have to see what is going to 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.590
 I also want to talk about 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.390
 another game called sleeping dogs 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.460

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.950
 demonstrated a by a couple of photos and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.070

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.470

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.450
