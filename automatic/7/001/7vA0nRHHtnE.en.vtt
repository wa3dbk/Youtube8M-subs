00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 in this video was a dash tips point 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.980
 NL 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.589
 let's see how to milk chocolate 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.510
 can remove from clothing before 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.360
 In this video we use a piece of t-shirt 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 made from 100% cotton and a cup 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 chocolatemilk 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 we pour a little chocolate milk 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.140
 the piece of t-shirt 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 as you can see, draw the chocolate milk 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 directly in clothing for the effect 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.410
 let's also have the chocolate milk 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.939
 moving in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 the first step against chocolate milk 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 stains is to rinse the stain out with 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 cold water 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 Pay attention that you do not have hot water 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.989
 used but that causes the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 stain is harder to remove 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's important not to be hard 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 rub because then you do the stain deeper 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.590
 in the clothes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.930
 we let you flush quickly 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 and as you can see it is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.469
 most of the stain already out 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.120
 and what remains between part of the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 chocolate milk deep into the t-shirt 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 squat is what you need against 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.520
 chocolate milk stains is a mix of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 salt and water 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 the salt causes the chocolate 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.899
 sucked out of the t-shirt 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.820
 put a little salt in a bucket and fill 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.400
 this with warm water 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 soak the garment in it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.869
 leave this for about 1 to 2 hours 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.799
 we have this time in the video 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.799
 cut out in between 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 as you can see the spot is almost now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 disappeared 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 The last step is to get the item of clothing 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.590
 washing in the washing machine 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.680
 to show the effect well we do 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 that in this video was with one hand 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.990
 fill a bucket with lukewarm water and mix 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.850
 liquid detergent 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 put the garment in and rub it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 slowly together 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.520
 you do this until the stain 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 completely disappeared 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.790
 as you can see the stain is there then 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 also completely out 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.920
 good luck and for more tips
