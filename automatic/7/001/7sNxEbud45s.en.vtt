00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.049
 hello ward number 6 as always 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.179
 health as always on your knees today 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.529
 I would like to talk about those changes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.740
 which the ganzo g704 model has undergone 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 during the year we have two knives 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.680
 both knives were taken on ex doct price 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.539
 it is different that this knife is cleaned in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.390
 end of 2012 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.970
 and the knife was taken in late 2011 and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.650
 this past year this model 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.019
 underwent several pleasant changes 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.680
 in my opinion and about it i want now 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.440
 talk mean change first 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.299
 steel masonry thickness for 10 that is if 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.750
 we are now like this he is even visually 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.629
 even compare now visually show 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.369
 it can be seen that the pads have become much thicker 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.460
 on the new model we are new model on the right 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.110
 this thickness has become more grown somewhere 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.850
 about one millimeter it allowed 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 compared to the old model hide 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.050
 g lining screws 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.750
 Thai sessions pay attention to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:31.940
 old model we have these screws stick over 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 on the new model these screws 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.500
 faithfully drowned second change 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.590
 which we find on these models 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.320
 This is marking the blade on older models. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.060
 marking looked like this 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770
 that is, the media logo of the hanse and closer to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.790
 butt 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:01.580
 440c steel marking 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:04.890
 new model we see markers 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.210
 the ganzo logo here they are on the left side 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.670
 butt on the right side of the butt we see 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:18.000
 marking g704 and 447 which are already 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.780
 done in a stamp not any other 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.310
 type of application let's say the following 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.710
 the moment to which I would like 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.770
 pay attention this availability 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:35.000
 micro feed i will try to show our 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:41.910
 same notice the game is still a trick 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 tourists at the same time the manufacturerâ€™s price is not 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:53.930
 changed as original price by x to 18 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:59.700
 dollars so it remains it cannot 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:02.430
 let's say so not considered 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.239
 the positive moment in general is this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.300
 I really liked the moment 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.670
 there is a ganza company to worry about their 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 consumer companies ganzo develops 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.850
 and let such small 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.090
 small changes they are present and 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.810
 let this small step succeed with these 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:30.299
 small changes this step 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:33.620
 to meet us the consumer here 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.620
