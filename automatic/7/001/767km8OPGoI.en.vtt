00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.230
 at this moment we will do in case 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.450
 the basic catchers whose casualties 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.880
 movement will become totally supinatory 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.490
 follow the vote outside 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.430
 elbows locked fists maximum 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.430
 possible and the brother will not be brought 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.129
 forward and bring you to the side of the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.540
 it hurts here the lateral doctor gives this 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.670
 specific movement for the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 neighbors because it's footprint goes 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.500
 fit when talking a little outside the cable 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.780
 and works without raising the goal of the villa 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.210
 everything is the maximum that works and 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.940
 full wave when selected for in 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.190
 up, you can tell that the fist does not 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.730
 has inflection only goalkeeper feature 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 total extension total flexion forces 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.899
 bigger in the little finger than in the thumb 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.540
 always order out 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.940
 this movement in the inner part of the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.720
 vices is as if it were a direct thread 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.700
 open 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.100
 only we are doing in the cables that 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.590
 she weighs five pounds here five pounds 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.399
 here are five kilos here and five kilos in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.000
 maximum extent because of new first 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.130
 series matters and goes up to bankruptcy 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.280
 this bankruptcy is very simplified 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.180
 for you guys 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 always do number of meals 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.780
 with the control 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.450
 if it is out of control there will pass 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.370
 for what your vote is more 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.980
 party that is striking exhaustion or 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.500
 exaggerated bullet and passing from the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.750
 musician these last two and pressures or 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.060
 two or three last sessions is that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.220
 really do reference but have a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:07.520
 control but you 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.229
 the second series again the open thread the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.140
 Little finger will do more strength than 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.510
 thumb and it will bring a hands 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.730
 lateral deltoid and do not close as if 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.560
 it was a difficult course total election 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.170
 everything you should fold and everything you should 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.270
 extend control without relaxing and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.480
 leave the weight to the situation 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.300
 this movement remembering again part 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.850
 internal medial physical 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.270
 again it goes to bankruptcy of a geek 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.910
 finished again we did not increase the load 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.660
 we made with the same three bricks in the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.880
 case 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.530
 this movement also does not have to do 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.080
 end overload 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.760
 if you want you can but the movement does not 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.620
 we are giving little rest time 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.959
 making maximum competition from the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.510
 first and third we go 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.370
 make a control without the one thrown 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.870
 everything is not a move for this if 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.480
 whether it was a direct thread or five 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.510
 alternating we could of the 11 th 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.590
 and this move make high rock loads 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.230
 another series 3 series 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 again even weight account every 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.459
 basic principles realize that it will 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.130
 reach the maximum limit of reflection 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.870
 the baby can afford it he will not try 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.850
 doubling but that will not achieve 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.100
 even because with this volume of arm in the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.440
 air you double large amount it goes 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.920
 to exhaustion and all movement 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.290
 maximum extension and or gives a slight 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.829
 forced repetitions to arrive at 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 repetition limit in every ten that 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.220
 ready two moves three series same 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.600
 loading from the beginning always going to the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.540
 bankruptcy 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.910
 I do not talk about being negative, okay, and extension. 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.920
 maximum contraction in this movement 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.740
 internal part of the bits 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.220
 in another specific movement for height 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.320
 try to isolate the bishops of Brazil the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.320
 third exercise 13 certainly
