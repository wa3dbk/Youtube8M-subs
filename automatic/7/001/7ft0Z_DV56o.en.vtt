00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 and here maurizio morelli then maurizio 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.120
 we have glasses in front of us there 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 we go back to sports glasses a lot 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.920
 used and asked us in the comments and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
 to explain how to change lenses 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 so we read your comments and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 what we can we salute 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.490
 maurice explains how to change them 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.170
 lenses to these glasses 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 if this is a model of glasses that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.800
 they are among the most popular ones in the world 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 because they are Americans or generated 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 they are for me they are the best ones then 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.350
 of personal judgment as we do 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.059
 see how to change a lens 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 winter like these I stretched yellow 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 which is used for foggy days 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.520
 or in the woods anyway those 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 dark days we go to put one 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 summer lens ok so the yellow la 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.680
 then we will use the jana we will use it for the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.910
 fog and fog and this one instead 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 people for the summer 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:08.490
 then first we go to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.990
 unhook the sides so then widen the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.409
 2 st way is absolutely so 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 the operation the glasses are broken 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 because they are made on purpose as it can give 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 even stronger after that we go to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:30.680
 make pressure from the clubs make you go 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.680
 below so that this comes out like this 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 ok we are on the site 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.970
 after which the snow is in the hake 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 we push it gently push it 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:52.860
 we push so that this comes out 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.260
 then it is not very easy for me now 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.680
 because I had him supported 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.450
 because it rests on the first physical table 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.619
 trance of how it puts true as it is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.000
 done 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.280
 here there is also the hake that can be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.950
 change to put it more model 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 long for xl a tv of a little tooth 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.730
 longer longer than lanese heat 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.910
 here there is written just made in usa 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 go go michael current let's go to 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:28.350
 put now let's do it backwards 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:34.010
 first we insert and then the hake 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.010
 we do so then we put the hake 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.670
 this one side 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.019
 we need rejected 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:58.180
 I go home but be careful 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.940
 otherwise shoulders error I made 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 first you have to right here now has it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.910
 taken well to insert just the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:16.000
 hake then the born 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:25.360
 this is one side this is the other at 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.200
 entry ok me time so we got back 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.240
 on profiles and therefore one does not want it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.220
 so much is done in real time via togli e 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.320
 put without trying from explanations from 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.960
 see a little how long it would take if you 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.910
 you're going on a day like 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.130
 today, however, the sun enters a forest 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.040
 while in a genoa forest after 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.130
 I want to change glasses because if one 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.840
 it starts tonight because it's not like mica 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.620
 you need that 48 this you put 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.330
 the other is because it is yes because you can 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.510
 go out in the morning with glasses from 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.800
 sun and I need the evening of 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.390
 split us equal but be repaired 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.310
 especially in the descents on the return e 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.320
 says without explanation it takes a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.600
 perfect moment we waste time for 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.880
 explain very well then it's fine 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.140
 we have satisfied this too 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.700
 comment so if you have others 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.190
 questions to ask on the bike that 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.480
 that we can do the tutorial 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.480
