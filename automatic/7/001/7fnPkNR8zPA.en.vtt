00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the place where everybody throws

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
the place where everybody throws
grenades<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> start<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
grenades at the start and you know you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
grenades at the start and you know you
could<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.129> survive<00:01:02.460> three<00:01:03.149> maybe<00:01:03.390> four

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
could probably survive three maybe four

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.460 
could probably survive three maybe four
grenade<00:01:04.140> throws<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.850> yeah<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
grenade throws and yeah it's it you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050 
grenade throws and yeah it's it you can
get<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.770> done<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.369> quickly<00:01:08.610> guys<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
get this done really quickly guys you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.630 
get this done really quickly guys you
could<00:01:09.150> probably<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> done<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> game

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
could probably get this done in a game

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
could probably get this done in a game
another<00:01:11.640> another<00:01:12.150> thing<00:01:12.479> it'd<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
another another thing it'd be kind of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
another another thing it'd be kind of
think<00:01:14.070> where<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:15.000> claymores<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
think where you would put claymores and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
think where you would put claymores and
run<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> those<00:01:16.380> places<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.220> run<00:01:18.119> one

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
run to those places and just run one

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
run to those places and just run one
through<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.439> guys<00:01:19.920> this

I<00:01:39.750> would<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.560> advise<00:01:40.890> defusing<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> bomb

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
I would not advise defusing the bomb

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
I would not advise defusing the bomb
well<00:01:42.030> obviously<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> chance<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
well obviously if you get the chance to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
well obviously if you get the chance to
defuse<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> bomb<00:01:44.220> defuse<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> bomb<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.750> i

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
defuse the bomb defuse the bomb but i

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
defuse the bomb defuse the bomb but i
would<00:01:45.990> say<00:01:46.229> plant<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> bomb<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> lot<00:01:48.299> easier

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
would say plant the bomb is a lot easier

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.010 
would say plant the bomb is a lot easier
than<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.020> fuse<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> bomb<00:01:49.759> but<00:01:50.759> yeah

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020

always another thing that you will see
me<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.370> check<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.450> scoreboard<00:02:38.760> I'm

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760

probably<00:02:39.879> not<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.329> do<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.629> now<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:41.019> the

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
probably not going to do it now just the

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.130 
probably not going to do it now just the
undermine<00:02:42.159> what<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:42.489> saying<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.690> yet<00:02:43.840> check

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
undermine what I'm saying but yet check

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.099 
undermine what I'm saying but yet check
the<00:02:44.170> scoreboard<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.299> make<00:02:46.870> sure

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
the scoreboard and you just make sure

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.990 
the scoreboard and you just make sure
that<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.349> can<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.739> who's<00:02:48.010> alive<00:02:48.370> who's<00:02:48.760> not

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that you can see who's alive who's not

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.210 
that you can see who's alive who's not
alive<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.540> see<00:02:50.410> how<00:02:50.560> many<00:02:50.680> people<00:02:50.920> you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
alive just see how many people you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.800 
alive just see how many people you
expect<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.879> I<00:02:51.940> wouldn't<00:02:52.150> usually<00:02:52.299> plant<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
expect it I wouldn't usually plant the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.420 
expect it I wouldn't usually plant the
bomb<00:02:52.959> until<00:02:53.109> there's<00:02:53.590> only<00:02:53.769> about<00:02:53.920> two<00:02:54.250> people

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bomb until there's only about two people

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.479 
bomb until there's only about two people
left<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:56.410> way<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.590> minimizing<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
left and that way you minimizing the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.720 
left and that way you minimizing the
risk<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:58.030> dying<00:02:58.980> yeah<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.579> that's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
risk of dying yeah and that that's

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.250 
risk of dying yeah and that that's
pretty<00:03:00.940> much<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.329> this<00:03:01.480> guy's<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:04.260> think

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
pretty much it for this guy's is I think

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.910 
pretty much it for this guy's is I think
this<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.590> second<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.980> last<00:03:06.010> one<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.920> it's
