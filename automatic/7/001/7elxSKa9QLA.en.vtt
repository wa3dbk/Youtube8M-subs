00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
and then over time that we just said

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.200 
and then over time that we just said
we've<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> better<00:01:02.309> job<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:03.059> this

300<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.409> defensive<00:01:35.860> line<00:01:36.009> I<00:01:36.780> thought<00:01:37.780> they

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
300 a defensive line I thought they

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.289 
300 a defensive line I thought they

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
thought the whole defense really worked

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.569 
thought the whole defense really worked
late<00:01:40.450> hard<00:01:41.040> fought<00:01:42.040> hard<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:44.799> some<00:01:45.399> big
