00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.430
 Y 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900
 ah 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.540
 welcome to my cooking channel today in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 the kitchen 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.120
 We are going to prepare a delicious dip of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.340
 spinach and cheese this day this snack 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 it has the peculiarity that it is served 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 hot and it's really very easy to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 prepare let's see what are the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 ingredients I here have spinach that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.019
 it came frozen and that I defrosted and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 this also shred with multi 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.510
 processor so that it is like a puree 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.250
 very important to drain all the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 liquid if you buy spinach 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.070
 fresh come from exactly the same 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 way it's already cooked we're going to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.680
 need a whole package of cheese 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.380
 cream of this type philadelphia a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.899
 spoonful of sour cream 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.869
 some tablespoons of parmesan cheese 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.840
 grating cheese and what I have here 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.180
 it's also a piece of feta cheese this 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.399
 is this Greek cheese that can be 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.520
 shelling like this and it's pretty 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.009
 salty if you do not get cheese 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 Feta do not worry this is an added 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.720
 to this recipe but it is really very 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.870
 well we are also going to use garlic in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.120
 salt and pepper powder to taste 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.720
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.240
 Preheat the oven to 170 180 degrees 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 maximum and we will also have list 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 some quote source of these type you ask 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.350
 they can go in the oven and let good 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.660
 start in a deep bowl for 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.760
 work comfortable and this is very simple 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.690
 The first thing we are going to do is place 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.690
 the cream cheese 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.650
 and a good spoonful of the cream 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.440
 Sour sour cream gives a little touch 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.080
 really very special with the help of some 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.710
 varices we are going to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.860
 mix both the two things well 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.470
 that everything is well united and creamy 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.750
 that's why it's ideal that creamy cheese 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.069
 be at room temperature to be 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.049
 easier 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.049
 let's also add the spinach 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.560
 and feta cheese with the help of a 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.560
 fork 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.900
 and unarmed we're going to create it also to the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.900
 preparation 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.959
 ah 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.650
 and once we have everything incorporated 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.360
 I now change a spoon because it is 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.360
 more comfortable let's season it 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.850
 with garlic powder 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.980
 ground pepper 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.709
 and a little touch of salt remember that 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.409
 have used feta cheese is already 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.850
 quite salty so the ideal is 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.490
 taste and season to taste 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.260
 the preparation is actually ready 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.750
 so what we're going to do is prepare 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.780
 the mold cited and I what I'm doing 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 here is to brush the entire mold with a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.400
 little oil 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.730
 and now if we only have to place the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.090
 mix of spinach and cheese inside 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.090
 mold 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.010
 then we are going to accommodate all the 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:51.349
 preparation as young as possible 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.260
 and the last thing we have left to do is 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.019
 place generous amounts of cheese 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.060
 parmesan above that is what is going to 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.200
 make it then gratin when 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.200
 we take it to the oven 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.400
 and now if you just want to take us 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.190
 our baked until all the cheese 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.480
 is well golden about 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.480
 10 to 15 minutes 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.240
 the day is ready and you do not know 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:27.660

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.880

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.500
 be like kings at any party 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.509

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.810
