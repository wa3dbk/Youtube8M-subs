back in the carpet and into the padding
this<00:00:31.320> will<00:00:31.470> work<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.890> much<00:00:32.099> better<00:00:32.399> than<00:00:32.640> using

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this will work so much better than using

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.630

the urine down into the padding a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.440 
the urine down into the padding a
wetback<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.890> actually<00:00:38.219> pull<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.760> there

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
wetback will actually pull it up there

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.990 
wetback will actually pull it up there
for<00:00:39.809> removing<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> liquid<00:00:41.610> urine

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
