00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.670 
and also so I can't look at the week
we'll<00:02:29.060> see<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.659> some<00:02:29.870> white<00:02:30.079> heads<00:02:30.409> we

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
we'll see we have some white heads we

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.589 
we'll see we have some white heads we
have<00:02:30.709> some<00:02:31.069> brown<00:02:31.280> heads<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.939> that's<00:02:32.120> because

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
have some brown heads and that's because

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.170 
have some brown heads and that's because
of<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> blend

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
of the blend

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.820 
of the blend
it<00:02:35.180> looks<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> me<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.050> most<00:02:36.080> rock<00:02:36.620> on

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
it looks to me like the most rock on

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.830 
it looks to me like the most rock on
this<00:02:36.980> particular<00:02:37.340> passage<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.540> dominance

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
this particular passage is the dominance

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.119 
this particular passage is the dominance
but<00:02:40.200> overall<00:02:40.980> I'd<00:02:41.370> say<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> Santa<00:02:43.980> Fe

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
but overall I'd say that the Santa Fe

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.420 
but overall I'd say that the Santa Fe
has<00:02:44.280> been

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
has been

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.550 
has been

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
has been showing up as somewhere better

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.220 
has been showing up as somewhere better

one<00:03:03.270> more<00:03:03.480> year<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.310> decided<00:03:05.640> we'd<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
one more year and we decided we'd take a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.390 
one more year and we decided we'd take a
chance<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.720> word<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.140> no-till<00:03:07.500> situation

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
chance on a word a no-till situation

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.490 
chance on a word a no-till situation
where<00:03:08.790> our<00:03:08.820> difficult<00:03:09.540> rotation<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.290> two

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
where our difficult rotation is two

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.090 
where our difficult rotation is two
years<00:03:10.740> we<00:03:11.070> see<00:03:12.000> years<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.480> Milo<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:13.110> year<00:03:13.470> sweet

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
years we see years of Milo a year sweet

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.460 
years we see years of Milo a year sweet
beans<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:16.490> so<00:03:17.490> we<00:03:17.730> try<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> stay<00:03:18.180> ahead<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
beans and so we try to stay ahead of the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.950 
beans and so we try to stay ahead of the
disease<00:03:19.770> pressure<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.910> weed<00:03:21.330> infested

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
received about an instant when T and

received about an instant when T and
March<00:03:59.310> and<00:04:00.310> then<00:04:01.180> April<00:04:01.569> was<00:04:01.750> dry<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.290> May<00:04:02.470> we

received three inches and that's

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.890 
received three inches and that's
probably<00:04:05.080> why<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.440> week<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.100> looking

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
probably why this week is looking

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.160 
probably why this week is looking
but<00:04:08.799> we<00:04:08.920> also<00:04:09.040> had<00:04:09.430> high<00:04:10.120> temperatures<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.959> had

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
but we also had high temperatures we had

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.250 
but we also had high temperatures we had
temperatures<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.829> excess<00:04:11.920> 400<00:04:12.640> degrees<00:04:12.989> for

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
for several days in May and we thought

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.140 
for several days in May and we thought
that<00:04:19.660> was<00:04:20.019> ready<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.829> go<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:20.979> damage<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.609> we<00:04:21.639> put

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
that was ready to go to damage so we put

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.120 
that was ready to go to damage so we put
it<00:04:22.300> in<00:04:22.510> fact<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.930> don't<00:04:23.169> think<00:04:23.380> really<00:04:23.830> hurting

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
it in fact I don't think really hurting

it in fact I don't think really hurting
my<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.340> begin

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.620 

we<00:04:28.260> moved<00:04:28.500> about<00:04:28.770> one<00:04:29.490> gulley<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.480> then

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
we moved about one gulley and then

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.930 
we moved about one gulley and then
hippest<00:04:31.050> Rumble<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.560> several<00:04:31.919> years<00:04:32.190> in<00:04:32.639> a

to drag dirt around since we never till

to drag dirt around since we never till
and<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:42.570> only<00:04:42.690> way<00:04:42.840> we<00:04:42.990> can<00:04:43.050> really<00:04:43.229> patch

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
and the only way we can really patch

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.710 
and the only way we can really patch
gullies<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.699> carry<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.150> dirt<00:04:45.330> from<00:04:45.479> one

interesting<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:13.199> year<00:05:13.470> is<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> number<00:05:14.310> of

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
interesting this year is a number of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.659 
interesting this year is a number of
turtledoves<00:05:14.759> I've<00:05:15.150> seen<00:05:15.389> in<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.659> wheat

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
turtledoves I've seen in the wheat

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.010 
turtledoves I've seen in the wheat
they're<00:05:17.669> laying<00:05:17.879> their<00:05:18.150> eggs<00:05:18.180> in<00:05:18.569> wheat<00:05:18.840> this

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
they're laying their eggs in wheat this

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.899 
they're laying their eggs in wheat this
year<00:05:19.849> normally<00:05:20.849> they<00:05:21.000> do<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:23.699> been

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
year normally they do but it's been

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.219 
year normally they do but it's been
interesting<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.599> think<00:05:24.659> we're<00:05:24.960> going<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.110> have

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
interesting I think we're going to have

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.140 
interesting I think we're going to have
a<00:05:25.259> large<00:05:25.500> population<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:26.310> turtledoves<00:05:26.729> this

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
a large population of turtledoves this

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.119 
a large population of turtledoves this
year<00:05:27.419> just<00:05:27.569> for<00:05:28.319> the<00:05:28.379> fact<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.860> they've<00:05:29.099> been

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
year just for the fact that they've been

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.500 
year just for the fact that they've been
nesting<00:05:29.930> we

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
nesting we

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.270 
nesting we
so<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:32.170> been<00:05:32.350> kind<00:05:32.560> of<00:05:32.650> fun<00:05:32.710> watching<00:05:33.040> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
so it's been kind of fun watching the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.620 
so it's been kind of fun watching the
flyer<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:34.720> also<00:05:35.440> there's<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.770> fairly<00:05:36.490> large

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
flyer and also there's a fairly large

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.549 
flyer and also there's a fairly large
population<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.750> fish<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.200> whales<00:05:38.410> come<00:05:38.770> again

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
population of fish and whales come again

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.219 
population of fish and whales come again
so<00:05:40.979> by<00:05:41.369> harvesting<00:05:42.239> you<00:05:42.359> get<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.659> see<00:05:42.869> some<00:05:43.139> of

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
so by harvesting you get to see some of

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.679 
so by harvesting you get to see some of
these<00:05:43.819> things<00:05:44.819> that<00:05:45.119> normally<00:05:45.479> you<00:05:45.569> know

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
these things that normally you know

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.429 
these things that normally you know
definitely<00:05:46.109> get<00:05:46.469> to<00:05:46.589> see<00:05:46.769> otherwise
