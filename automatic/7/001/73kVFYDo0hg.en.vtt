relationships and I think that's a main

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
relationships and I think that's a main
reason<00:01:38.189> nor<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.520> interview<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.540> know

how we hit it off and click click ting

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.950 
how we hit it off and click click ting
that<00:01:41.520> interview<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> why<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.689> might<00:01:42.810> have

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that interview is why they might have

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.450
