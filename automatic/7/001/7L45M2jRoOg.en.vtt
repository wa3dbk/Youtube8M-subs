 I'm sorry 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 victim of what 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.750
 it was a promise 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.510
 destination 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 it's a banal 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.790
 we had a season 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.700
 you do not talk too much about mistakes 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 go to the reasonable rescue 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.300

 he knows everything we have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.810
 - as his drawings 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 in the program 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.590

 it's a lot 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 besides that about oneself dare-dare 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.630
 like this position 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.740

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.790
