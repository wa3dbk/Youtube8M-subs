00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 What else are you looking at, my face? 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.009
 Is everyone talking about this cake there? 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 I do not even think it's cake, I do not think it 's 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.050
 Stew 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.820
 Let's see started well at the show here. 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 staff are welcome to the detail that 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.310
 I am but it will not be there and today we 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.590
 Let's do an experiment together. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260
 is circulating on the internet a recipe 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.480
 very mega ultra mega simple cake 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
 with only three ingredients it only that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 It's the simplest cake in the world right now. 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.239
 thing I've seen on the face of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.239
 land is an owner who takes no flour 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.449
 The basis of this cake is very simple, I 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have 120 grams here and the 120 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.969
 grams of crack schizzi I have three 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.850
 eggs that were separated 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 half is separating whites and gems 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 so we have half half here and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 I have here 120 grams of chocolate 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.430
 melted white and will remember for you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.680
 white chocolate does not try to melt 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 because it could burn the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.860
 sugar and white chocolate is not 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.360
 chocolate is a mixture of fat with 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 sugar only the guy does not have the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.579
 characteristics of a chocolate 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 ah I'll get a cream cheese put 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.810
 here in the already melted chocolate in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.900
 Maria and I'm going to start 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.869
 incorporate a business in the other or only 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.369
 mix with each other nothing more 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
 when you realize that your mix 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.409
 It's getting homogeneous , you leave it there. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.430
 rest a little do not need 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.740
 expect to cool 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 but it does not get very hot 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.969
 not because you're going to put the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 gems inside if it is too hot in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.810
 instead of gemstones incorporating together with 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 the mass what will happen will become the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.030
 Cooked yolk and you do not want it to have 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.099
 two ways one is you play the gems and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.649
 Mix quickly, it's too hot. 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.460
 or you get a little bit that those 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.740
 I call it tempering. 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.310
 you take a little bit of the mixture that 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
 will use play within the gem story is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.580
 That 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.880
 the little bit of mass that you 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.760
 played in here and there her chances to 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.400
 cooking are much smaller then o there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.000
 goes our 3 gems into the mix 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 now vigorously what we are going to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.720
 do it now 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.850
 leave her aside for a minute take the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.350
 three clear and oh come here in 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.240
 I had already put a little one 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 just to help because the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.460
 What am I going to do? 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.890
 the drummer the whites in good snow 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.260
 staff the agent who is a clear on snow 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.110
 in point to firm 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.350
 I mean, look, she's watching. She looks like this. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.220
 it even forms the dots 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.680
 a raw egg and then the cool story that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.990
 You will incorporate this clear snow 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.580
 in the mass you are doing you do not 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.130
 will beat vigorously 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.370
 You'll slowly put it but it's a 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.220
 first mix of this one 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.920
 for it will already begin to go to that mass 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.480
 and the mass gets lighter now I can 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.500
 put all the rest of the clear in snow 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.270
 also incorporate what I like about 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.030
 do to incorporate snow white 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.820
 always take it from below and bring it up 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.210
 An ice - cream gets caught from below 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.240
 and is thus incorporated into the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.550
 few and your dough will look fluffy 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.590
 you want a floph mass does not make 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.390
 The way I 'm showing you I 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.630
 I do not think there's going to be a cake from here. 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.950
 maximum will be a cell phone a souffle 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.520
 musicians edu 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.840
 I'll love it if I 'm wrong. 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.430
 cool is that if you discover things 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.200
 then you will only discover things 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.850
 new is what you think what you 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.330
 you think you got it wrong 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.910
 now we'll get a way that I 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.310
 I chose a round to a 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.570
 so there is no need to have 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.500
 removable background 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.640
 It's even better until I have not 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.650
 I made this protection with the paper 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.420
 butter take a look in here 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.920
 Boot comes does not have paper there butter in the 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.500
 background have paper butter 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.110
 on the sides that is to ensure that later 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.320
 I can get it right, guys. 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.100
 take down now but here it is 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.530
 watching things air balls in the mass 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.040
 this is the guarantee that putin heaven will 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.390
 stay very, very fan of the recipe 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.520
 that I found on the internet is talking 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.030
 that has to be done in a water bath 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.590
 so I'm going to put my little apple 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.200
 here inside 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.540
 the water I used to melt the 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.230
 chocolate that's hot I'll put 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.340
 here and back until about half and 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:18.230
 now the oven was already happening at 160 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:21.050
 degrees to and are now 15 minutes to 180 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.900
 degrees 15 minutes at 160 degrees and 15 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.970
 minutes with oven off hot 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.930
 with him still inside to get to the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.930
 point you need 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.590
 Incredibly incredible staff, I do not 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.780
 I have and I'm not sure we'll just go 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.110
 knowing when to cut but give a 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.930
 Look at this today and you do not look 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.860
 I do not like cake 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.940
 believed 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.870
 Let's cut and see if it really is a 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.270
 cake 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.270
 the apple tree 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:08.180
 op to draw the teco 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:11.599
 comes closer the question is 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:21.800
 growing eye on the grinding wheel face to 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:23.719
 O that you know where it goes by honey 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.580
 ease of the cake by the speed of 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.819
 preparation and the bad science that 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.069
 then tell me mine plays a jelly 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.349
 of hot red fruit on top 11 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.150
 This is going to be a sin 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.490

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.590
