00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 I still play for a new video 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.120
 I was asked to make tags and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 knowing that I had a tag hanging around 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.260
 there for a moment I say not like I 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.000
 am going to do this good idea 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.940
 montag is the fear on horseback between 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 parentheses so are you afraid I create them 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 and I myself have the right to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.199
 do even if I think that there has 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 few people but at the end of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.449
 video 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 you have absolutely the right to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.039
 do you just say that these two months 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
 there will be no problem I'm not I 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 think big selfish of you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.920
 take no good taguil to me here you are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.809
 do it really if you fancy you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.980
 do it here please be sure if 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 you to charm and well done of so we 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 will go to the first question is 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.930
 all that people who follow 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 it's a tag that is done in 12 questions 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.480
 1 the horse to turn his back on the boks 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 you're scared it depends on the horse we're going 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.020
 to say that there are horses the gust shock 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 in whom I trust in this game he 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 I had to turn my back I did not care 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.699
 I was coming back because I knew he 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.050
 was not going to take long to believe this 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 that I did not like at all I knew that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 if I returned while he was turning the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.640
 back I had to take a shot so yes 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.950
 I was afraid of the good times of the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 horse second question the horse that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.260
 you have to climb to a crazy reputation 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 is he afraid if I do not know him from 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 all yes because I say shit to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.860
 play fall it will make Russia and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 everything if it shocks you I know and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.939
 that I know I know what is this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 that he does like bullshit not on 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.790
 your clever I ride it all the time 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 before and he was doing pirouettes she 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 was leaving African to rear up this 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.290
 sheep and all and I was dead over 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 laugh that other thing also have three 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.840
 stamped do not want you to pin it and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 try to bite 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 are you afraid generally not especially if he 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.049
 already has the net or halter before 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.960
 comma 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.790
 sorry the cat especially if it happens 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.580
 nicole nets before in general a gesture 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.590
 from the hand 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.190
 like that he stops trying a shit 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.960
 what four arrivals in the career he 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.530
 cold the wind gets up your horse 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.870
 sparrow 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 are you scared yes it's completely 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.050
 really a situation that I do not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.420
 not bear that he really stresses me 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.760
 in my club actually the horses they 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.250
 lived only in boxing during my old 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.300
 club with boxing and suddenly when we 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.100
 is in the quarry and he was doing 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.420
 cold in winter the choices he had 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.630
 that a desire was to go to the bottom 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.770
 to let off steam and finally blow the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.240
 makes it cold and there is a 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.070
 little wind and the horse he is and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560
 it's well I knew the recovery 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.170
 was going to be a little muscular and suddenly bah 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 it stresses me I do not like this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.480
 sensation or even before you go up 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.130
 already know that you will break your mouth 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.630
 five rounds mono you tell yourself that you're going 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.690
 ride a very young horse to jump 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.610
 do not you fear especially but 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.780
 I'm still on my guard because 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.180
 that a young horse that did not 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.430
 skip it's a big jump of goat 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.220
 generally so that's to be expected 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.900
 to make jumps very seals 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.580
 weird but otherwise it goes 6 the horse that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.940
 you ride is impatient and double everything 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.820
 the world 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.520
 are you afraid not at all I put it 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.140
 on a volt and I try to calm him down and 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.490
 I put it last and I do 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.620
 always flights to avoid taking 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.600
 the legs or so I slowed him down in 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.730
 straight line but if it's a horse 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.470
 really they really had suspect 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.880
 this void I put myself on a wave 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.010
 general it's a cable or always the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.100
 farm m6 apparently peanuts game but 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.690
 on a boot 7 a new element is 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.550
 found at the edge of the quarry and touches 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.410
 even a cease to make gaps as 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.880
 you scare 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.620
 if the horse makes big differences and 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.940
 who goes on asshole and who makes 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.880
 rodeo is all ears I'm going to be scared 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.590
 because I do not break my figure 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.240
 if it's a gap just a gap to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.400
 every time that will scare me but by 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.630
 against that annoys me and I wanted to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.860
 tend to annoy me to tell him but you 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.690
 see though it's a species branch 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.270
 stupid here and I'll try to 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.310
 push for it to go but 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.680
 usually that's usually it's 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.970
 like that I remember that from the young he 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.739
 has passed ten times in front of a bush and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.930
 then the 11th time he passed 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.230
 he farted a cable he was afraid of him 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:01.400
 his ambition, which had already seen more 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.870
 nice cities 8 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 a hot two-tone ball want that's 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.580
 that you have galloping and start to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.959
 heating and firing a super six and 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.030
 ballads I know I know where 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.640
 we're going to land and that knows them the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.989
 horse no I'm not afraid on the contrary if 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.549
 it's a totally unknown horse in 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.810
 a walk for example for you are 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.890
 gone on vacation and did not know 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.600
 the horse you know as long as you have to 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.950
 to go yeah I'm going to be scared because 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.710
 I do not know the reactions of the spl 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.340
 and I'm really repeating to drag 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.480
 to do it in one stroke is only nine at a gallop 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.760
 the horse in raids 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.980
 are you afraid if it's small florea 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.740
 in your street 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.480
 joy or so kicks because that 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.490
 annoys me to leave who is not used to 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.620
 to gallop well I'm not afraid 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.150
 but if the horse he goes on at street 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.040
 frenetic when even poetry she 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.260
 did to aim and go thoroughly and 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.110
 give huge ass shots and her 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.940
 end I was not afraid but I am 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.770
 fell once because of that and after 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.150
 I was a bit of a little bit more 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.500
 ready in apprehensive mode to leave at 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.330
 gallop and what did I know she 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 was going I knew she was going to lift the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.960
 hard ass and so that's when things of 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.280
 little sentences okay but when is this 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.040
 it's really big ass shots 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.120
 who says that with the kidney stroke yeah 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.800
 it's not very comfortable for me to say 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.890
 when you go to the club and you do not know 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.850
 not who you ride you're scared that it's been 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.020
 my biggest anti however everything 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.160
 while I was a kid every time 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.390
 janot saint tricat I had the ball 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.590
 in the belly we can say shit but who 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.850
 went back I hope I will not see 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.460
 my little heaps because nikita it was 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.870
 lipponen is super was super bad 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.070
 top box and she takes advantage completely 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.780
 when you were scared and I know 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.100
 to walk on 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.120
 and suddenly never limits I had 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.350
 want to vomit when I get better 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.870
 since I did not know who came back and 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.180
 I felt really bad 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.620
 and that's after growing up it's a 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.760
 little past but it's true it's 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.270
 this belly ball has always 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.070
 tend to stay 11 ton mono mounts the 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.490
 obstacle bar you have never before 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.590
 crossed this height do you fear ben 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.360
 for me who am a little fat too 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 big fat big jumping jack 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.570
 of obstacles yeah I think I have to 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.550
 apprehension I had a ball at 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.500
 belly but if it's roméo for example 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.780
 or a horse that I really know 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.670
 tell me good go I'll go there any 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.870
 way at worst we dropped it and we 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.810
 again we lower the bar and in 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.340
 come out here voila I tell myself that and 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.020
 it's true that since I joined 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.930
 since germain in half pension with I 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.520
 jump with him even if we go up the bars 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.260
 I feel that I have a little apprehension 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.129
 but I still push him to go 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.110
 what game 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:27.629
 whereas before it was impossible to me 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.009
 blow up gaulle and finally 12 12 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.139
 I challenge you to size and at least 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.080
 five people if you made this tag as 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.789
 you scared bah me I'm not scared in the 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.959
 meaning where do I have you have tags and five 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.339
 people but in the sense I know 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.949
 not always hair all in fact 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:47.379
 so we will cost college of my league 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:48.580
 I had you screaming zone and May 16 out of trouble 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:50.830
 and that does not look all my videos 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.269
 I believe in fact or so here is too much 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.469
 stuff to do or what so I do not think so
