00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello people, fine, I'm coming today. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 For you, a video, very quickly, just for 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.639
 explain to you about the color of my 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 hair as you probably know I 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.179
 I changed when my hair has little 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 time and I have received many many 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.190
 questions that you want to know that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.109
 I had used it and that schools families and etc. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.240
 So today I came to forget all this to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.160
 you first of all to those who do not 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 You did not know me before and I 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.039
 show you with my hair 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 I was before painting 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 so I 'm going to leave photos here for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 You'll see while I 'm going to talk soon. 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 before dyeing hair the root of my 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 hair is very different from the tips and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.500
 is with a very large piece of root 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 grown up that was very dark with only 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.040
 respond to a very different color from the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 product that I used at the tips of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.750
 my hair to leave that color at the time 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 this product was the frida city that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 he is a progressive bleacher he 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360
 will choose your hair gradually 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.890
 You'll use it and it will. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 choose the few 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.219
 I have a review of this product here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 there on the blog then I'll leave the link on 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.940
 enrollment box if you have 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.649
 interest at the time my hair stayed 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 much shorter I used this product 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.580
 my whole hair and it helped to give 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.439
 a light on it you can see 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.659
 picture of this whole process 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 in the review that I said there in the blog but 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 Obviously my hair roots started 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 to grow and I was letting her grow 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.979
 It was leaving you have to stay a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.290
 very large part difference 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.119
 used that product is a new part 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.650
 who had just grown up like you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.450
 You can see in this photo that I'm leaving here. 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.159
 so at the same time that I did not want to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 more stick with this super difference 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.000
 big hope my hair counts 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.409
 I was not dissatisfied with the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.329
 color that was on the ends of the hair 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.790
 because my hair he has a 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.579
 very strong tendency to pull towards the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.590
 orange and copper 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.540
 I do not particularly like that tone in the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 my hair so what happened was 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 how I used those dyes in the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.570
 My hair tips the tips started 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939
 to look more orange was appearing 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.229
 who had painted her red hair that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.180
 It was not my intention I just wanted 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 have left my hair a little brown 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.020
 a bit more clear because of course 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.430
 my brown hair is very dark 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 no way did i want to get angry 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.340
 because I think all the people but 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.170
 It was not what I wanted for my 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.969
 hair then the result I wanted 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.250
 in my hair was to take that 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 orange here for me was very ugly 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.459
 I was able to clear a bit more of my 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.450
 hair because I like it when he is 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.250
 a little clearer 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 I think it is now with a few more 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.300
 boxes and at the same time leave the ends 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.250
 of my hair a little lighter than 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.629
 that the root so what I did instead 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 to paint my hair at home because I 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.959
 particularly not for this I do not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.700
 I understand of hair coloring as 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.800
 deeply to simply paint the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.319
 hair at home and honestly all of them 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.450
 that I tried to do that I did 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.069
 You go here then to get the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.840
 result I wanted I was naturel 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.160
 clinic of curls I'm sure 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.260
 you know was long 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.940
 is probably a hall that has here in 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.959
 SÃ£o Paulo that specializes in hair 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 curly 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.890
 I cut my hair there a few months ago. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 back I'll leave the link to the video 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.340
 that is here in the channel of the cut of my 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.780
 hair here under the cofins inscription 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.220
 if you care 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 then as I had already cut my 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.489
 natural hair I really liked the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.560
 result I already have a confidence in the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.360
 professionals there and I said good I'll paint 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.340
 my hair there what they had to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.930
 did with my hair was with two 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.700
 things completely different was 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.680
 practically half a half sheet 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.360
 another one before all they had to 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.849
 just like my hair for him to stay 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.190
 one color only for this if I do not 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.880
 cheating and if I remember them well 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.700
 used color number 7.4 at the tips 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.350
 of my hair and 7.5 in the root that was where 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 was natural hair because 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.510
 theoretically extends it would act more more 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.799
 strong that it is already painted 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.630
 so as not to get stained them 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.769
 they used different just a little bit 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.540
 different right 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.739
 if I'm not mistaken, what they 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 used my hair was a 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.370
 Even though I'm going to try 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.109
 leave all the information here in the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.670
 box description and I will ask the 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.840
 hairdresser I'd rather have it sent 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.230
 I leave it all here in the registration form 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.420
 for you here but I think that 's it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.310
 7.4 in 7.5 in the root tips with 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.350
 the color wash away and then the result 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.359
 What got in my hair was the one from here. 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.430
 of this photo that you are still giving 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.579
 so I felt that my hair was 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.709
 orange but I feel like there's no way 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.989
 My hair pulls a lot orange. 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.760
 easily and the feeling I have is 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.349
 that if I wanted to go red, I would not go 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.700
 get a lot of people out there 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.440
 Who wants to go red today? 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.790
 especially now that it is also fashionable 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.400
 this business of having red hair 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.019
 Natural anodized natural then I still 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.489
 I felt that my hair had become 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.889
 mainly in the part of the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.919
 but at least it was not with the 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.040
 hair so different from root to tip and 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.470
 it was not so dark 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.360
 with the passing of days the toner was 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.340
 follows a little on the table getting less and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.290
 less orange which for me was a point 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.910
 super positive but how I still wanted 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.520
 that the ends of my hair would stay 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.710
 the clearer I went back into the hall and then they 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.510
 they did the ends of my hair 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.880
 the group that was the hairdresser who cares 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.620
 my hair tresses he did not finger 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.900
 He touched nothing he chose 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.460
 one little piece per piece to do 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.110
 because he said that it stays that way 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.060
 more natural, he can have a 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.740
 better control of where it gets clearer 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.080
 Where does it get darker than I wanted? 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 exactly just gives a cleared money 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.800
 in the accounts of my hair I did not want 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.690
 that you look at me if the blonde speaks 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.640
 I did not mean anything at all. 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.350
 wanted to give a little prominence to 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.240
 the ends of my hair I did not want 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.280
 that was very clear, I was too 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.990
 I did not want to get too many strands and 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.030
 for me it was exactly what Bruno 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.190
 did he was pulling the strands and he 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.720
 pulled more under the hair 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.550
 to be able to be more hidden here in 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.470
 down here in the bottom of the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.060
 my hair is a bit lighter and in 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.860
 front is more on the first rope 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.810
 painting that he used but still 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.580
 has some wicks that gives a lightening 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.190
 product that he used to make 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.290
 wicks in the hair is a product of l'orÃ©al 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.730
 which is called more wicks I also 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.630
 I'm going to leave a single male in the 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.280
 subscription 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.930
 What he told me is that this product 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.540
 he does not contain ammonia he showed me the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.280
 packaging really superlegal packaging 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.990
 is a product to whiten hair for 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.570
 discolor hair only that it reaches the ninth 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.010
 so obviously it gets much less 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.020
 children of course if you want 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.430
 your hair turns white discolored it 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.240
 You will not be able to choose your hair. 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.620
 so much so 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.120
 from what I saw on the packaging that Bruno 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.490
 showed me he can discolor the 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.900
 hair up to five shades but paton that I 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.700
 I wanted my hair stand up this 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.680
 product was perfect of course my 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.480
 hair was right that he was 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.250
 before but I already knew I already expected 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.570
 When are we going to paint our hair? 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.250
 discolor hair we have to 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.590
 know that your hair will stay longer 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.300
 resected because this is part but I 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.220
 definitely did not feel my hair 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.560
 was very respected what my 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.120
 curls became more difficult to define 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.860
 that they were more open than the 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.180
 texture of my hair has changed shape 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.930
 no he stayed a little longer 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.910
 resected 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.410
 but nothing that bothers anything that is not 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.410
 solve with good hydrations 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.900
 if you follow me here on the channel more 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.220
 time or if you saw my video about 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.290
 capillary schedule 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.300
 You know I did not have the habit of 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.790
 to use any protein product is the 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.170
 it china or arginine in none 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.090
 my hair because I did not feel that my 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.620
 hair to need but of course now 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.720
 that I tried my whole hair that 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.640
 I discovered a good part of it of mine. 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.530
 routine had to change a little bit more 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.480
 Nothing has changed the only thing 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.370
 that changed was that by including this 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.020
 Here is the product here in China. 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.210
 liquid that was max 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.520
 this product is released to new he 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.320
 contains hydrolyzed protein in my video 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.570
 on the capillary schedule I explained 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.950
 because it is important to use proteins 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.540
 hydrolysed hair 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.920
 several of you asked me that 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.020

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.060
