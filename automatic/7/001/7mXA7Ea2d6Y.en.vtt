00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
star-shaped ponds start on the number

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.330 
star-shaped ponds start on the number
one<00:00:32.029> spot<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.750> GarageBand<00:00:33.590> venue<00:00:34.010> where

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
one spot in the GarageBand venue where

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.130 
one spot in the GarageBand venue where
all<00:00:34.550> rock<00:00:34.820> stars<00:00:34.850> start<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.540> course<00:00:35.780> and

all rock stars start of course and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.780 
all rock stars start of course and
what's<00:00:36.800> really<00:00:36.980> cool<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.520> game

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
what's really cool is that the game

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.120 
what's really cool is that the game
board<00:00:38.090> is<00:00:38.300> not<00:00:38.660> only<00:00:38.840> guitar<00:00:39.080> shaped<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:39.890> it's

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
board is not only guitar shaped but it's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.760 
board is not only guitar shaped but it's
the<00:00:40.580> bottom<00:00:41.150> half<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.990> box<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:42.590> that's

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
the bottom half of the the box so that's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.470 
the bottom half of the the box so that's
very<00:00:42.920> cool<00:00:43.160> it's<00:00:43.340> an<00:00:43.430> all-inclusive<00:00:43.700> game

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
very cool it's an all-inclusive game

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.390 
very cool it's an all-inclusive game
so<00:00:44.930> basically<00:00:45.290> players<00:00:45.620> just<00:00:45.890> take<00:00:46.040> turns

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
so basically players just take turns

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.370 
so basically players just take turns
drawing<00:00:46.910> question<00:00:47.330> cards<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.080> if<00:00:48.170> you're<00:00:48.290> in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
drawing question cards so if you're in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.710 
drawing question cards so if you're in
the<00:00:48.500> Garage<00:00:48.740> Band<00:00:48.980> venue<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.520> draw<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.940> garage

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
the Garage Band venue you draw a garage

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.569 
the Garage Band venue you draw a garage
band<00:00:51.079> card<00:00:51.410> if<00:00:51.710> you're<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.040> other<00:00:52.160> venues

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
band card if you're in the other venues

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.190 
band card if you're in the other venues
you<00:00:52.730> draw<00:00:52.910> cards<00:00:53.270> from<00:00:53.450> those<00:00:53.630> respective

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
you draw cards from those respective

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.350 
you draw cards from those respective
venues<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:55.160> read<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.460> question<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.060> then<00:00:56.180> if

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
venues you read the question and then if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.850 
venues you read the question and then if
you<00:00:56.420> answer<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.840> correctly<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.320> can<00:00:57.470> move<00:00:57.650> to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
you answer it correctly you can move to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.660 
you answer it correctly you can move to
the<00:00:57.950> next<00:00:58.190> spot

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the next spot

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
the next spot
so<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:59.360> is<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.540> math<00:00:59.870> game<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.440> all<00:01:00.560> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
so this is a math game so all the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.229 
so this is a math game so all the
questions<00:01:00.800> are<00:01:01.220> going<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.370> be<00:01:01.520> math<00:01:01.700> problems

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
questions are going to be math problems

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.569 
questions are going to be math problems
and<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.540> one<00:01:02.780> says<00:01:03.020> your<00:01:03.680> band's<00:01:04.100> new<00:01:04.280> song
