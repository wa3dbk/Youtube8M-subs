00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
like normal and you pull it back through

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.500 
like normal and you pull it back through
just<00:00:53.739> like<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:53.920> Palomar<00:00:54.399> you<00:00:54.640> have<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:55.390> know

this<00:00:55.809> thing<00:00:56.020> sliding<00:00:56.590> just<00:00:56.829> like<00:00:57.040> you<00:00:57.219> would<00:00:57.489> a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
this thing sliding just like you would a

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.200

Palomar<00:00:58.149> knot<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:59.710> this<00:01:00.460> knot<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:01.000> goes

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
Palomar knot into this knot it goes

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.910 
Palomar knot into this knot it goes
through<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.510> eyelet<00:01:01.809> twice<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.290> do<00:01:02.410> not<00:01:02.680> tie<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.979 
through the eyelet twice I do not tie a
knot<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.969> line<00:01:04.149> does<00:01:04.449> not<00:01:04.629> go<00:01:04.780> through

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.620 

about<00:01:41.080> four<00:01:41.350> or<00:01:41.380> five<00:01:41.650> times<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:43.120> found<00:01:43.390> to

about four or five times I have found to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.860 
about four or five times I have found to
be<00:01:43.780> perfect<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.940> could<00:01:46.120> go<00:01:46.270> more<00:01:46.480> if<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.690> want

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
I guess but at least four times so I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.000 
I guess but at least four times so I
want<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.720> wrap<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.110> down<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.680> I'm<00:01:50.800> wrapping

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
want to wrap that down so I'm wrapping

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.460 
want to wrap that down so I'm wrapping
it<00:01:51.250> down<00:01:51.490> towards<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> eye<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.750> hook<00:01:52.900> so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
it down towards the eye of the hook so

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.140 
it down towards the eye of the hook so
this<00:01:53.800> up<00:01:54.010> here<00:01:54.220> in<00:01:54.310> my<00:01:54.400> left<00:01:54.610> hand<00:01:54.910> where<00:01:55.120> I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
this up here in my left hand where I

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.300 
this up here in my left hand where I
have<00:01:55.300> I've<00:01:55.570> pinched<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.500> very<00:01:56.770> important

have I've pinched it's very important
you<00:01:57.460> want<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.700> hang<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.330> after<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.170> go

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
you want to hang on to that after I go

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.120 
you want to hang on to that after I go
down<00:01:59.710> around<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.310> four<00:02:00.610> times<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.180> take<00:02:01.510> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
down around that four times I take this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640 
down around that four times I take this
loop<00:02:03.130> I've<00:02:03.340> created<00:02:03.610> here<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:05.110> want<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.440> go

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
loop I've created here and I want to go

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.120 
loop I've created here and I want to go
through<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.630> loop<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.170> pinched<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.890> go

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
through the loop that I pinched you go

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.430 
through the loop that I pinched you go
through<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:10.000> loop<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.750> created<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
through that loop that you created so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.050 
through that loop that you created so
you're<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.980> through<00:02:12.220> two<00:02:12.520> loops<00:02:12.760> you're

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you're going through two loops you're

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.600 
you're going through two loops you're
going<00:02:13.270> through<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.630> one<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.650> so

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
going through this one and this one so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.740 
going through this one and this one so
you<00:02:15.670> grab<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:17.500> kind<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.830> pull

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you grab that and you kind of pull

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.990 
you grab that and you kind of pull
that'll<00:02:19.750> kind<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.020> stay<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.130> now<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.670> want

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
that'll kind of stay there so now I want

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.670 
that'll kind of stay there so now I want
to<00:02:22.090> pull<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.540> mainline<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.410> going

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
to pull the mainline that's going

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
to pull the mainline that's going
through<00:02:23.709> my<00:02:23.920> rod<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:25.030> tag<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.570> and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
through my rod and the tag in and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.680 
through my rod and the tag in and
that'll<00:02:26.560> cinch<00:02:26.860> that'<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.310> obviously<00:02:28.090> with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
that'll cinch that' and obviously with

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.180 
that'll cinch that' and obviously with
any<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.380> know<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:29.770> moistening<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
any not you know just moistening a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.690 
any not you know just moistening a
little<00:02:30.400> bit

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
little bit

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.310 
little bit
you<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.209> your<00:02:31.330> mainline<00:02:31.510> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.020> your<00:02:32.170> rod

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
you have your mainline going to your rod

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.500 
you have your mainline going to your rod
and<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:32.830> you've<00:02:32.950> got<00:02:33.160> three<00:02:33.640> tag<00:02:33.880> ins<00:02:34.150> you've

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
and then you've got three tag ins you've

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.840 
and then you've got three tag ins you've
got<00:02:34.690> your<00:02:34.870> loop<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.620> tag<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.730> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
got your loop and this tag in and you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.970 
got your loop and this tag in and you
just<00:02:36.880> want<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.150> cut<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.450> off<00:02:37.510> how<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.739> knot

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
just want to cut that off how this knot

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.680 
just want to cut that off how this knot
works<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.510> never<00:02:41.640> cinches<00:02:42.640> down<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.180> top<00:02:43.660> of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
works is it never cinches down on top of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.949 
works is it never cinches down on top of
itself<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.739> never<00:02:45.340> pulls<00:02:45.700> down<00:02:45.940> tight<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
itself it never pulls down tight and you

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.199 
itself it never pulls down tight and you
will<00:02:47.140> find<00:02:47.410> when<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.459> tight<00:02:48.730> with<00:02:49.000> your

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
will find when you tight with your

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.890 
will find when you tight with your
regular<00:02:49.480> line<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.980> pull<00:02:51.220> this

regular line that when you pull this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.509 
regular line that when you pull this
you've<00:02:52.900> tied<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.290> properly<00:02:53.680> when<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.370> you

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
you've tied it properly when you if you

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.550 
you've tied it properly when you if you
pull<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.880> loop<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.510> knot<00:02:55.690> comes<00:02:55.959> it'll

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
pull this loop and the knot comes it'll

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.350 
pull this loop and the knot comes it'll
it'll<00:02:56.799> slide<00:02:57.100> back<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.370> it'll<00:02:57.820> come<00:02:58.030> undone

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
it'll slide back up it'll come undone

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.300 
it'll slide back up it'll come undone
but<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.440> know<00:02:59.530> pull<00:02:59.830> this<00:02:59.980> and

but you just you know pull this and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.910 
but you just you know pull this and
tighten<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.670> back<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.030> no<00:03:01.420> big<00:03:01.660> deal<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.049> found
