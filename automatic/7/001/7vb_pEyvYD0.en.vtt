00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bead and a more flat bead obviously it's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.109 
bead and a more flat bead obviously it's
just<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.900> that

say<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.340> don't<00:02:05.340> worry<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.790> making

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
say to people don't worry about making

say to people don't worry about making
the<00:02:06.329> loops<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.110> tiny<00:02:07.470> or<00:02:08.069> two<00:02:08.369> perfectly<00:02:08.849> round

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the loops to tiny or two perfectly round

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.089 
the loops to tiny or two perfectly round
as<00:02:09.840> long<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.590> come<00:02:10.739> back<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
as long as they actually come back to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.680 
as long as they actually come back to
themselves<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> touch<00:02:12.120> back<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.540> themselves

themselves and touch back on themselves
so<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> they're<00:02:13.770> not<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.099> come<00:02:14.280> undone

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so that they're not going to come undone

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
so that they're not going to come undone
that's<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> important<00:02:16.080> thing<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.870> just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that's the important thing and you just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
that's the important thing and you just
keep<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:20.160> long<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.700> want

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
keep going with this as long as you want

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.650 
keep going with this as long as you want
it<00:02:22.640> now<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> very<00:02:24.569> long

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
it now if it's going to be a very long

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.300 
it now if it's going to be a very long
necklace<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.620> over<00:02:25.739> your<00:02:25.950> head<00:02:26.099> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
necklace it can go over your head you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
necklace it can go over your head you
don't<00:02:26.489> need<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.819> worry<00:02:26.849> about<00:02:27.120> adding<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.720> class

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
don't need to worry about adding a class

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.050 
don't need to worry about adding a class
I'm<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> show<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.190> how<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.489> can<00:02:29.849> add<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
I'm going to show you how you can add a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
I'm going to show you how you can add a
class<00:02:30.330> though<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.500> want<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.769> shorter

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
class though for if you want a shorter

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.640 
class though for if you want a shorter
one<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.630> I'll<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.230> bead<00:02:34.440> on

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
one but so I'll put one more bead on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.460 
one but so I'll put one more bead on
here

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.950 

it<00:02:42.070> doesn't<00:02:42.640> want<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.850> go<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:43.330> there<00:02:43.870> we

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
it doesn't want to go that one there we

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.930 
it doesn't want to go that one there we
go<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.760> again<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.120> bend<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.480> over<00:02:47.760> cut<00:02:48.760> off

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
go so again it's bend it over cut off

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.180 
go so again it's bend it over cut off
the<00:02:49.060> excess<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.460> make<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.490> loop<00:02:52.410> okay<00:02:53.410> as<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.070> say

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
the excess and make a loop okay as I say

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.890 
the excess and make a loop okay as I say
once<00:02:54.370> you've<00:02:54.520> got<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.730> long<00:02:54.880> enough<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.750> can

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
once you've got it long enough you can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.160 
once you've got it long enough you can
add<00:02:56.110> your<00:02:56.290> clasp<00:02:56.590> I'm<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.520> using<00:02:57.870> oops<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
add your clasp I'm just using oops a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.150 
add your clasp I'm just using oops a
simple<00:03:00.130> toggle<00:03:00.460> clasp<00:03:00.850> here<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:03.040> you

need<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.460> do<00:03:03.640> your<00:03:04.390> last<00:03:04.600> loop<00:03:05.280> before<00:03:06.280> you

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
need to do your last loop before you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.530 
need to do your last loop before you
close<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.850> up<00:03:07.120> completely<00:03:08.970> put<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.150> part<00:03:10.420> of

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.680 

and<00:03:17.230> close<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.710> loop<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.450> on<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.600> other

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
and close up the loop then on the other

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:29.300 
and close up the loop then on the other
