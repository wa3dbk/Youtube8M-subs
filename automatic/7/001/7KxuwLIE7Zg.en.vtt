00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.680
 they asked us today to talk about the 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.709
 theme of the walkmans and their use in 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.650
 young people and teenagers especially 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.990
 although adults also use it from 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.420
 that electronic equipment for the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.750
 audition of music have been made more 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 small has been more accessible the price 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.260
 to buy equipment that allows 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 perform walking and running movements 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.469
 take over some jobs music 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.710
 this has been seen with the running of 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.019
 time you have risks and those risks 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 are the ones we're going to talk about this 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.520
 tomorrow at this time 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.270
 when you listen to music you should listen 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.010
 always music at an intensity 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.810
 comfortable is to say you should not look in the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.720
 made of hearing the music 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.050
 added effects that is what the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.920
 young people to put very strong the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.140
 Walkman and look for sensations 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.380
 basically of vibratory type in 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.090
 hearing that makes listening to 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.740
 a great intensity 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.220
 the walkman the noise so intense 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.240
 generates in the inner ear a 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.550
 destruction of the ear cells of 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.820
 the cutting device and that's going to lead to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.350
 a hypoacusis absolutely 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.170
 irreversible of acute pure tones 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.200
 of the audio gram this has 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.060
 exclusively one way and that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 path is to edit the intense sounds in 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 the audition of the walkmans and when 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.190
 we know that the person is 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.970
 listening to high intensities if I 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.940
 I walk down the street for example and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.209
 I hear that someone with walkman gives me his 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.910
 music that means that the one that is 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.890
 using is using them at an intensity 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.959
 very high and it is destroying your ear 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.000
 so many times I stop people in 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.550
 the street and I let you know these 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 concepts to try to be 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.730
 alert and avoid the destruction of your 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.720
 heard I reiterate the importance of this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.569
 block is commenting on the fact of the injury 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 irreversible is to say that within the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.780
 medical field there is no 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.349
 medication no surgical maneuver 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.130
 to make the destroyed thing return to the ear 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.360
 by hearing a lot of intensity 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.760
 this makes it necessary within 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.190
 all youth to hear this 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.560
 type of programs especially to 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.590
 parents who buy bockmann their boys 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.830
 to be explained to them 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.970
 understand that there is the possibility of 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.370
 enjoy music at intensities 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.160
 absolutely comfortable without necessity 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.590
 to put them so so intensely 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.020
 this happens exactly as with the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.480
 strong noise from the industry that 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.990
 destroy those who do not wear protectors 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.270
 auditory your inner ear for it 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.760
 we want to take the spirit to 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.340
 understanding of all those who are 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.120
 responsible for this situation that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.360
 avoid listening to music at high 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.910
 intensities this is achieved in certain 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.660
 modern equipment that have what 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.990
 it's called an intensity limit of 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.810
 sound and allows there to be a cut of 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.030
 the same when it exceeds a large 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.580
 intensity 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.010
 I reiterate then try as much as possible 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.190
 do not avoid if someone likes the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.170
 music that listens to what you want but what 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.380
 that we have to try to make understand 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.200
 is that the intensity of the sound should be 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.560
 comfortable enough to 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.500
 listen to the music and that there is not 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.190
 of the action of the inner ear an injury 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.470
 that it is absolutely intractable 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.450
 with the conventional methods that 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.800
 any doctor can have in his 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.200
 office or in the operating room is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.169
 important all this so that you follow 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.350
 enjoying the music and we 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:45.010
 let's put this situation on the air for 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.010
 take absolutely preventive measures
