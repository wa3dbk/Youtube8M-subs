anyway you know just innovating and and
taking<00:03:48.550> what<00:03:48.730> we<00:03:48.880> thought<00:03:49.180> was<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.810> limit<00:03:50.320> of

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
taking what we thought was the limit of

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.650 
taking what we thought was the limit of
height<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.190> spinning<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.700> stuff<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.390> taking

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
height and spinning and stuff and taking

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.780 
height and spinning and stuff and taking
it<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.930> whole<00:03:53.020> new<00:03:53.200> level<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.790> merkins<00:03:55.780> Oz<00:03:55.960> I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
it to a whole new level and merkins Oz I

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.520 
it to a whole new level and merkins Oz I
just<00:03:57.790> I've<00:03:57.970> been<00:03:58.120> skating<00:03:58.570> for<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.900> long<00:03:59.140> that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
just I've been skating for so long that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.610 
just I've been skating for so long that
I<00:04:00.010> was<00:04:00.790> never<00:04:01.180> trying<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.630> covet<00:04:01.960> it<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.500> know

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
I was never trying to covet it you know

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.960 
I was never trying to covet it you know
I<00:04:02.650> mean<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.980> always<00:04:03.010> thought<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.760> there

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
I mean I always thought that there

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.100 
I mean I always thought that there
should<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.180> bigger<00:04:04.390> audience<00:04:04.570> for<00:04:04.960> it<00:04:05.050> I

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
should be a bigger audience for it I

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.000 
should be a bigger audience for it I
thought<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.500> more<00:04:05.710> people<00:04:05.830> should

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
thought that more people should

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.530 
thought that more people should
appreciate<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.550> never<00:04:06.730> understood<00:04:07.330> why<00:04:07.510> it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
appreciate I never understood why it

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.680 
appreciate I never understood why it
