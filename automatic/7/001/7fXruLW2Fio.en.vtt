00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
about how you lift it so this is our

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.429 
about how you lift it so this is our
barbell<00:00:26.250> bench<00:00:26.820> press<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.750> chest<00:00:28.050> done

barbell bench press for chest done

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
barbell bench press for chest done
properly<00:00:29.010> okay<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> regular

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
properly okay we don't have a regular

properly okay we don't have a regular
barbell<00:00:31.170> bench<00:00:31.410> press<00:00:31.550> rack<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.300> it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
barbell bench press rack here so it's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.180 
barbell bench press rack here so it's
gonna<00:00:33.630> look<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.110> funny<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.829> me<00:00:34.920> getting

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gonna look a little funny for me getting

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
gonna look a little funny for me getting
into<00:00:35.370> position<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.000> hopefully<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.750> you're

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
into position but hopefully if you're

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.240 
into position but hopefully if you're
already<00:00:37.200> doing<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> barbell<00:00:37.980> bench<00:00:38.160> press

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
already doing the barbell bench press

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
already doing the barbell bench press
that<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> regular<00:00:39.480> barbell<00:00:39.840> bench

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that you got a regular barbell bench

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.430 
that you got a regular barbell bench
rack<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> key<00:00:42.270> issues<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
rack so one of the key issues is that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.819 
rack so one of the key issues is that
people<00:00:43.739> grab<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.399> bar<00:00:44.550> too<00:00:44.789> wide<00:00:45.559> I'm<00:00:46.559> about

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
people grab the bar too wide I'm about

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
people grab the bar too wide I'm about
five<00:00:47.100> ten<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.879> average<00:00:48.000> length<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> arms

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
five ten I got an average length of arms

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250 
five ten I got an average length of arms
and<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.690> outside

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and I go just a little bit right outside

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
and I go just a little bit right outside
that<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.980> line<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> bar<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.000> so

that that line in the bar right there so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
that that line in the bar right there so
it's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.690> inside<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.289> 90<00:00:55.920> degree

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's a little bit inside a 90 degree

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.990 
it's a little bit inside a 90 degree
angle<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:56.610> elbows<00:00:56.940> okay<00:01:01.789> that's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> nice

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
angle in my elbows okay that's a nice

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.340 
angle in my elbows okay that's a nice
app<00:01:03.300> technique<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> laying

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
app technique right there and laying

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
app technique right there and laying
down<00:01:04.409> slow<00:01:04.739> without<00:01:05.010> weight<00:01:05.250> okay<00:01:05.880> now<00:01:06.299> here's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
down slow without weight okay now here's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
down slow without weight okay now here's
the<00:01:06.630> key<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> people<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.439> bench<00:01:07.650> press

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the key a lot of people will bench press

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
the key a lot of people will bench press
down<00:01:09.409> because<00:01:10.409> they're<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> concerned<00:01:11.040> with

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
down because they're just concerned with

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.260 
down because they're just concerned with
how<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.340> weight<00:01:11.580> through<00:01:11.729> lifting<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
how much weight through lifting and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.940 
how much weight through lifting and
their<00:01:12.720> legs<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.080> sort<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.830> we

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
got to get a really solid base of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.399 
got to get a really solid base of
support<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:15.600> bringing<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.930> feet<00:01:16.140> back

chest properly so that you can just

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.319 
chest properly so that you can just
allow<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> chest<00:02:50.980> muscles<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.639> work<00:02:51.819> more

it starts to warm up that capsule a
little<00:04:20.079> bit<00:04:20.199> so<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.889> when<00:04:21.039> we<00:04:21.190> get<00:04:21.340> rather

safer and it also starts to get some

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.230 
safer and it also starts to get some
blood<00:04:27.590> flow<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:28.010> there<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.340> blood<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.120> the

blood flow in there and blood is the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.820 
blood flow in there and blood is the
river<00:04:29.419> of<00:04:29.570> life<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.930> really<00:04:30.110> starts<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.590> heal
