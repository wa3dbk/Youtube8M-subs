00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
subsistence that's where I became a

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.829 
subsistence that's where I became a
human<00:01:03.309> ecologist<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.360> actually<00:01:04.719> the

I've developed along the way with some

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.649 
I've developed along the way with some
excellent<00:01:09.069> graduate<00:01:09.369> students<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.179> concept

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
excellent graduate students the concept

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.690 
second Eureka moment
it<00:01:15.700> came<00:01:15.969> when<00:01:16.749> or<00:01:17.619> just<00:01:17.950> after<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.340> had<00:01:18.549> been

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
wasn't that familiar with it so I felt

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.139 
wasn't that familiar with it so I felt

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
like a bit of a fool and here was a very

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.999 
like a bit of a fool and here was a very

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
cogent argument from his point of view

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.429 
cogent argument from his point of view
that<00:02:00.489> humans<00:02:00.880> had<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.209> capacity<00:02:01.389> to<00:02:01.840> liberate

I was a young wet-behind-the-ears PhD at
the<00:02:07.359> time<00:02:07.689> so<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.349> was<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.679> bit<00:02:08.860> chastened<00:02:09.569> but

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the time so I was a bit chastened but

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.620

when I got a new computer I had been

calling this estimate something like the

I<00:04:06.760> happen<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.360> working<00:04:07.480> on<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.840> first

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
I happen to be working on the first

and<00:04:11.250> calling<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.340> something<00:04:12.730> else<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.270> he

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
and calling it something else and he

and calling it something else and he
asked<00:04:13.630> me<00:04:13.720> how<00:04:13.840> do<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:13.959> like<00:04:14.140> your<00:04:14.320> new

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
asked me how do you like your new

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.680 
asked me how do you like your new
machine<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:15.130> said<00:04:15.459> it's<00:04:15.610> terrific<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.420> has<00:04:16.660> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
machine I said it's terrific it has a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.170 
machine I said it's terrific it has a
much<00:04:16.930> smaller<00:04:17.109> footprint<00:04:18.040> on<00:04:18.280> my<00:04:18.670> desk<00:04:18.910> I've

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
much smaller footprint on my desk I've

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.240 
much smaller footprint on my desk I've
gone<00:04:19.330> from<00:04:19.570> these<00:04:19.870> big<00:04:20.109> flat<00:04:20.380> things<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.950> it

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
gone from these big flat things to it

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.750 
gone from these big flat things to it
smaller<00:04:21.519> cocktail<00:04:22.180> remodel<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.350> 1989<00:04:24.340> or

smaller cocktail remodel this is 1989 or

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.690 
smaller cocktail remodel this is 1989 or
1990<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.920> immediately<00:04:26.920> as<00:04:27.070> soon<00:04:27.250> as<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.520> said

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
1990 and immediately as soon as I said

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.580 
1990 and immediately as soon as I said
the<00:04:27.730> word<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.150> has<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.300> smaller<00:04:28.750> footprint<00:04:29.320> I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
the word it has a smaller footprint I

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.860 
the word it has a smaller footprint I
realized<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.400> was<00:04:30.550> writing<00:04:30.790> about<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.420> human

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
realized I was writing about the human

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.020 
realized I was writing about the human
ecological<00:04:32.770> footprint<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.400> threw<00:04:33.970> that

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
ecological footprint so I threw that

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.990 
ecological footprint so I threw that
paper<00:04:34.390> I<00:04:34.810> changed<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.860> whatever<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.790> was<00:04:36.970> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
paper I changed the whatever it was I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.030 
paper I changed the whatever it was I
was<00:04:37.240> calling<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.720> at<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.930> time<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.410> human

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
was calling it at the time to human

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.340 
was calling it at the time to human
ecological<00:04:39.220> footprint<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.900> was<00:04:41.140> that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
ecological footprint and it was that

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.500 
ecological footprint and it was that
metaphor<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.340> think<00:04:42.640> gave<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.030> idea<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
metaphor that I think gave the idea the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.790 
metaphor that I think gave the idea the
power<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.990> move<00:04:44.140> forward

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
power to move forward

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.310 
power to move forward
so<00:04:45.160> three<00:04:45.520> Eureka<00:04:46.060> moments<00:04:46.480> one<00:04:46.720> at<00:04:46.840> ten<00:04:47.080> years

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
so three Eureka moments one at ten years

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.920 
so three Eureka moments one at ten years
old<00:04:47.560> one<00:04:47.920> you<00:04:48.430> know<00:04:48.550> 15<00:04:49.120> years<00:04:49.150> later<00:04:49.630> when<00:04:49.900> I

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
old one you know 15 years later when I

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.990

was<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> young<00:04:50.650> PhD<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.400> then<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.580> couple<00:04:51.760> years

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
was a young PhD and then a couple years

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.570 
was a young PhD and then a couple years
after<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.390> then<00:04:52.780> well<00:04:53.650> no<00:04:53.770> it's<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.040> good<00:04:54.160> 15

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
after that then well no it's a good 15
