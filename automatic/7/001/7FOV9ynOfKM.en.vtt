00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.860
 a lot of twine would have a company know 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.399
 a transportation company that will be called 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.399

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.780
 just to see how it was and I arrived and not 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.579

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 very naive know when it happened to me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 when a moment my parents presented 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 They told me Federico we have to tell you 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.519

 the money comes from mom's lover 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.110
 in courts and a modest life 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.239

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.980
 and in courts a very nice building 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.960

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 building as well as the building of sin 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.450
 the people who go up and receive up are 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 they listen to the afternoon screams the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.960
 fees the boys can not 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.000
 work like this 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.440
 I have a very modest bank account 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.659
 also the very modest bank account and 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.549
 they meditate many things in the bank 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.860
 permanently and sometimes it gets to have 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 reds well of 100 pesos not much and neither 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.020
 calling the bank to claim the debt 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.490
 that marry trust a bank that

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.710

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.180
 I live with a good cat cat my 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.920
 old man when I brought the cat my daughter 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.570
 said federico look does not suit you to have 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 pets because you love them and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.810
 then they die and I am that program with 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.600
 that criterion is also not appropriate 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 parents 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.500
 what I want is like this if I have 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 so I have 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.630
 very old very bad the car in fact 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.340
 broke me with a donkey's back in order 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.570
 also the songs are those things that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.570
 There is between donkey loin and donkey loin 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.569
 Northeastern is icons in order that they are 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.879
 countries inside of another song and 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.879
 generals with a music of can trinity 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.630
 and I remember that it breaks down there and what 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.980
 I take the mechanic permanently with the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.780
 mechanic passed a very strange situation 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.730
 which is that the mechanic feels in the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.680
 obligation to tell you everything that is going 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.660
 to the car and I do not care 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.220
 because I do not know anything about mechanics then 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.170
 but I have to pretend that I'm interested 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.569
 because I get distracted as you type 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.730
 I send an arrangement of the commands to save 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.650
 the guy speaks to you he understood 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 I repeat you word habit is the rotor it 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.280
 rotor all 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.110
 but as the quote expresses that same 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.819
 quote that if you really like the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.409
 person with whom you have an appointment was 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.060
 friend talks to you she likes you're thinking 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.379
 is clear inside as a journalist 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.379
 sporty solar bed vite 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.650
 and if you do not like it 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.989
 and if you do not like it the other way around if you do not like it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.250
 even that you talk and you do not like what 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.790
 is saying are you thinking a man 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.690
 is going down but they never kissed 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.690
 someone to shut up 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.580
 sweden the mechanic 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.700
 our good to finish I'll talk 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.739
 of what he suffered so quickly seen 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.420
 they know the subject of what they accuse you of 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.459
 dealer and all that seems to me I was 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.900
 a cohabitation at a time happened to me 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.450
 that the libido went away from food 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.800
 buy cigarettes fano government 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.050
 and I think that humanity would be a debate 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.269
 deep on how to hold libido with 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.410
 the same person over time to 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.330
 Sometimes I think that marriage is like 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.879
 a medieval institution pull out of a 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.709
 epoch that a type of casabona 20s of 15 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.090
 have a few children of politicians and 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.700
 paris was going to a war I went back eight years 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.069
 then in the 35 the palms go everything and 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.630
 if you're going to marry at 20 with someone and 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.630
 you read with the average day that is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.470
 with me people 50 years the hypothesis is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.840
 marriage was killed by medicine 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.840
 and so many times
