00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.080
 Now we will check how it behaves 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.170
 fuel combustion catalyst papst cars 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.149
 getting into the fuel tank 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.119
 by which 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.729
 there is a mandate 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.139
 very often happens in morocco that ours 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.579
 fuel tanks 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.960
 and I am accumulating water the other day 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.919
 conducts in advance prepared 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.769
 bottle where do you see 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.769
 15 percent 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 see yes 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.630
 we are now on trial 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.230
 that is, is it correct 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.230
 and mayor just 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 habit square 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.730
 we put such a point 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 sony not yet 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.330
 so that the processing of the offender in the opinion 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.730
 at 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730
 it will all be done it remains 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.200
 in this case 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 you will see what miracle happens 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 the tablet does not sink 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 fuel combustion catalyst and two players 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 psv 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 no then no 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.630
 he is swimming 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 which means Levitin that he began to dissolve 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
 see yes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 here gasoline starts to acquire 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.260
 sea ​​wave 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 so blue but green blue 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.809
 and let's try 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 chattering a bottle 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.429
 what will be in honor 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 catalyst drowned 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.929
 she tries to come up again 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.399
 and it continues to dissolve 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.249
 he surfaced 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.049
 we deliberately drowned of course 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.049
 percentage of such whirlpools 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.469
 gasoline gate 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.349
 the fuel tank will not what situation 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.909
 we have now created 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.849
 and yet after that he managed 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.329
 surface and continues until 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.899
 calmly dissolve 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.139
 which means that the catalyst 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.139
 burning fuel and navara papst 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.979
 not afraid of water tanks 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.939
 that was the point 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 our experience today 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.259
 of course the dissolution premium 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.099
 for sure 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.649
 will increase 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.759
 here it is 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.759
 I think more of these 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519
 doesn't usually happen in the car 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.419
 see how small tucson has become 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.289
 dissolves without problems 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.169
 and here are the sweepstakes of others 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.139
 company as far as I know 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.469
 getting a water tank 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.469
 never dissolve 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.939
 use catalysts 2 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:43.999
 rotation 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.439
 and you will be satisfied 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.079
 and your car will thank you
