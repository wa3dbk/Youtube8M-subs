00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.059
 oh i am willem from example point soon 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.910
 and in the next video lesson 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 let's look at subtraction from 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.279
 bigger number if you go numbers 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 subtracting from each other then you always come 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.090
 butcher oldest my source and a trick 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.890
 in addition, that is you anyway 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:38.570
 can work with it online 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.570
 7 8 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 tim and I'm going to do pieces 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.579
 1011 you send 12 13 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 that is far enough fast 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.000
 I now have the simple sum and I will 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 also shows you that number line 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.530
 imagine I have a simple sun 12 min 4 then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 can i start at 12 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 and one two three four steps back 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:31.049
 this could have had or I would suggest the sun 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:39.119
 have 5 min 3 and 7 5 high one two three 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 step back and I will come to two 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.909
 does this is the basis of subtraction 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.280
 only if you do that with larger numbers 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.159
 are going to do then some small fast ones 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.979
 details 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.810
 making fun with small ones 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:09.080
 quick details I mean 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 suppose we have the sun 138 more in our own 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.569
 you can do your house head then you can 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.069
 1 time of course also say as 139 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:22.200
 but I just go into something else 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.730
 write notation I write below 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 each other and now look at 8 min 9 then 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.220
 that will not be negative numbers 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.580
 yes it can but on this 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.670
 give voice level 8 min 9 that is only possible 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.670
 can is for world 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:59.280
 18 min 9 or even 38 min 9 if necessary 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:03.060
 38 minus 9 is 7 steps back about 9 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.409
 steps back from 38 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.409
 so that's 29 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.239
 then what i do is the 29 i got for you 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.239
 view 9 of them 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.510
 and of these three you make two 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.530
 well 2 min x is and remains two 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.440
 a mix remains one so now I have this 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.440
 simple sun already solved 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.470
 the trick you think for larger numbers 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.569
 exactly the same 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.730
 I suppose I do what my 5 million 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:55.909
 636 229 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.909
 min 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:12.560
 in 86 1128 it is great at the same time 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:20.470
 much the same but it is again 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:26.300
 doing fast 9 min 8 is 1 4 min 2 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:28.900
 2 2 min 1 is 1 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.900
 christmas is 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.580
 is nothing zero three minus 8 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.300
 that is not possible 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.300
 63 min 8 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.580
 I can do that is 55 so then 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:05:00.230
 write 4 and 5 holes 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:05.030
 this six becomes five five and minus x 5 and 5 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.820
 minutes is 5 again 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.220
 so that I also have this more difficult 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.580
 also managed 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.700
 here was just one more time 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.090
 that strange change in that we have one 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.450
 We had to change 6 to five 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.490
 now do it again and now I grab two 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.140
 numbers that anyway 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.940
 are problematic for me down there 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.220
 to pull 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.990
 because the numbers I could use 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.990
 very annoying 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:54.470
 namely silent I bank 120,600 30 and there 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:59.920
 I pull from 158 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.920
 2 or 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.390
 1582 to be deducted from this 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:16.030
 there is again 0 min 2 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:16.030
 can do something 10 min 2 can sometimes 8 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:25.100
 if of course i have to say 30 min 2 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:31.910
 is 28 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:38.980
 so 28 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.980
 2 min 8 may also, but does not 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:49.700
 62 min 8 is just thinking for yourself 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:59.930
 54 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:07:11.740
 so here comes these six loops 5 5 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:11.740
 min 5 is 0 0 , something can be 20 min 1 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:23.900
 19 that is possible 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:31.240
 so 20 min 1 is 9 10 so 911 minix oh 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:31.240
 that is just that is 1 and 1 minus x is 1 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:42.010
 so these two numbers are deducted higher 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.010
 delivers to under 19 1048 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.870
 this is the basis for deduction on 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:51.140
 provided the outcome is positive 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.850
 will continue in a next video 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.720
 start looking at negative numbers and 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:58.310
 how we subtract works to negative 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.910
 numbers come true 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.910
 thanks for looking
