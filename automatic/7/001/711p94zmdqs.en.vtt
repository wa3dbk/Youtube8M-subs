sensitive<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.520> carbs<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.060> wouldn't<00:01:54.570> really

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sensitive to carbs I wouldn't really

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
sensitive to carbs I wouldn't really
recommend<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:56.149> how<00:01:57.149> close<00:01:57.479> should<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
recommend doing it how close should you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
recommend doing it how close should you
be<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.140> macros<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> hitting<00:01:59.040> the

right<00:01:59.280> amount<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> calories<00:02:00.090> important

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
right amount of calories important

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170 
right amount of calories important
that's<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.890> personal<00:02:02.340> preference<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.940> think

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that's all personal preference I think

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.970 
that's all personal preference I think
hitting<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.600> macronutrient<00:02:04.440> goals<00:02:04.650> might

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
hitting your macronutrient goals might

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.190 
hitting your macronutrient goals might
be<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.180> precise<00:02:06.720> if<00:02:07.020> that's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
be a little bit more precise if that's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600 
be a little bit more precise if that's
what<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.440> looking<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.160> you're

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
what you're looking to do if you're

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.219 
what you're looking to do if you're
looking<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> gain<00:02:09.300> weight<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.690> lose<00:02:09.750> weight

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
looking to gain weight or lose weight

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
looking to gain weight or lose weight
and<00:02:10.410> simply<00:02:11.130> don't<00:02:11.310> care<00:02:11.370> whether<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.910> fat

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and simply don't care whether it's fat

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.270 
and simply don't care whether it's fat
muscle<00:02:12.450> anything<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.920> calorie

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
muscle anything like that the calorie

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.770 
muscle anything like that the calorie
numbers<00:02:14.610> what's<00:02:14.790> important<00:02:15.240> how<00:02:15.390> big<00:02:15.630> your

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
numbers what's important how big your

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.140 
numbers what's important how big your
deficit<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.290> surplus<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> think

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
deficit or surplus is but I think

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.699 
deficit or surplus is but I think
hitting<00:02:18.300> your<00:02:18.480> macro<00:02:18.810> nutrient<00:02:19.260> targets

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
hitting your macro nutrient targets

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.120 
hitting your macro nutrient targets
would<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.220> more<00:02:20.730> specific<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
would be more specific and I think it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.500 
would be more specific and I think it
gives<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.400> better<00:02:23.490> breakdown<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.360> you're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
gives a better breakdown of what you're

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.440 
gives a better breakdown of what you're
actually<00:02:24.660> taking<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> day<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:27.330> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
actually taking in for the day what is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
actually taking in for the day what is
your<00:02:27.540> favorite<00:02:27.870> music<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.410> train<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.060> really

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
your favorite music to train to really

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.820 
your favorite music to train to really
anything<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> gym<00:02:30.990> music<00:02:31.350> playlist<00:02:31.740> you

anything I have a gym music playlist you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.370 
anything I have a gym music playlist you
could<00:02:31.980> check<00:02:32.160> out<00:02:32.959> it's<00:02:33.959> actually<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
could check out it's actually on the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.080 
could check out it's actually on the
channel<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.640> check<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.060> out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
channel so you can just check that out

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.400 
channel so you can just check that out
and<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.480> some<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> songs<00:02:37.020> i<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> on

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and see some of the songs i have on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.670 
and see some of the songs i have on
their<00:02:37.670> fasted<00:02:38.670> training<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.270> cardio<00:02:40.140> yes<00:02:40.530> or

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
their fasted training and cardio yes or

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.670 
their fasted training and cardio yes or
no<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.070> used<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> Train<00:02:42.360> fasted<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.020> thought<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
no I used to Train fasted I thought I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280 
no I used to Train fasted I thought I
liked<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.970> realized<00:02:45.360> how<00:02:45.870> much<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
liked it but I realized how much I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.990 
liked it but I realized how much I
missed<00:02:46.320> eating<00:02:46.860> carbs<00:02:47.160> before<00:02:47.280> training<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
missed eating carbs before training and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.370 
missed eating carbs before training and
how<00:02:48.060> much<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.360> an<00:02:48.450> impact<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:48.870> had<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.140> my

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
how much of an impact they had on my

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.590 
how much of an impact they had on my
training<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.060> necessary

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
training so I don't think it's necessary

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600 
training so I don't think it's necessary
if<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.840> choose<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.830> that's<00:02:53.040> fine<00:02:53.340> but

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
if you choose to do that that's fine but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.420 
if you choose to do that that's fine but
I<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.270> your<00:02:54.770> intensity<00:02:55.770> might<00:02:56.010> suffer

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
I do think your intensity might suffer

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.040 
I do think your intensity might suffer
just<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.730> little<00:02:56.970> bit<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.810> want<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just a little bit but if you want to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.240 
just a little bit but if you want to
give<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.320> try<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.800> see<00:02:58.860> how<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.160> feel

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
give it a try and see how you feel

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.420 
give it a try and see how you feel
that's<00:02:59.700> completely<00:03:00.030> fine<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:01.220> hit<00:03:02.220> more

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that's completely fine is hit more

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.800 
that's completely fine is hit more

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
due to a fasted state as I answered the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330 
due to a fasted state as I answered the
question<00:03:06.330> before<00:03:06.799> if<00:03:07.799> that's<00:03:08.130> what<00:03:08.280> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
question before if that's what you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
question before if that's what you
prefer<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.970> fine<00:03:09.239> i<00:03:09.269> don't<00:03:09.480> recommend<00:03:10.110> doing

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
prefer then fine i don't recommend doing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.460 
prefer then fine i don't recommend doing
any<00:03:10.830> high<00:03:11.070> intensity<00:03:11.580> training<00:03:11.989> fested<00:03:12.989> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
any high intensity training fested you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.500 
any high intensity training fested you
probably<00:03:13.980> won't<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.430> able<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.760> go<00:03:14.970> as<00:03:15.120> intense

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
probably won't be able to go as intense

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.900 
probably won't be able to go as intense
as<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.840> think<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.380> definitely<00:03:17.220> recommend<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
as you think I definitely recommend the
