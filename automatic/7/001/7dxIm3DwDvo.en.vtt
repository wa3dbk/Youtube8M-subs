00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030 
one I think would be great again for
your<00:03:32.070> here<00:03:32.310> we're<00:03:32.810> color<00:03:33.810> treated<00:03:34.320> here<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
your here we're color treated here and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
your here we're color treated here and
you're<00:03:35.310> using<00:03:35.550> heat<00:03:35.850> on<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.570> not

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
you're using heat on it so this is not

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.620 
you're using heat on it so this is not
only<00:03:36.930> particular<00:03:37.500> here<00:03:37.830> from<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.700> heat<00:03:39.450> of

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
only particular here from the heat of

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.690 
only particular here from the heat of
styling<00:03:40.170> tools<00:03:40.440> but<00:03:41.040> also<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.550> going<00:03:41.580> to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
styling tools but also it's going to

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.850 
styling tools but also it's going to
protect<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.150> color<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.600> well<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.769> think

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
protect to color as well and so I think

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.790 
protect to color as well and so I think
it's<00:03:44.070> really<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.580> important<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.110> then<00:03:46.680> if

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
it's really really important and then if

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.910 
it's really really important and then if
you<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.100> want<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> tell<00:03:47.519> me<00:03:47.670> more<00:03:48.060> for
