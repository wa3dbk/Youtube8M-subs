I'm<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.150> chuffed<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> came<00:01:21.810> out

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.170 
I think it looks really really nice the
whole<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.299> cost<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.170> less<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.409> 100<00:01:25.860> quid

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
whole thing cost me less than 100 quid

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
whole thing cost me less than 100 quid
for<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.110> quite<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> nice<00:01:28.500> looking

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
for what is I think quite a nice looking

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.330 
for what is I think quite a nice looking
little<00:01:28.860> bike<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.840> runs<00:01:30.840> nice<00:01:31.079> tires<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.159> good

little bike now runs nice tires are good

00:01:32.340 --> 00:02:11.990 
little bike now runs nice tires are good
and<00:01:32.960> yes<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> started<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.600> listen<00:01:36.630> Oh<00:01:41.509> howdy

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.770 

actually<00:02:13.000> something<00:02:13.180> else<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.390> did<00:02:13.540> forget<00:02:13.720> to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
actually something else I did forget to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.110 
actually something else I did forget to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
mention is I actually took all the the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880 
mention is I actually took all the the
covers<00:02:16.540> off<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.690> engines<00:02:17.140> normally<00:02:17.530> covered

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
but took all the covers off it because I

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.470 
but took all the covers off it because I
wanted<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.820> have<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> engine<00:02:22.390> on
