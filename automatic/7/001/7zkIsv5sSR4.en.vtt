 salt and one and a half liters of filtered water 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 here I already left the same sauce is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.800
 You left at least eight o'clock at 10 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 hours and with filtered water the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.320
 enough to cover them we will 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.489
 the almond water and this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.489
 water that flowed I will not use 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.500
 now I'll put the almonds inside the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500
 indicator 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.270

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:14.960
 also prefer and hit action 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.240
 now that we have practiced almonds for 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.360
 at least three minutes 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.060
 We'll paste the milk, I like 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.050
 put a fine sieve and a little skirt 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.550
 of cotton to pick up the whole 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.270
 almond fiber that will be left over 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.620
 careful putting the little people 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.800
 will necklace 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.950
 all almond milk 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.280
 from time to time I come here O extreme 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.630
 and now it's just the exercise 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.670
 we will repeat this process until 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.200
 to finish all the liquid is excellent 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.090
 you can basically do with any 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 other oleaginous fruit 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.630
 the other one I like because of the taste 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.550
 because it is also very rich in several 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.900
 nutrients is that of Brazil nut 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.730
 but you can make walnuts with a hazelnut 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.010
 Almond it just like any other 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.190
 oleaginous fruit is very rich in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.650
 good fats and antioxidants that will 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.019
 help in the process of unity and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.870
 strengthening the health of children and 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.790
 people even if you are going to use milk 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.910
 of almonds as the only milk of your 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.230
 child is to have attention and offer others 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.940
 foods with higher amounts of 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.220
 protein because it is different from milk 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.680
 the amount of protein and even 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.620
 even of almonds and other 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 oil fruits is much smaller 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.700
 now that I've cut all the liquid to 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.370
 We got two products milk 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.860
 almonds and a mass of almonds 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.470
 it chilled rather delicious 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.690
 little girl that I always do at home but 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.239
 you can also put on the tray and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.519
 bake and take moderate to expect 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.230
 to dry and then to be a flour 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.239
 super peanut that you can 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.610
 add in blends of hats 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.450

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.510
