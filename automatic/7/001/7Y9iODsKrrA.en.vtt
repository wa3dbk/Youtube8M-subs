00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
all of a sudden the weight gets a little

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.550 
all of a sudden the weight gets a little
heavier<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.479> this<00:01:11.780> case<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.200> just<00:01:12.410> saw<00:01:12.530> I

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
heavier in this case you just saw I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
each time you bring something back

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.850 
each time you bring something back

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
you're getting paid for all of that and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.160 
you're getting paid for all of that and
when<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.280> build<00:01:19.520> your<00:01:19.670> bridge<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.810> bridge<00:01:20.959> is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
when you build your bridge the bridge is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.630 
when you build your bridge the bridge is
costing<00:01:21.590> money<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.160> want<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.369> build<00:01:22.520> your

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
costing money and you want to build your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.850 
costing money and you want to build your
bridge<00:01:22.849> for<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.149> least<00:01:23.420> amount<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.840> money<00:01:24.050> so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
bridge for the least amount of money so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.130 
bridge for the least amount of money so
you<00:01:24.950> can<00:01:25.160> maximize<00:01:25.520> your<00:01:26.000> profit<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:26.990> each

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
you can maximize your profit but each

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.660 
you can maximize your profit but each
time<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.560> build<00:01:27.740> bridges<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.250> keep<00:01:28.429> getting

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
time you build bridges to keep getting

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.070 
time you build bridges to keep getting
bigger<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.060> bigger<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.720> gets<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.959> little

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
bigger and bigger and it gets a little

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.499 
bigger and bigger and it gets a little
more<00:01:30.259> difficult<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.709> do<00:01:30.830> that<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:31.509> you

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
more difficult to do that because you

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.520 
more difficult to do that because you
know<00:01:32.539> you<00:01:32.690> want<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.929> make<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> strong<00:01:33.319> enough

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
know you want to make a strong enough

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.820

basically undo your last moves you can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.380 
basically undo your last moves you can
delete<00:01:43.310> your<00:01:43.459> whole<00:01:43.610> setup<00:01:43.849> you<00:01:44.060> can<00:01:44.090> test

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
delete your whole setup you can test

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.510 
delete your whole setup you can test
your<00:01:44.569> setup<00:01:44.840> at<00:01:44.959> any<00:01:45.110> time<00:01:45.349> to<00:01:46.130> check<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.459> out

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
your setup at any time to check it out

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.010 
your setup at any time to check it out
and<00:01:46.580> see<00:01:46.789> how<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.030> failed<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.569> should<00:01:47.840> built

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
and see how I failed I you should built

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.690 
and see how I failed I you should built
one<00:01:48.170> bridge<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.679> then<00:01:49.130> would<00:01:49.250> run<00:01:49.429> it<00:01:49.550> through

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
one bridge and then would run it through

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.600 
one bridge and then would run it through
just<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:51.830> way<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:51.950> could<00:01:52.069> maybe

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
just to see so that way I could maybe

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.919 
just to see so that way I could maybe
not<00:01:52.819> to<00:01:52.940> spend<00:01:53.149> too<00:01:53.179> much<00:01:53.330> money<00:01:53.479> on<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.720> first

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
not to spend too much money on the first

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.540 
not to spend too much money on the first
bridge<00:01:54.200> try<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.560> minimize<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.160> one<00:01:55.340> because

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
bridge try to minimize that one because

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.859 
bridge try to minimize that one because
you<00:01:55.580> have<00:01:55.819> especially<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:56.569> these<00:01:56.629> later

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
you have especially in these later

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.930 
you have especially in these later
levels<00:01:57.080> when<00:01:57.319> you're<00:01:57.440> building

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
levels when you're building

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.730

show you which is level 5 these are
levels<00:02:01.510> 2<00:02:01.840> through<00:02:02.230> 5<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:03.160> is<00:02:03.310> level<00:02:03.550> 5<00:02:03.760> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
levels 2 through 5 this is level 5 and

level five bc i developed three

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.310 
level five bc i developed three
different<00:02:05.980> bridges<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:08.020> was<00:02:08.140> definitely

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
different bridges and it was definitely

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.540 
different bridges and it was definitely
a<00:02:08.590> difficult<00:02:08.770> little<00:02:09.130> level<00:02:09.310> i<00:02:09.340> run<00:02:09.520> through

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
a difficult little level i run through

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.950 
a difficult little level i run through
quite<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.940> few<00:02:10.000> times<00:02:10.210> try<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.630> figure<00:02:10.840> out

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
quite a few times try to figure out

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.420 
quite a few times try to figure out
exactly<00:02:11.440> how<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.620> wanted<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
exactly how I wanted to do it and to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.090 
exactly how I wanted to do it and to
make<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.760> most<00:02:12.850> profitable<00:02:13.920> slope<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.070> a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
make it the most profitable slope is a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
make it the most profitable slope is a
factor<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.670> these<00:02:15.820> cargo<00:02:16.240> guys<00:02:16.420> can't<00:02:16.690> just

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
factor to these cargo guys can't just

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.110 
factor to these cargo guys can't just
walk<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.320> really<00:02:18.040> really<00:02:18.220> steep<00:02:18.490> incline<00:02:18.880> so

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
walk up really really steep incline so

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.310 
walk up really really steep incline so
you<00:02:19.210> got<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> make<00:02:19.540> sure<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.780> account<00:02:20.230> for

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
you got to make sure you account for

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320 
you got to make sure you account for
that<00:02:20.440> especially<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:21.880> start<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> log

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
that especially to if they start to log

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.970 
that especially to if they start to log
jam<00:02:22.570> up<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> last<00:02:23.110> thing<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.740> three

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
jam up the last thing I do is get three

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.950 
jam up the last thing I do is get three
of<00:02:24.010> them<00:02:24.130> standing<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.550> one<00:02:24.670> spot<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.870> you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
of them standing in one spot or you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.740 
of them standing in one spot or you
might<00:02:26.110> see<00:02:26.320> complete<00:02:26.710> matter<00:02:26.920> disaster

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
might see complete matter disaster

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
might see complete matter disaster
anyway<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.900> level<00:02:29.230> ends<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.530> success<00:02:29.980> maybe

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
anyway this level ends and success maybe

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.040 
anyway this level ends and success maybe
you<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.790> wanted<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.240> some<00:02:31.420> spoilers<00:02:31.840> on
