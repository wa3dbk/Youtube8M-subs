00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
than at the beginning of life so I don't

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.190

think<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> lemon<00:02:51.570> tree<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.080> grow

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
think the lemon tree is going to grow

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860 
think the lemon tree is going to grow
inside<00:02:52.470> my<00:02:52.680> belly<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:54.390> never<00:02:54.660> know<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
inside my belly but you never know I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.270 
inside my belly but you never know I
think<00:02:55.110> that's<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> one-in-a-trillion

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
think that's like a one-in-a-trillion

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.040 
think that's like a one-in-a-trillion
chance<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.120> something<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.660> happens

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
chance that something like that happens

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.800 
chance that something like that happens
but<00:02:58.320> that's<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> freak<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> nature<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
but that's like a freak of nature so the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.100 
but that's like a freak of nature so the
juice<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.230> two<00:03:01.470> organic<00:03:01.830> lemons<00:03:02.750> pinch<00:03:03.750> or<00:03:03.930> two

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
juice of two organic lemons pinch or two

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.810 
juice of two organic lemons pinch or two
I<00:03:04.140> probably<00:03:04.620> say<00:03:04.860> picture<00:03:05.220> too<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.489> too<00:03:05.700> much

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
I probably say picture too not too much

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.430 
I probably say picture too not too much
because<00:03:06.030> once<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.480> start<00:03:06.690> dehydrating<00:03:07.320> your

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
because once you start dehydrating your

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.030 
because once you start dehydrating your
food<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.489> flavors<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.299> enhanced<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.040> really
