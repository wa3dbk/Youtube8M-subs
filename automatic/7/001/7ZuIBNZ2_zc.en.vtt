calm<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.370> your<00:00:08.519> tutorial<00:00:08.970> series<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
calm with your tutorial series on the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.570 
calm with your tutorial series on the
new<00:00:09.599> iphone<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> feature<00:00:11.460> we're

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
new iphone for now the feature we're

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.589 
new iphone for now the feature we're
going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> talk<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.030> today<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.360> not

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
going to talk about today is not

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.759 
going to talk about today is not
something<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.139> actually<00:00:13.259> see<00:00:13.650> it's

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
something we can actually see it's

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.200 
something we can actually see it's
actually<00:00:14.040> buried<00:00:14.370> somewhere<00:00:14.820> deep<00:00:15.030> inside

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
actually buried somewhere deep inside

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.779 
actually buried somewhere deep inside
here<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.320> new<00:00:16.410> gyroscope<00:00:17.130> now

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
here it's the new gyroscope now

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
here it's the new gyroscope now
gyroscope<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> motion<00:00:19.080> sensing<00:00:19.439> device<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
gyroscope is a motion sensing device I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
gyroscope is a motion sensing device I
can<00:00:19.980> tell<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.400> way<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.180> tell<00:00:21.660> which

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
can tell which way is up and tell which

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240 
can tell which way is up and tell which
way<00:00:21.960> you're<00:00:22.109> twisting<00:00:22.619> your<00:00:22.650> phone<00:00:22.949> now<00:00:23.130> there

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
way you're twisting your phone now there

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
way you're twisting your phone now there
are<00:00:23.279> always<00:00:23.460> accelerometers<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
are always accelerometers in the in the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
are always accelerometers in the in the
iphone<00:00:26.039> series<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
iphone series so you can see that you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
iphone series so you can see that you
know<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> flip<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> side<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
know if you flip from side to side it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
know if you flip from side to side it
would<00:00:29.640> actually<00:00:29.810> sense<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> were<00:00:31.080> doing

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
would actually sense that you were doing

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
would actually sense that you were doing
that<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> gyroscope<00:00:32.850> does<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.300> actually

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that what the gyroscope does is actually

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.660 
that what the gyroscope does is actually
adds<00:00:33.870> added<00:00:34.469> sensitivities<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.309> instead<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
adds added sensitivities now instead of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.580 
adds added sensitivities now instead of
just<00:00:35.880> three<00:00:36.300> motion<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.780> three<00:00:37.110> axes<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
just three motion or three axes of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
just three motion or three axes of
motion<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.579> consents<00:00:39.030> six<00:00:39.660> axes<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.260> gives

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
motion and consents six axes which gives

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
motion and consents six axes which gives
you<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:40.950> greater<00:00:41.370> fine<00:00:41.760> control<00:00:42.149> over<00:00:42.510> over

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you much greater fine control over over

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.010 
you much greater fine control over over
things<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> show<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> off<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
things so the way to show this off is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.130 
things so the way to show this off is
just<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.410> fire<00:00:46.829> something<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.789> we've<00:00:47.910> got

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
just to fire something up so we've got

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
just to fire something up so we've got
eliminate<00:00:49.140> gun<00:00:49.410> range<00:00:50.059> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
eliminate gun range which is an

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
eliminate gun range which is an
application<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.960> makes<00:00:52.440> use<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
application that makes use of the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.790 
application that makes use of the
gyroscope<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.449> available<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.050> 99<00:00:55.469> cents

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gyroscope here so available for 99 cents

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.180 
gyroscope here so available for 99 cents
in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> app<00:00:56.160> store<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> select<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> gun<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
in the app store so you select a gun and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.150 
in the app store so you select a gun and
go<00:00:59.190> ahead<00:00:59.460> make<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.329> level<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.800> load<00:01:01.949> up

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
go ahead make your level it will load up

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.719 
go ahead make your level it will load up
and<00:01:02.430> once<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.789> done<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.729> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and once it's done that you will see you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.719 
and once it's done that you will see you
have<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.270> ability<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> move<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.100> phone<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
have the ability to move your phone to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.440 
have the ability to move your phone to
aim<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.229> move<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:11.070> phone<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.880> does

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
aim so as I move my phone around it does

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380 
aim so as I move my phone around it does
that<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> shoot<00:01:14.390> at

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that an end and then I can shoot at

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120 
that an end and then I can shoot at
things<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.320> bit<00:01:16.409> hard<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
things so it's a little bit hard to to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
things so it's a little bit hard to to
do<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.600> makes<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
do about you can see it it makes it a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
do about you can see it it makes it a
lot<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.950> sensitive<00:01:20.670> than<00:01:20.700> previous

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
lot more sensitive than previous

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.820 
lot more sensitive than previous
generations<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.350> accelerometer<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.750> and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
generations the accelerometer did and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.120 
generations the accelerometer did and
I'm<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.310> aim<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'm not a very good aim here but you can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
I'm not a very good aim here but you can
see<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> true<00:01:29.970> potential<00:01:30.299> miss<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
see the the true potential miss now this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
see the the true potential miss now this
is<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.710> quick<00:01:32.250> app<00:01:32.880> that's<00:01:33.119> come<00:01:33.329> out

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is just a very quick app that's come out

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
is just a very quick app that's come out
and<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:34.290> other<00:01:34.950> apps<00:01:35.189> come<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and as other apps come out that have the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
and as other apps come out that have the
ability<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> gyroscope<00:01:38.670> you'll

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
ability to to use the gyroscope you'll

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
ability to to use the gyroscope you'll
see<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.390> could<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.259> useful<00:01:40.439> not

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
see that this could be very useful not

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.490 
see that this could be very useful not
only<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.130> gaming<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
only for gaming but for things like the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
only for gaming but for things like the
application<00:01:44.070> layer<00:01:44.340> where<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.240> through

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
application layer where you look through

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.590 
application layer where you look through
the<00:01:45.630> camera<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.380> what's<00:01:46.560> around<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.600> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the camera and see what's around you so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.580 
the camera and see what's around you so
we'll<00:01:48.750> look<00:01:48.810> forward<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> apps

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
we'll look forward to some of the apps
