cuts<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.099> had<00:03:21.220> cut<00:03:21.489> all<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.849> way<00:03:21.970> through

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
cuts and I had cut all the way through

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.699 
cuts and I had cut all the way through
thicker<00:03:23.709> sheets<00:03:24.069> will<00:03:24.280> need<00:03:24.430> more<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.709> since

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
thicker sheets will need more and since

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.210 
thicker sheets will need more and since
this<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.400> basswood<00:03:27.970> sheet<00:03:28.769> it'll<00:03:29.769> need<00:03:29.890> more

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
this is a basswood sheet it'll need more

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.539 
this is a basswood sheet it'll need more
than<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.400> balsa<00:03:30.940> sheet<00:03:31.379> sometimes<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:33.129> first

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
than a balsa sheet sometimes the first

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.020 
than a balsa sheet sometimes the first
strip<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.420> cut<00:03:34.690> from<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:35.049> sheet<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.319> wood<00:03:35.620> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
strip you cut from a sheet of wood is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.750 
strip you cut from a sheet of wood is
not<00:03:37.590> perfectly<00:03:38.590> straight

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
not perfectly straight

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.759 
not perfectly straight
so<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> first<00:03:40.599> strip<00:03:40.930> may<00:03:41.230> need<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.620> be

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
so the first strip may need to be

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.289 
so the first strip may need to be
scrapped<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:47.709> with<00:03:47.890> practice<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:49.000> will<00:03:49.030> be

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
scrapped but with practice you will be

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.830 
scrapped but with practice you will be
able<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.049> make<00:03:50.200> very<00:03:50.650> fine<00:03:51.190> cuts<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.090> get

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
able to make very fine cuts and get

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.770 
able to make very fine cuts and get
better<00:03:53.140> quality<00:03:53.819> then<00:03:54.819> you<00:03:55.120> can<00:03:55.299> buy<00:03:55.540> at<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
better quality then you can buy at the
