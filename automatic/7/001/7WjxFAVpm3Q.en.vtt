00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.430
 Today we will prepare the studs 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.640
 ingredients that we will need are 3 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.760
 Complete eggs 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 two teaspoons of baking powder two 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.720
 teaspoons of vanilla essence and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.880
 250 grams of sifted flour we are going to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 use the blender if the oven 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.410
 The first thing we are going to do is beat 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.830
 the three eggs and let's add it to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.830
 little sugar we beat them very well 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.760
 We are adding little by little sugar 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.750
 and we continue beating you have to beat them 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.750
 very well even about 15 minutes 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.430
 until 15 minutes we already have good 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 mounted eggs with sugar 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.210
 Now let's add the essence of 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.210
 vanilla and incorporate it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 Now we are going to incorporate little by little 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 flour and baking powder in this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 moment we mix with a balloon by hand 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.270
 because we do not want to be lowered 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.409
 we incorporate the eggs and mix it 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.929
 Gently we toss some flour 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.469
 and incorporates it very very well before 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.469
 add more 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 with enveloping movements and springs 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 easy so that we do not lose 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.070
 eggs 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.340
 before finishing throwing all the 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.340
 flour we add the baking powder 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.859
 we incorporate well if we finish off 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.859
 add the rest of the flour 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.750
 you saw we have the dough made like this is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.230
 as it should be 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.860
 Now with a plate suitable for the oven 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.990
 let's bathe him to look for her a little 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 oil 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.970
 with a spoon or with a sleeve 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.710
 pastry we will add the mass of a 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.710
 little separated 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.660
 once we have the plate ready the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.680
 We take the oven to 180 degrees during 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.250
 15 or 20 minutes depending on how we want it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.250
 color 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.890
 after 15 minutes they are ready to 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.890
 Take out of the oven 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.480
 that's how our mostachones were 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.040
 very rich to accompany with milk with 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.040
