00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hi guys, how are you? I put a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.350
 different video grade accessory from my 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 favorite glasses for you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 this glasses here is what most have used 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 that's why I 'm with him that he's a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.380
 he is a sheep and he is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 more brown ax to brown and is the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.380
 I use the most I 'll show you what 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 I even use it because there are some who 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 are stored but I'm never using a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 Myth one day in a day that I bought more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.359
 rigor phase buy for example wifi 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 price that I gave for the better because I 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.370
 use meets the pink evoke and no more use 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 also because it was Saturday's failure 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.040
 so I'll show you what I most do 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.110
 the first one is the one I bought 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 I like to buy several with only 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.239
 cheapie always ends up having several 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.550
 varieties are various types of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.620
 Various models of various types of glasses 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 I do not like these things very much. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.070
 spend on glasses 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 these glasses just do not protect 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.719
 much but it's a different accessory I 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.820
 I really like to play same is one thing 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.519
 that this beach day by day until the end 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.060
 Weekends we're leaving, we 're alone. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.340
 then the first glasses is that here I 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 I like several different styles of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 glasses so I like glasses lens 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 mirror more traditional glasses as 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.750
 different and the first one is the one here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.409
 is the latest I bought it the largest 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 because then it is the model 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 male 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.439
 he has a few white people here 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.259
 both on the side and in front I 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.299
 I bought it on the beach and he's really big I 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 I think it's good because when that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
 you 're advisers very big and he 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 It is then the one that you have with a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.329
 way too flashy so you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.939
 it's all settled he knows he 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.890
 charges for it to be very large and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.280
 I bought at the beach must have paid the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 30 reais and was inexpensive even without 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 know about the beach because I saw it happening 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 I want to try out all the blocks and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 connected and walking for sure as 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 rum 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.560
 so this one was one of them that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 I bought the other one is 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 hence he is a wifi model and he is 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 red and ring will have they are so 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.349
 this glasses here is an original glasses is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.200
 fire ray 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.880
 only I said it very dearly for both 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.980
 that I ended up using it I did not see 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.220
 a lot because I thought I was very little 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 Look at my face style. 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.440
 so I do not really like him to use 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.360
 I think it's kind of rude, you know I 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.430
 I bought red it was marked on my 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.739
 life I would have bought for the star to 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 can use more 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.470
 But that's it, I paid a lot of money, it was a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.920
 regret my future does not give much 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.140
 he the next glasses I'm going to talk 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.720
 now in the phases of the council ruler that I 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.410
 ray ban aviator love the make up what 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.970
 yea 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.519
 it's the slightly simpler one more 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.760
 so I think when 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.920
 You 're a keeper, you can not make-up or 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.620
 in the day to day same resort he stays 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.670
 nothing flashy knows how to look chic and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.799
 elegant 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.070
 the first one is that I did not buy 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.200
 Do not know pink but I bought it on 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.950
 in any lot but I do not think you guys 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.290
 find 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.030
 and here comes this capinha, except that in this 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 here is the original area 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.760
 keep another glasses that I show later 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.640
 for you also another ray ban that I 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.150
 I keep these capes to cnet news eu 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.280
 I have several xilinx vans. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.560
 one more rose that was stored is that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.130
 I'm using but I do not know how to vote for 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.750
 O itself here it is quite different they 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.120
 green and I'm going after him that's how I 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.000
 I like more different games had 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.889
 a time that was well in fashion these 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.319
 colored lenses favorite inspired by 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:00.040
 colors of the games then it was at that time calm 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.370
 and buying bought on March 25 and 25 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.370
 real 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.860
 online that comes straight from China that you 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.960
 Do not know I'm going to leave here the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.910
 link for you I also want several 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.060
 glasses there and I think the quality 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.920
 She was not the best but she broke up. 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.769
 a branch sometimes ends up being 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.990
 Different for those who like 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.030
 the next glasses is another 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.100
 aviator who is this one O 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.530
 he has a little of it is a little 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.060
 mirrored but beyond it is more gradient 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.210
 I do not know if you can see 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.640
 on the side and bellowed in gold 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.260
 I quite like that glasses also only 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 which I found quite normal 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.510
 so I end up using it by performing the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.840
 my players that I like to use 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.060
 during the day and if from here I found 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.740
 March 25 and that 's what I think it was 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.160
 one of the 30 is because it's a little bit more 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.720
 strong here on the sides so pick up 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.530
 Can you feel you're a little more? 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.740
 strong 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 so it's another with your pretty taste 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.430
 the next is another aviator just for a change 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.990
 This is what I bought at Renner and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.720
 Lens It's a little bit to see that I do not know if 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.820
 You 'll see, and he 's an aviator. 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.380
 little less than they end up not using 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.050
 both because I think it gets too much 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.300
 small my face shape then it is 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.700
 one of the councilmen that the menu this one here 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.540
 I bought it at Renner. 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.760
 I bought that I do not remember when I 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.100
 I said but this one I think 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.810
 for us 49 50 reais 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.040
 It was a bit more affection too. 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.810
 I left here in the hood of the tim 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.240
 I thought it was cool for them to 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.060
 inside flaps and protects the 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.910
 advising to leave, I like these 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.280
 here court business and the next 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.400
 glasses that enough is this too 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.430
 glasses aect he is a model kitten he 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.310
 it was also fashionable for someone to post and I 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.689
 I just bought it has gradient lenses. 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.610
 and I bought it on 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.229
 Renee that only I think I do not think 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.360
 you find it and also because you already 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.689
 enough time doing two months I 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.769
 bought and would also do around 49 90 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.199
 and 50 reais 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:23.169
 so they were all my glasses 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.729
