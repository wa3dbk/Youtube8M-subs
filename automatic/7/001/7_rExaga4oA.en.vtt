work it's going to be a dramatic look

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.940 
work it's going to be a dramatic look
though<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.610> I<00:04:05.610> wouldn't<00:04:06.510> put<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.769> much

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
though and I wouldn't put really much

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.210 
though and I wouldn't put really much
time<00:04:08.250> around<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.580> rest<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:08.970> face<00:04:10.220> so

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
time around the rest of your face so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.039 
time around the rest of your face so
that<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.519> eyes<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:14.390> brows<00:04:15.390> stand<00:04:15.870> out<00:04:16.019> a

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
that the eyes and the brows stand out a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.150 
that the eyes and the brows stand out a
little<00:04:16.229> bit<00:04:17.389> it's<00:04:18.389> up<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.010> didn't<00:04:20.010> use

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
little bit it's up to you I didn't use

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.680 
little bit it's up to you I didn't use
much<00:04:20.340> shimmer<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.790> my<00:04:20.880> eyes<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.329> guess<00:04:21.570> it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
much shimmer in my eyes so I guess it

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.510 
much shimmer in my eyes so I guess it
wouldn't<00:04:21.870> matter<00:04:22.019> today<00:04:22.350> can't<00:04:23.220> even<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.490> my
