basically do the double moves by putting

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
basically do the double moves by putting
your<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.960> opponents<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.620> corner<00:00:35.100> which

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
your two opponents in the corner which

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
your two opponents in the corner which
can<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.390> done<00:00:36.600> by<00:00:36.840> dragging<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.620> by<00:00:37.739> Irish<00:00:38.070> whip

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can be done by dragging or by Irish whip

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
can be done by dragging or by Irish whip
both<00:00:39.030> guys<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.960> facing<00:00:40.200> forward<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
both guys have to be facing forward and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.030 
both guys have to be facing forward and
you<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.670> three<00:00:42.149> finishers<00:00:42.780> stored<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.410> like

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you need three finishers stored up like

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.880 
you need three finishers stored up like
you<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> normal<00:00:45.000> OMG<00:00:45.600> moment<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.170> then

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you will go a normal OMG moment and then

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
you will go a normal OMG moment and then
when<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.579> place<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.149> simply<00:00:48.450> go

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
when all that's in place you simply go

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
when all that's in place you simply go
in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> corner<00:00:49.200> press<00:00:49.829> Y<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.430> triangle<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
in the corner press Y or triangle like a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
in the corner press Y or triangle like a
normal<00:00:51.809> finisher<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.430> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
normal finisher and that is how it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.209 
normal finisher and that is how it's
done<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.469> only<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> two

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
done so I think there is only the two

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
done so I think there is only the two
moves<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.820> being<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> double<00:00:57.360> shell<00:00:57.600> shock<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
moves not being a double shell shock and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
moves not being a double shell shock and
double-a<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.699> those<00:00:59.850> double<00:01:00.239> moves<00:01:00.480> should

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
double-a a but those double moves should

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
double-a a but those double moves should
be<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.230> fun<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.520> probably

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
be pretty fun to do and it's probably

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.270 
be pretty fun to do and it's probably
going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> first<00:01:04.379> things<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.010> do

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
going to be one of the first things I do

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to be one of the first things I do
try<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> game<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.960> actually

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
still just some a realistic standpoint

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.810 
still just some a realistic standpoint
I'm<00:03:52.970> not<00:03:53.150> entirely<00:03:53.690> convinced<00:03:53.960> i<00:03:54.830> mean<00:03:55.520> i<00:03:55.550> get

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
I'm not entirely convinced i mean i get

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.340 
I'm not entirely convinced i mean i get
raleigh<00:03:56.090> but<00:03:56.300> i<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.750> shell<00:03:56.990> shocked

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
raleigh but i get the shell shocked

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.200 
raleigh but i get the shell shocked
because<00:03:57.980> right<00:03:58.280> back<00:03:58.490> is<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.670> beast<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.180> know

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
because right back is a beast you know

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.760 
because right back is a beast you know
you<00:03:59.420> could<00:03:59.570> throw<00:03:59.750> people<00:04:00.020> around<00:04:00.320> left<00:04:00.560> right

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
you could throw people around left right

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.100 
you could throw people around left right
and<00:04:00.920> center<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:02.150> moves<00:04:02.420> up<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.630> rock<00:04:02.810> bottom

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
and center but moves up the rock bottom

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.200 
and center but moves up the rock bottom
not<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:03.830> much<00:04:04.010> as<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> catch<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:04.730> finish<00:04:04.820> up

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
not so much as a catch and finish up

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.450 
not so much as a catch and finish up
more<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> capital<00:04:05.870> finisher<00:04:06.380> might<00:04:07.220> look<00:04:07.340> a

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
more the capital finisher might look a

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.910 
more the capital finisher might look a
bit<00:04:07.490> strange<00:04:08.030> i<00:04:08.330> mean<00:04:08.570> guys<00:04:09.080> try<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.710> imagine

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
bit strange i mean guys try and imagine

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.060 
bit strange i mean guys try and imagine
rock<00:04:10.850> vs.<00:04:11.270> stone<00:04:11.570> cold<00:04:11.930> or<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.650> us<00:04:12.740> then

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
rock vs. stone cold or if it to us then

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.940 
rock vs. stone cold or if it to us then
rock<00:04:13.790> froze<00:04:14.180> within<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.690> egg<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:15.110> super<00:04:15.800> rock

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
rock froze within the egg a super rock

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.740 
rock froze within the egg a super rock
bottom<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.970> know<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.239> might<00:04:17.420> look<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.720> bit

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
bottom you know it might look a bit

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.740 
bottom you know it might look a bit
strange<00:04:18.200> but<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.890> guess<00:04:19.790> realism<00:04:20.330> isn't

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
strange but I guess realism isn't

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.020 
strange but I guess realism isn't
everything<00:04:21.020> so<00:04:21.500> hopefully<00:04:21.979> even<00:04:22.550> they're<00:04:22.940> not

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
everything so hopefully even they're not

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.270 
everything so hopefully even they're not
realistic<00:04:23.630> they<00:04:23.900> should<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.200> at<00:04:24.380> least<00:04:24.410> under

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
realistic they should be at least under

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.610 
realistic they should be at least under
