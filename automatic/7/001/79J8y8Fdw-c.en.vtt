hard<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.560> avoid<00:03:46.710> getting<00:03:47.160> hit<00:03:47.430> by<00:03:47.580> them<00:03:47.730> but

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
hard to avoid getting hit by them but

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.320 
hard to avoid getting hit by them but
there's<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.860> few<00:03:50.070> staggered<00:03:50.640> back<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.180> rocks

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
there's a few staggered back the rocks

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.390 
there's a few staggered back the rocks
on<00:03:51.510> different<00:03:51.810> levels<00:03:52.110> just<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.560> careful<00:03:52.980> you

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
on different levels just be careful you

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.250 
on different levels just be careful you
know<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.580> don't<00:03:53.790> want<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.060> waste<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.870> hit<00:03:55.080> on

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
know you don't want to waste a hit on

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.610 
know you don't want to waste a hit on
these<00:03:55.410> after<00:03:55.740> rocks<00:03:56.390> now<00:03:57.390> once<00:03:57.870> we<00:03:58.020> get<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
these after rocks now once we get to the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.520 
these after rocks now once we get to the
third<00:03:58.980> section<00:03:59.780> stuff<00:04:00.780> starts<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> pick<00:04:01.380> up

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
third section stuff starts to pick up

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.700 
third section stuff starts to pick up
just<00:04:01.710> a<00:04:01.860> bit<00:04:02.450> there's<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.540> few<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.900> these<00:04:04.020> really

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
just a bit there's a few of these really

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.220 
just a bit there's a few of these really
annoying<00:04:05.070> eight<00:04:05.400> sign<00:04:05.840> these<00:04:06.840> are<00:04:07.020> some<00:04:07.200> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
annoying eight sign these are some of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.390 
annoying eight sign these are some of
the<00:04:07.290> enemies<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.650> probably<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> most

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the enemies I probably have the most

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.190 
the enemies I probably have the most
trouble<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.240> entire<00:04:09.600> game<00:04:09.840> actually

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
trouble with in the entire game actually

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.070 
trouble with in the entire game actually
because

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
because

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.450 
because
I<00:04:11.170> don't<00:04:11.470> know<00:04:11.530> maybe<00:04:11.800> it's<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.100> I'm<00:04:12.280> not

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
I don't know maybe it's just I'm not

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.490 
I don't know maybe it's just I'm not
very<00:04:12.760> patient<00:04:13.090> when<00:04:13.450> attacking<00:04:13.900> them<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.230> I

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
very patient when attacking them and I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.460 
very patient when attacking them and I
don't<00:04:15.490> know<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.760> got<00:04:16.600> by<00:04:16.750> three<00:04:17.110> home<00:04:17.260> without

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
don't know I got by three home without

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.789 
don't know I got by three home without
getting<00:04:17.860> hit<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.880> now<00:04:19.600> let<00:04:20.260> me<00:04:20.320> continue<00:04:20.500> East

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
getting hit but now let me continue East

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.680 
getting hit but now let me continue East
you'll<00:04:21.070> come<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.459> little<00:04:22.090> elevator<00:04:22.510> here

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
you'll come to a little elevator here

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.440 
you'll come to a little elevator here
just<00:04:22.930> go<00:04:23.200> past<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:23.860> here<00:04:24.310> we<00:04:24.340> have<00:04:24.640> a<00:04:24.880> da

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
just go past it and here we have a da

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.290 
just go past it and here we have a da
IRA<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.500> IRA<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:27.520> almost<00:04:27.730> like<00:04:27.880> diarrhea

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
IRA the IRA it's almost like diarrhea

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.810 
IRA the IRA it's almost like diarrhea
but<00:04:28.600> they're<00:04:29.290> very<00:04:29.530> difficult<00:04:30.220> they<00:04:30.580> have

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
but they're very difficult they have

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.910 
but they're very difficult they have
these<00:04:31.000> huge<00:04:31.110> axes<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.290> they'll<00:04:32.410> just<00:04:32.620> swing

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
these huge axes and they'll just swing

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.950 
these huge axes and they'll just swing
them<00:04:33.040> at<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:34.090> got<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.330> like<00:04:34.570> duck

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
them at you and you got it like duck

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.060 
them at you and you got it like duck
squat<00:04:35.440> hit<00:04:35.740> them<00:04:36.180> but<00:04:37.180> they<00:04:38.080> take<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.620> lot<00:04:38.860> of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
squat hit them but they take a lot of

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.070 
squat hit them but they take a lot of
damage<00:04:39.280> if<00:04:39.550> they<00:04:39.670> hit<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.270> like<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.020> just

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
damage if they hit you and like I just

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.380 
damage if they hit you and like I just
ran<00:04:41.470> right<00:04:41.740> through<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.070> one<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.850> you

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
ran right through that one but you

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.210 
ran right through that one but you
probably<00:04:43.960> have<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> lot<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.830> trouble

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
probably have a lot of trouble

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.880 
probably have a lot of trouble
especially<00:04:45.460> if<00:04:45.850> you're<00:04:45.970> new<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.420> game

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
especially if you're new to this game

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.260 
especially if you're new to this game
this<00:04:47.890> next<00:04:48.190> segment<00:04:48.340> isn't<00:04:48.820> too<00:04:49.030> difficult

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
this next segment isn't too difficult

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.470 
this next segment isn't too difficult
but<00:04:50.170> here<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:51.010> where<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.460> picks<00:04:51.790> up<00:04:51.940> even<00:04:52.270> more

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
but here is where it picks up even more

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.170 
but here is where it picks up even more
as<00:04:52.720> we<00:04:53.260> now<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.950> red<00:04:54.400> dyra

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
as we now have a red dyra

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.170 
as we now have a red dyra
and<00:04:55.360> these<00:04:56.080> red<00:04:56.440> diorama<00:04:57.040> actually<00:04:57.850> toss

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and these red diorama actually toss

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.720 
and these red diorama actually toss
their<00:04:58.540> axes<00:04:58.960> rather<00:04:59.230> than<00:04:59.470> just<00:04:59.710> swipe<00:05:00.490> at<00:05:00.700> you

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
their axes rather than just swipe at you

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.970 
their axes rather than just swipe at you
so<00:05:01.450> I<00:05:01.480> use<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.110> shield<00:05:02.350> spell<00:05:02.620> because<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.920> know

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
so I use the shield spell because I know

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.130 
so I use the shield spell because I know
I<00:05:03.160> usually<00:05:03.640> have<00:05:04.000> trouble<00:05:04.210> with<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.690> guy<00:05:04.900> and

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
I usually have trouble with this guy and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.280 
I usually have trouble with this guy and
the<00:05:06.070> key<00:05:06.340> is<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.850> want<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.120> try<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.780> jump<00:05:08.200> over

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
the key is you want to try to jump over

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.980 
the key is you want to try to jump over
his<00:05:08.920> axis<00:05:09.340> when<00:05:09.490> he<00:05:09.580> throws<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.270> then<00:05:10.720> try

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
his axis when he throws it and then try

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.410 
his axis when he throws it and then try
to<00:05:11.050> get<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.380> sword<00:05:11.830> hit<00:05:12.040> in<00:05:12.220> there<00:05:12.400> sometimes<00:05:13.270> he

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
to get a sword hit in there sometimes he

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.710 
to get a sword hit in there sometimes he
tosses<00:05:13.660> two<00:05:14.020> exes<00:05:14.440> can<00:05:14.710> two<00:05:15.220> exes

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
tosses two exes can two exes

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
tosses two exes can two exes
consecutively<00:05:16.720> which<00:05:17.110> makes<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.590> little

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
consecutively which makes it a little

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.730 
consecutively which makes it a little
difficult<00:05:17.980> other<00:05:18.820> times<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:20.169> can<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.530> sneak

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
difficult other times you can just sneak

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.610 
difficult other times you can just sneak
in<00:05:20.890> a<00:05:20.950> hit<00:05:21.130> between<00:05:21.610> every<00:05:22.120> X<00:05:22.360> throw<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:23.350> did

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
in a hit between every X throw and I did

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620 
in a hit between every X throw and I did
a<00:05:23.650> pretty<00:05:24.010> good<00:05:24.280> job<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.850> time<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.240> only<00:05:25.419> got

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
a pretty good job that time I only got

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.680 
a pretty good job that time I only got
hit<00:05:25.870> once<00:05:26.080> um<00:05:26.620> usually<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.880> get<00:05:27.940> hit<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.419> little

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
hit once um usually I get hit a little

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.830 
hit once um usually I get hit a little
more<00:05:28.900> than<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.230> but<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:30.150> used<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.360> jump<00:05:31.600> spell

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
more than that but I used the jump spell

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.409 
more than that but I used the jump spell
just<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.350> get<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.680> red<00:05:33.160> jar<00:05:33.430> now<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.000> can<00:05:34.270> use

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419

swings its ex in patterns pretty much it

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.520 
swings its ex in patterns pretty much it
is<00:06:15.850> pretty<00:06:16.330> it's<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.660> straightforward<00:06:16.930> pattern

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
is pretty it's a straightforward pattern

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.860 
is pretty it's a straightforward pattern

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.570 
swing stop swinging swinging stop swing
swing<00:06:20.110> and<00:06:20.289> you<00:06:20.620> want<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.919> hit<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.190> when<00:06:21.430> it's

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
swing and you want to hit it when it's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.490 
swing and you want to hit it when it's
not<00:06:21.910> swinging<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.810> just<00:06:23.020> takes<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.320> little

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
not swinging so it just takes a little

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.540 
not swinging so it just takes a little
bit<00:06:23.680> of<00:06:23.800> timing

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
bit of timing

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.750 
bit of timing
to<00:06:24.730> get<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:24.970> right<00:06:26.350> here's<00:06:27.010> another<00:06:27.100> cave<00:06:27.460> with

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
to get it right here's another cave with

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.730 
to get it right here's another cave with
some<00:06:27.790> more<00:06:28.060> of<00:06:28.180> these<00:06:28.300> rather<00:06:29.110> simple<00:06:29.470> enemies

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
some more of these rather simple enemies

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.020 
some more of these rather simple enemies
just<00:06:29.860> take<00:06:30.040> your<00:06:30.160> time<00:06:30.310> with<00:06:30.490> them<00:06:30.640> don't<00:06:30.760> rush

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
just take your time with them don't rush

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.110 
just take your time with them don't rush
and<00:06:31.440> here<00:06:32.440> we<00:06:32.560> have<00:06:32.710> another<00:06:33.160> diagram<00:06:33.610> this

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
and here we have another diagram this

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.090 
and here we have another diagram this
one<00:06:34.330> you<00:06:34.450> have<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.720> duck<00:06:35.140> in<00:06:35.380> order<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.830> hit<00:06:35.950> it

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
one you have to duck in order to hit it

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.880 
one you have to duck in order to hit it
so<00:06:36.340> I'm<00:06:36.820> trying<00:06:37.450> to<00:06:37.480> time<00:06:37.780> it<00:06:37.810> so<00:06:38.080> I<00:06:38.110> go<00:06:38.440> in<00:06:38.620> when

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
so I'm trying to time it so I go in when

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.510 
so I'm trying to time it so I go in when
he's<00:06:39.160> not<00:06:39.400> swinging<00:06:39.760> and<00:06:40.470> this<00:06:41.470> looks<00:06:41.920> a<00:06:42.190> lot

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
he's not swinging and this looks a lot

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.070 
he's not swinging and this looks a lot
easier<00:06:42.970> than<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.270> really<00:06:43.420> is<00:06:43.570> because<00:06:43.840> I'm

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
easier than it really is because I'm

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.860 
easier than it really is because I'm
pretty<00:06:44.860> good<00:06:45.130> at<00:06:45.190> this<00:06:45.340> but<00:06:46.000> it's<00:06:46.420> actually<00:06:46.840> a

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
pretty good at this but it's actually a

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.530 
pretty good at this but it's actually a
lot<00:06:47.230> harder<00:06:47.910> especially<00:06:48.910> if<00:06:49.000> you're<00:06:49.120> brand

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
lot harder especially if you're brand

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.360 
lot harder especially if you're brand
new<00:06:49.600> to<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.960> atmosphere<00:06:50.350> season<00:06:50.800> but<00:06:50.980> then

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
new to the atmosphere season but then

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.670 
new to the atmosphere season but then
you<00:06:51.700> should<00:06:51.910> be<00:06:52.030> okay<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:52.570> there's<00:06:53.320> several

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
you should be okay and there's several

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.800 
you should be okay and there's several
of<00:06:53.950> these<00:06:54.070> Diaries<00:06:54.730> in<00:06:54.940> a<00:06:55.000> row<00:06:55.150> especially<00:06:55.720> in

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
of these Diaries in a row especially in

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.080 
of these Diaries in a row especially in
the<00:06:55.990> in<00:06:56.590> a<00:06:57.160> cave<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.400> we're<00:06:57.760> going<00:06:57.880> to<00:06:57.940> be

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
the in a cave that we're going to be

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.520 
the in a cave that we're going to be
getting<00:06:58.240> to<00:06:58.390> in<00:06:58.750> just<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.200> bit

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530

you<00:07:17.170> have<00:07:17.200> to<00:07:17.470> duck<00:07:17.710> because<00:07:18.130> he's<00:07:18.340> on<00:07:18.490> a<00:07:18.520> lower

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
you have to duck because he's on a lower

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.380 
you have to duck because he's on a lower
platform<00:07:19.890> and<00:07:20.890> just<00:07:21.460> keep<00:07:21.610> striking<00:07:21.850> at<00:07:22.120> him

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390 
platform and just keep striking at him

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.950 
platform and just keep striking at him
there<00:07:23.200> you<00:07:23.290> go<00:07:23.410> I<00:07:23.850> am<00:07:24.850> going<00:07:25.330> to<00:07:25.420> upgrade<00:07:25.600> my
