00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
it doesn't matter where you start or
review<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:39.959> long<00:03:40.080> as<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.320> get<00:03:40.380> that

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.120 

but<00:03:45.040> not<00:03:45.190> view<00:03:45.400> over<00:03:45.700> notes<00:03:45.880> in<00:03:46.000> between<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
but not view over notes in between and

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.270 
but not view over notes in between and
then<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.370> get<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.760> end<00:03:49.000> which<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.630> uh

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
then you get to the end which is uh

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.010 
then you get to the end which is uh
without<00:03:51.280> something<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:54.840> I'm<00:03:55.840> not

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
without something like this I'm not

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.290 
without something like this I'm not
entirely<00:03:56.290> sure<00:03:56.530> if<00:03:56.740> that's<00:03:56.890> correct<00:03:57.130> but<00:03:57.880> it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
entirely sure if that's correct but it

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.990 
entirely sure if that's correct but it
sounds<00:03:58.660> close<00:03:58.870> enough<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:02.320> on<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.920> g<00:04:03.070> string

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
sounds close enough it's on the g string

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.520 
sounds close enough it's on the g string
