00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240
 Y 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.199
 that the rhythm 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.619
 minecraft and today I continue the map review 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.079
 of rat of the fallen 'and I'm sure that 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.750
 it can not be for the introduction and for 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.570
 the title of the video you are watching 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.170
 right now you have no idea what it is 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.320
 this 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.079
 it's and boys is the map of brad of the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.540
 fail as you see this is the beginning and 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.430
 apologize for bringing this review a 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.379
 little bit later than I wanted 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.940
 but good remember that I do these 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.370
 we have a little bit like 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.369
 been the map is worth and especially so that 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.049
 you have the map worth to download in 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:59.920
 the description remember that you have there 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.930
 the good link the most curious thing about this 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.659
 map is that it is created at a very high level 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.030
 very professional voucher is made by a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.860
 team of people and the truth is that it has 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.900
 done a great job the only problem 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.479
 what I see is that you need a good 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.130
 computer to play this map but one 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.619
 As you can see here we have the spawn area 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.270
 neo and fall where you always fall to 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.670
 activate it tripwire and they will have you 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.759
 transport there inside of you will see 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.650
 it smells like you see here it is and although it is 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.650
 be creative I change you in the mode of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.950
 game and all these little things good you 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.450
 will pass some tests worth 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.850
 we would have to choose here a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.869
 difficulty we give to easy now we are 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.880
 open the door 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.770
 we would do a test or the times that it is 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.860
 pretty good now we could kill 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 this zombie and it will give us a good record 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.789
 Athena of the instructions for here and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.399
 we could start playing this map 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.690
 which is very well decorated is very very 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.000
 well created has a great history 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.340
 has a good 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.630
 it's all very very well done guys what 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.000
 The only thing I see is that you need a 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.520
 good computer to play it which I 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.769
 I do not own and that's why maybe I do not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.530
 I enjoyed it as much as I would like but 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.440
 I warn you guys it's a big map 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.730
 has many enemies that are 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.500
 customized is how you see good 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 they are not going to put those secrets with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.209
 even good armors is that they are 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 lying is very very well to 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.380
 perfect decorations and I tell you this 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.260
 what a group of people has done to a 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.870
 pretty professional level and good as 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.450
 You see they are saying a dialogue 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.960
 everything is very well and has even 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.940
 final heads as if it were a game 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.140
 and well there are many tricks 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.290
 as you see here there is no example 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.120
 final and if you notice this is the room and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.640
 now if we go to this final boss you go to 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 see that it is the same room but it is in another 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.320
 totally different site is worth the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 truth is that it is very very curious as 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.240
 You see it's the same room but it's in some 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.700
 totally different coordinates is valid and 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.800
 here would be the final boss and good everything 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.170
 the time more or less follows in the same 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.390
 line of the map but it's very very good 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830
 I recommend that you play because you go 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.960
 to laugh and you're going to 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.420
 suffer because hÃ¶nninger guys is very 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.950
 very complicated especially if you do the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.040
 same fail that I who chose the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.830
 easy difficulty and then like me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.530
 game in his rival 1.4 and crashed in 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.680
 difficult because it always came with difficult 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 OK, and then they killed me all 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.650
 the times they killed me 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.480
 but nothing guys remember that you have in 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.730
 the description the download link of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.730

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.450

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.910
