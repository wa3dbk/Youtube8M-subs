just<00:01:47.759> lose<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> progress<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.259> you

made<00:01:49.590> doing<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> stretch<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> know

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
made doing a stretch because you know

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
made doing a stretch because you know
you<00:01:51.090> left<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.930> too<00:01:52.590> long<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you left something in too long okay so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
you left something in too long okay so
when<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> comes<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.810> styling<00:01:54.990> choose

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I don't wear weave or micros I just

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.859 
I don't wear weave or micros I just
personally<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.459> micros<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.629> feel

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
personally don't like micros and I feel

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.999 
personally don't like micros and I feel
like<00:02:10.080> they

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
like they

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
like they
kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> pull<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> hair<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> little<00:02:12.780> bit

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
kind of pull out the hair a little bit

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.320 
kind of pull out the hair a little bit
too<00:02:13.140> much<00:02:13.409> there<00:02:13.769> they're<00:02:14.010> really<00:02:14.430> small<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
too much there they're really small and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.210 
too much there they're really small and
they<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.720> pull<00:02:15.989> at<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.470> hair<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.040> feel

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
they just pull at the hair and I feel

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.949 
they just pull at the hair and I feel
like<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.700> lead<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> lot<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.360> thinning

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
like that can lead to a lot of thinning

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.320 
like that can lead to a lot of thinning
of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.260> scalp<00:02:19.680> baldness<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> scalp<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
of the scalp baldness of the scalp and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.479 
of the scalp baldness of the scalp and
it's<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.019> very<00:02:22.290> very<00:02:22.440> risky<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.250> that's<00:02:23.400> just

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
it's just very very risky so that's just

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.699 
it's just very very risky so that's just
something<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:24.150> don't<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.230> opinion

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
something that I don't do in my opinion

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.250 
something that I don't do in my opinion

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
but if you do it you know just make sure

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.930 
but if you do it you know just make sure
you<00:02:28.349> don't<00:02:28.440> leave<00:02:28.590> them<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> long<00:02:29.250> time

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you don't leave them for a long time

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.330 
you don't leave them for a long time

because<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> line<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.069> demarcation<00:02:59.220> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
because of the line of demarcation you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.039 
because of the line of demarcation you
want<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> be<00:03:00.239> very<00:03:00.269> careful<00:03:00.629> with<00:03:00.900> that

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
want to be very careful with that

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.380 
want to be very careful with that
because<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.379> line<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.920> very<00:03:02.129> vital<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
because that line is very vital and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.729 
because that line is very vital and
crucial<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> stretch<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
crucial to a stretch because if that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.300 
crucial to a stretch because if that
breaks<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.310> know<00:03:06.319> that's<00:03:07.319> not<00:03:07.590> good<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:07.890> know

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
breaks you know that's not good you know

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
breaks you know that's not good you know
not<00:03:08.640> only<00:03:08.910> are<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.120> losing<00:03:09.359> length<00:03:09.870> retention

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
not only are you losing length retention

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140 
not only are you losing length retention
but<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.790> also<00:03:11.940> lead<00:03:12.030> to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
but you know that can also lead to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.699 
but you know that can also lead to
damaged<00:03:12.480> hair<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:12.959> breakage<00:03:13.500> at

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
damaged hair because that's breakage at

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.039 
damaged hair because that's breakage at
that<00:03:14.010> area<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.640> know<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.180> very<00:03:15.540> careful

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
that area you know so I'm very careful

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.930 
that area you know so I'm very careful
I'm<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.590> great<00:03:16.829> way<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.040> keep<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.790> line

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
I'm a great way to keep that line

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.909 
I'm a great way to keep that line
demarcation<00:03:18.540> intact<00:03:19.079> is<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.620> keep<00:03:19.799> it

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
demarcation intact is to keep it

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.309 
demarcation intact is to keep it
moisturized<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.819> all<00:03:21.000> times

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
moisturized at all times
