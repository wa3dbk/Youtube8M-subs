00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.800
 Tanks With Replaceable Evaporator Head 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.840
 Before cleaning or replacing the evaporator head, please always make sure that the tank is not connected to the battery ... 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.900
 First remove the mouthpiece 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.540
 Turn the tank while filling. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.180
 This will ensure an even distribution of the e-liquid and soak the wick more efficiently in the evaporator head 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.740
 Let the e-liquid rest and arrive regularly. 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.640
 This ensures that the tank is not overfilled and reduces waste 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.560
 Please only fill the Crystal Tanks to just below the 1.6ml mark to prevent overflowing 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:22.020
 When filling a tank for the first time, it should then rest for at least 15 minutes. (VG E-Liquid should rest longer) 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.100
 Put the mouthpiece firmly back on the tank. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.800
 Now take a paper towel and hold it under the tank bottom 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.080
 Now blow easily through the mouthpiece 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.840
 This will remove excess e-liquid 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 Reconnect the battery to the filled tank and it is ready for use again ... 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 After about 10-12 refills, the evaporator head in the tank must be replaced ... 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.600
 To do this, first screw out the tank bottom with the center column 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 Next, remove the evaporator head from the center column 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.260
 Now take the new evaporator head and turn it clockwise on the center post. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.560
 Make sure everything is tight and tight again. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.560
 The Crystal Tanks hold up to 1.6 ml of e-liquid ... 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.720
