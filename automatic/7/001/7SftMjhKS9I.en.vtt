wanting for a while even though like I

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
said they do basically the same thing so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.420 
said they do basically the same thing so
I<00:01:19.700> finally<00:01:19.970> just<00:01:20.150> broke<00:01:20.479> down<00:01:20.619> splurged<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.950> I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
I finally just broke down splurged and I

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.830 
I finally just broke down splurged and I
got<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.610> pair<00:01:23.200> 7999<00:01:24.200> with<00:01:25.040> text<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:25.430> was<00:01:25.520> like

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
got a pair 7999 with text it was like

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.570 
got a pair 7999 with text it was like
$84<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.680> was<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.159> was<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.310> bit<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
$84 so it was it was a bit on the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.399 
$84 so it was it was a bit on the
expensive<00:01:28.760> side<00:01:29.060> I'm<00:01:29.330> not<00:01:29.479> gonna<00:01:29.570> lie<00:01:29.780> but

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
expensive side I'm not gonna lie but

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.899 
expensive side I'm not gonna lie but
when<00:01:30.530> compared<00:01:30.859> to<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.039> Tritons<00:01:31.549> which<00:01:31.789> were

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
when compared to the Tritons which were

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.370 
when compared to the Tritons which were
like<00:01:32.030> over<00:01:32.479> one<00:01:32.600> hundred<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.930> twenty<00:01:33.109> dollars

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
like over one hundred and twenty dollars

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.889 
like over one hundred and twenty dollars
I<00:01:33.619> think<00:01:34.490> going<00:01:35.030> with<00:01:35.240> these<00:01:35.390> seemed<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.869> bit

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
I think going with these seemed a bit

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.330 
I think going with these seemed a bit
more<00:01:36.170> economical<00:01:36.820> but<00:01:37.820> um<00:01:38.680> basically<00:01:39.680> these

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
more economical but um basically these

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.310 
more economical but um basically these
things<00:01:40.820> are<00:01:41.180> even<00:01:41.750> better<00:01:41.899> than<00:01:42.049> what<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.259> was

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
things are even better than what I was

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.870 
things are even better than what I was
using<00:01:42.469> before<00:01:42.619> hand<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.219> used<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.700> able<00:01:43.759> to

up here for probably a good minute and a
half<00:03:34.560> two<00:03:35.250> minutes<00:03:35.370> before<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.790> get<00:03:35.940> killed<00:03:36.180> and

had been playing pretty badly lately and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.960 
had been playing pretty badly lately and
i<00:03:43.709> think<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.070> was<00:03:44.130> mainly<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.580> because<00:03:44.670> of

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
i think it was mainly just because of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.640 
i think it was mainly just because of
the<00:03:45.000> way<00:03:45.120> i<00:03:45.150> was<00:03:45.300> sitting<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.350> sounds<00:03:46.620> a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the way i was sitting and it sounds a

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.610 
the way i was sitting and it sounds a
bit<00:03:46.769> weird<00:03:46.830> but<00:03:47.690> for<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.019> used<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.350> sitting

bit weird but for me I'm used to sitting

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.770

aren't<00:06:13.740> playing<00:06:13.919> well<00:06:14.220> try<00:06:14.550> thinking<00:06:14.940> is

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
aren't playing well try thinking is

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.790 
aren't playing well try thinking is
sitting<00:06:15.389> different<00:06:15.720> and<00:06:15.900> maybe<00:06:16.470> lowering

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
sitting different and maybe lowering

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.260 
sitting different and maybe lowering
your<00:06:16.889> sensitivity<00:06:17.400> one<00:06:17.550> or<00:06:17.669> two<00:06:17.820> and<00:06:18.000> then

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
your sensitivity one or two and then

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.210 
your sensitivity one or two and then
just<00:06:18.449> like<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.930> said<00:06:19.110> just<00:06:19.139> posture<00:06:19.770> can't

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
just like I said just posture can't

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.529 
just like I said just posture can't
believe<00:06:20.370> it<00:06:20.460> makes<00:06:20.610> such<00:06:20.760> a<00:06:20.789> difference<00:06:20.880> but

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
believe it makes such a difference but

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.219 
believe it makes such a difference but
it<00:06:21.690> does<00:06:21.870> um<00:06:22.740> an<00:06:23.639> Afghan<00:06:24.300> is<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.539> good<00:06:24.720> map<00:06:24.900> for

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
it does um an Afghan is a good map for

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.080 
it does um an Afghan is a good map for
free<00:06:25.380> from<00:06:25.560> just<00:06:26.099> because<00:06:26.370> like<00:06:26.610> I<00:06:26.729> said<00:06:26.789> if

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
free from just because like I said if

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.399 
free from just because like I said if
you<00:06:27.180> stay<00:06:27.360> where<00:06:27.479> the<00:06:27.570> sea<00:06:27.720> domination<00:06:28.169> flag

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
you stay where the sea domination flag

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.589 
you stay where the sea domination flag
is<00:06:28.669> there's<00:06:29.669> so<00:06:29.789> much<00:06:29.880> traffic<00:06:30.090> that<00:06:30.419> runs

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
is there's so much traffic that runs

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.730 
is there's so much traffic that runs
through<00:06:30.810> there<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.110> should<00:06:31.260> be<00:06:31.320> completely

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
through there you should be completely
