00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:06.600
 they see interference that is out of sight 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.809
 the driver 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.019
 they were even called the third eye 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.690
 Parktronic 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.039
 can they always be trusted and what is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.200
 dead zone 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.240
 sensors control unit indicator 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.250
 distances small speaker that's all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.110
 system despite a huge family 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.860
 all parktronics work one by one 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.900
 principle 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.820
 sensors transmit and after a split second 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.100
 take reflected off obstacles 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
 ultrasound pulse during this time block 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.789
 control calculates and shows on 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.859
 the indicator is a small 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.109
 speaker or bieber and starts beeping 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.589
 the closer the machines obstruct the more often 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.409
 put at least two sensors on the car 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.899
 notice any wall even one and if 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.899
 rear of the car glass showcase 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.629
 or column or pipe as needed 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.409
 electronic eyes to see such 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.409
 interference two three or four now we 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.410
 clear glass is easily noticed 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.270
 even two sensors parking sensors connected 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.830
 to the terminals of the reversing light bulb as 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.860
 only driver turn on the rear speed 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.100
 sensors are all in the attention bar and so 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.110
 the birth of perhaps the most insidious hindrance 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.770
 check if he gets in sight 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.810
 parking sensors like this two sensors are not 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 saw a bar because he got 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 dead zone it arises as 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.790
 the sensors are far apart 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.800
 signal from them like a daisy petal 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 so even for a small two car 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.520
 radar do not cover all space 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.860
 around the bumper 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.200
 parking sensors with three sensors sure 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.720
 notices the post he no longer hits 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.430
 their dead zone 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.070
 important point the distance from the sensors to 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.350
 the land should be at least half a meter otherwise 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.360
 even the road they perceive as a hindrance 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 radar should not be in sight 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.970
 body fragments hitch and spare 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
 wheel 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.619
 if she infuriates the back otherwise 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.030
 the system will give you a false alarm 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.190
 good parking sensors see an obstacle 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 one and a half meters depending on the model 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.680
 command stop system will issue when to 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.040
 it will remain from 50 to 10 centimeters 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.650
 tilting the surface it can be a shaft 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.049
 pipe the same ramp for wheelchairs 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.629
 shop now see if they catch 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.890
 sensors reflected from such interference 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.480
 the signal is not 2 and 3 and 4 sensors do not notice 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.670
 inclined surface because 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.120
 the elementary law of physics works 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.530
 angle of incidence equals angle of reflection 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 ultrasonic signal is not returned a 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 reflected in the other direction 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.859
 parking sensors loves cleanliness 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.049
 covered with mud sensors are blind shot down 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.209
 sense the system can or beat the flow of water 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.150
 able to scatter the signal and radar not 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.959
 noticed the obstacles that are curious on 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.280
 fur coat sensors do not respond up 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.470
 absorbs ultrasound 3 the most dangerous 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.750
 situation when parktronics become 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.989
 useless dead zone in two 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.139
 radar system lost signal from 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.440
 sloping surface and absorbed 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.260
 fur coat ultrasound 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.800
 such a system teaches to park by 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.500
 sound but case and failure instead 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.880
 habitual great you can hear the crash 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.950
 breaking bumper 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 to prevent this from happening sometimes 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.220
 check how the parking sensor works and not 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 be lazy 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.880
 once again wipe the sensors soft 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.420
 rags 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.420
 I though
