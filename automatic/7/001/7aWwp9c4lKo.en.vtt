00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 for a rock with so-called 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.039
 Reasoned ground this rock the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.670

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.470
 I know and here we go 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.360

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.190
 Break to and the back skirt in the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.659
 rear center with almost gave it 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.950
 we'll have the zipper there later 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.659
 Now we can fix that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.520
 top of the skirt with a circa 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.190
 six-inch-wide strip strap 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.929
 insert lay the cut again and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.350
 the position of the defense then draw with 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.350
 chalk on 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.550
 With the machine I sew now the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.190
 Tear slightly roundish the body shape 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.190
 following and tapering towards the end 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 When ironing I make sure that the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.030
 defensive back center show 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.760
 only through the customers the upper 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 confessed her finished curves and me 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 Now use my rock parts as a part 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.810
 cut to trim the slip 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.099
 now that we have the documents with us 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.019
 Ironing insert fixed and the feeding trough 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.280
 All parts have been cut 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.280
 tried with the edge machine 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.590
 Now we are with all the preparations 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.870
 finished and can start with it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.790
 I put this rock together 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.300
 first pay the coverings to the rock 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.150
 firmly 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.680
 nee you first with the sewing machine on 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.680
 then flatten it 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.530
 Finally, the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.959
 rear skirt middle to the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.709
 zipper approach and then close the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.709
 zipper 1 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.510
 here we see the rock behind 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.180
 the inserted zipper and the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 infected document to the documents 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.720
 I now put the feed and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.720
 steppe is then on with the sewing machine 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.010
 and now we only have two parts left 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.560
 we lie to each other before us 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.510
 you have to connect the back rock with 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.489
 slip and lining and the front skirt with 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.260
 cheap and feed and that is that 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.209
 real clou of this rock we 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.880
 Namely now can sew the pages in 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.610
 a slip we stuck here 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.590
 carefully stitch the pieces together 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.579
 Then they iron and then almost 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.579
 diverge 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.359
 then we iron the hem immediately 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:25.500
 and on the upper rock knew the slip 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:27.800
 flat for the last time on the sewing machine 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.450
 We sew now be the fodder 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.610
 and now comes the cozy part 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.220
 We fix this with a river stitch 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.350
 lining on the zipper and too good 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.350
 Finally, the skirtaum is attached 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.419
 I have a very nice time now 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.039
 crafted skirt and i made 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.270
