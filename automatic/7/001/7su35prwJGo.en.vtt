00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 bob hello everybody it's tony 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 today I find you for a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.580
 little video to show you what and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.050
 the glitz reload because in advance 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.040
 and warfare are scared and the other two 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
 different ways 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 there is a classic way and way 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.960
 a little bit faster but who can 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 to be crucial in some cases of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 bankruptcy so I explain to you so we 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 twenty balls 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 we will say that we pull them up and I press 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 once squared at which one is wasted 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.420
 10 so obviously he will reload 20 he 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.489
 will we stay 90 basle so far we get 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.399
 follows this is the classic reload and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.380
 now we will try the reload faste 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.910
 on this car 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.829
 attention I'm always wasting ball 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 therefore it should we remained 80 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 in logic but look attention 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and face reload and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.250
 unfortunately, only 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 70 see there it's not logical why 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 because the fast rilo i'm going i'm going 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 you make them look good 70 1 2 3 4 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.049
 5 6 7 8 9 10 and there it will be 50 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.960
 look at the difference on the left their 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.820
 island of classics and right the glitz 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.799
 reload reload a little bit more 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.790
 fast you see in slow motion the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.110
 difference and it's a small 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.540
 difference but that is not negligible 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 in the fps it's because the fast 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.439
 reload in fact instead 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 look at his left hand instead of 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.460
 2.2 to remove the ammunition and the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 set aside to recover the bullets 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 who are left in the charger what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.630
 normally done 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 he throws the ammunition look good the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.570
 look good on the left hand there he 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.210
 drop the ammo only if I laugh 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 the aude normally see it's longer 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 but you keep all your balls so that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 can be interesting like for example 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 let's imagine there I could a lot of balloons 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.259
 will keep 2 good there I have left 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.939
 a lot of bullets they will keep 2 e 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.890
 there are two ball bombs left 2 ball 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.450
 even if it's a m 14 it will not do 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.460
 a lot of damage or so you have to be 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 very accurate I have a crucial fight up 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 fast reload muse the super fast aude 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.149
 I'm ready to attack so here we go 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.680
 it was to explain to you 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.550
 make a reload side you pressed two 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.820
 times on the square button or x2 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 xbox so is careful against this 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.330
 that you lose the balls that you 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 remained in the charger at the base so 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.710
 that's it for the video that's all for the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.050
 moment 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.090
 we may find ourselves soon to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.290
 other tips tips on dancing 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.390
 edward fans but not subscribe was
