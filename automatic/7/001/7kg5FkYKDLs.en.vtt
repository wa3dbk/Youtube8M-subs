00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello, I was accused of this issue 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.980
 in that I was too strict about 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.560
 this military and so here is the second 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 the figure from this series is a fireman yes 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 cool interesting i think cool then 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.789
 what can I watch to play fire 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.010
 no monster no super hero no military no 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.000
 banana is already something interesting but why 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.800
 they all look like packaged trupak 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.970
 In this video I already gained experience as 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.159
 reanimate character data therefore 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.720
 let even even only reached the same 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:51.420
 yes yes stuck on fat and I'm not so 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.129
 bad excellent mobility see 100 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.830
 bent knee bend torso no torso no 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.650
 turns but slightly unthought 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.140
 move because the leg bends so 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 so so see how much 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.290
 positions but back here it interferes now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 some kind of trick here and further 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.689
 I can not say that it is bad I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.460
 I say that there are downsides 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.460
 accessories 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.649
 holding on and drank he holds up a figurine 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 fell out well, even the details are visible hair 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.390
 ears in mask all sorts of things but I will say 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.979
 so instead of this fire extinguisher 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.869
 gas cylinder or oxygen 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 balloon they could make the shifts go away 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.399
 a mask so she can be removed and then 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 we saw the face when firefighters would 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.369
 I think much more interesting and yes I 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.249
 recommend it remember minuses i don't 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.340
 I can not say about them and figurines 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:55.619
 unfinished some not enough 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.929
 well done face by some 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.670
 ill-conceived here mobility and in general 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.759
 Baronova Nosta mobility here these 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.149
 figures are a clear problem in this company 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.700
 that's why why give such 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.230
 opportunity is not interesting cool 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.170
 cool but the fireman just they 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.959
 acrobat or not a ballerina he does not need 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.599
 such us mobility provided that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:33.650
 back leg here 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:37.040
 It does not bend the Pope lovely lovely 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:51.109

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:54.319
 I'll go see buy power kit 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.260
 team elite and do not dare say that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.940
 them strange mobility has passed already 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.109
 enough time for nothing 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.530
 happened to these tsam let's try 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:13.250

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:20.840
 oh dear oh dear is not like that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.829
 Looks inside and so sticky as 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:39.859

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.630
 slippery and sticky wolf from 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.609
 Easter Egg before what you need 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.470

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.900
 need or yours no, you shouldn't buy 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.920
