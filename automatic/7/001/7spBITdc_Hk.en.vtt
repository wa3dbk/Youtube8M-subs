 margariteña that is very similar to parrot 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 real and the difference is that this point 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.410
 of the wings they have them that have 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.299
 Amazonian Venezuelan real parrot 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.939
 got in venezuela brazil colombia 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.130
 are the nodules that we know as parrot 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.890
 real and that smell or this achievement the quite 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 On the other hand, the Margariteño ogre or parrot 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.209
 margariteña that is that it has the in the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.180
 room in this one is this red that has 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.610
 here it has yellow and does not talk much 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.950
 it's very little when they are little they do not know 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.140
 can really differentiate you not 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 they can not be differentiated very much if 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.680
 it's real parrot or is parrot margariteña 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.380
 because when they are small they are the same 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 size are very similar are available in 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.849
 practically the same area 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
 instead the parrot margariteña is a 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.380
 bird that is currently in Peru and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.980
 in this one in 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.960
 in danger of extinction so we can 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.000
 see then that the tower 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.670
 margariteña danger of extinction parrot 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 real good thanks to god still no no 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.490
 it is a bird that is in danger of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.990
 extinction the majority of these birds that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.640
 we have here that are three up 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.440
 the moments are birds that have arrived 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.350
 here that come from other good areas 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.970
 we can see that these are wooded areas 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.510
 where there are other houses with ships 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.050
 it does not show much but in other places 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.420
 we can see how there are houses like that 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.970
 that is because it has some birds too 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.340
 big that would see toucans have 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.320
 macaw and also have the real ones and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.920
 Two birds arrived here at our house 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.140
 coming from those places so 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.580
 well we can see the immense vegetation 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.910
 that we have here this is the city ​​of 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.280
 the high teas mirandinos state 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.240
 miranda venezuela and we can see here 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.630
 how are these beautiful Venezuelan birds 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.880
 they are in this good place let's know 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.130
 that we have in venezuela is worth 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.400
 approximately one thousand bolivars that are 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.530
 equals a dollar amount or if 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.530

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.480
 fighting and arguing for a while this time 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.920
 they are not as advanced as we think 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.470
 you can get a lot of your hand because 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.020
 If we put the hand does not bite us 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.730
 what because we do not get it almost from this 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.640
 due to the fact that they are areas of 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.550
 very thick vegetation and it makes good 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.800
 she herself escape they go well come from 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.390
