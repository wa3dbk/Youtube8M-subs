 3 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.930

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.760

 pleasure is to do is exactly the same 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.680
 in nightmare mode more difficult 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.650
 time 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.800

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:54.140
 put on the megaman suit for nothing 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.909

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.610
 Sometimes you can find the helmet only 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.610

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.720
