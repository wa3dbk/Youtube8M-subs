00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
and I guess I'll just get it to it so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
and I guess I'll just get it to it so
here<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.279> iPhone<00:00:23.640> 5<00:00:23.880> pretty<00:00:24.330> standard

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
here is my iPhone 5 pretty standard

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you've seen our iPhone 5 before so this

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
you've seen our iPhone 5 before so this
is<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> looks<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.960> iOS<00:00:28.349> 7

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is just what it looks like with iOS 7

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460 
is just what it looks like with iOS 7
and<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.039> love<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.390> slide<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and I love it so let's just slide this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
and I love it so let's just slide this
is<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.740> home<00:00:31.890> screen<00:00:32.099> pretty<00:00:32.430> basic<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.030> think

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
is my home screen pretty basic I think

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
is my home screen pretty basic I think
and<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.920> all<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.070> folders

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and then over here are all my folders

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
and then over here are all my folders
which<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.969> always<00:00:36.239> sort<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.260> have

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
which I always sort because I just have

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.920 
which I always sort because I just have
to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.680> organized<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.270> over<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to be organized like that so over here I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
to be organized like that so over here I
have<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.200> photography<00:00:40.860> apps<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.579> they're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
have my photography apps and they're

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
have my photography apps and they're
just<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.200> only<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.379> these

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
just all in here I don't only use these

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
just all in here I don't only use these
that's<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> other<00:00:44.579> page<00:00:44.820> but

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that's why they're on the other page but

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
that's why they're on the other page but
these<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.809> go-to<00:00:46.050> apps<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> guess

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
these are like my go-to apps so I guess

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
these are like my go-to apps so I guess
I'll<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> list<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:48.329> first<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I'll just go and list them first and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.150 
I'll just go and list them first and
then<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:49.110> tell<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:49.890> do

and then moved it over a little bit to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.210 
and then moved it over a little bit to
kind<00:03:49.820> of<00:03:49.880> create<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.600> same<00:03:50.870> picture<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.070> it

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
kind of create the same picture so it

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.830 
kind of create the same picture so it
