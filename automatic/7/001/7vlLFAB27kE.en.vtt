00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.139
 good morning dear viewers and 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:14.730
 today's topic is very welcome for 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.800
 flower growers today I want to tell you 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.369
 about clematis 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 not just clematis they call this 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.210
 series 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.670
 northern garden they are called princes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.010
 what do you think why such a name 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 yes because they really like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.359
 princes will grow no need cover no 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.649
 need to cut for the winter no need to take off 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:42.420
 need to do anything 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.600
 they will curl themselves where for example 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.519
 girlish grapes already blew the whole house and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 so the plant broke the whole roof 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.600
 aggressively i would say so myself 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 never will never be this one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.399
 clematis will grow into an adult plant 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.030
 it will be for the third year definitely 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.549
 it will be such a flower plant 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.549
 it's just an incredible amount 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 and what colors terry and colors 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.370
 which note and blue and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.340
 pink and lilac and red 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.100
 from the color middle bicolor that's when you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.580
 take this plant out of the packaging then 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.760
 pay your attention that some already 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 dial color and they will not reset it 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.930
 very unpretentious plant 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.420
 authors and just released buds here 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.390
 they just woke up what does that mean a 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.970
 it means this will reduce first 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.760
 June and this one a bit later 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.620
 but then September and all he will grab 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.110
 will still bloom but 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 The only thing I want to say is remember 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.060
 the fact that all the same in the first year planted 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.610
 plants but of course it should 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.440
 adapt to both weather and nature 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.790
 our and where you are 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.100
 so choose to feed the plant 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.410
 be sure to arrange his soil as 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.240
 written recommendations on the box 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.330
 use good fertilizers 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.450
 flower must do drainage well 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.670
 breaking a brick is not a problem true 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.990
 and put under the roots note 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.640
 here's a recommendation for example 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.890
 written himself in the shadow of the root system 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.130
 and everything else in the sun clematis in 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.800
 Mostly likes so to live therefore all 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.720
 think it over and plant we won't regret it 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.320
