00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello friends I am Carlos I will indicate 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.669
 how is the operation and why 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.220
 the thrust bearing of the nissan fails 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:19.070
 tida 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.070
 very good we go to work 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.200
 here we have an album of intoxication 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.849
 true the send disk in the nissan 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.620
 The truth is spent of course 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.640
 because this is a small kind of 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 true how the operation we have 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.610
 a press also that when changing the kit 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.610
 intoxication 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.810
 Many times the mechanic tells us that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 you have to change the whole kit 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.120
 because now the kit is usually sold 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.280
 complete but what happens when we take out 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.680
 us our income 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 as you will see those little lines that 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.949
 they are there 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.830
 indicates that our press is good 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.610
 usually the finger passes the unita and there 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.440
 there are little lines through all that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.820
 that means that our press still 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's good 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.850
 sometimes many times I change it on 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.940
 mechanical precisely and as for 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.920
 stay with a spare for the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.690
 be able to offer it at some time as 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.080
 energy over for you 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.430
 good continuous is the original position 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.970
 of the disc this is how it goes 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:45.130
 ok then we continue it turns out that the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.380
 here we have the original that is the vale 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.030
 or the voucher or that brings holiness 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.250
 around here we have the brand 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.549
 I do not know if they can distinguish a 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.549
 baleo 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.560
 this is the interior of the east bearing 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.750
 I'm already showing them 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.049
 that you see how it fails and why 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.049
 failure 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.470
 the bearing is usually this one 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.050
 comes in that position when you already 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.740
 step on the pedal 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.160
 this bearing really pushes the sun and 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.380
 makes the clutch of course there is 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.960
 an interior separation between 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.080
 clutch true the clutch disc with 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.080
 the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 with the steering wheel of the vehicle 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.959
 this means so speaking roughly 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.390
 that there is a separation between 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 mobility of the engine and the transmission that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.640
 it would be the gearbox 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.129
 ok then eventually this is a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 original as I was telling you 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.480
 Gummy comes here in 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.060
 here in tocomita comes here in this 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.689
 in this position going does not go the other way 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.360
 it goes like this this little eyelash goes towards 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:14.470
 up and going there there is like under this 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.790
 they are going to carry and this goes inside this 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.620
 I'm going to show you another 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.750
 bearing that is a Chinese this a 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.329
 Chinese bearing that is identical but 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.740
 then we will show the 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.660
 disadvantages 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.610
 inside this cup will work this 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.340
 this food is truly this cup 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.870
 here is going to enter oil pressure or 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.030
 be it or brake fluid like you 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.310
 call and that and that tacit inside goes to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.910
 be a movement 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.470
 with a movement like that in or 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.060
 be out with you standing in the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.450
 pedal and inward when alone 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.450
 let go 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.920
 then this and it breaks with time 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.650
 because the eyelash that brings 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.569
 and it breaks tend to break from that 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.430
 shape 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.430
 thus it is already broken 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:17.219
 we have to distinguish let's change the 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.219
 position and breaks 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.720
 there is good 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.200
 when all the liquid that keeps 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.650
 the pressure here to work at 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.630
 bearing is lost and goes to the bottom of 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.070
 gearbox you look below you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.890
 and there are drops 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.849
 between the gearbox and the engine 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.080
 true 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.969
 very good then 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.619
 this is armed that way 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:51.889
 and that's how he works, that's how 

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:55.429
 work that is the operation that 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.449
 has and that little ball that is already 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:05:01.939
 very small comes in that one in that 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.920
 slot that is there and there is little 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:07.910
 this show with the lift 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.780
 So that 's the job of 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.030
 thrust bearing 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.380
 and it fails, I'm going to show two faults 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.470
 the fault that is there is because when 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.740
 you are waiting for the red light to come out 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.220
 with the vehicle and you are with the pedal 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.770
 stepped 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.380
 and you are doing it justly 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.210
 that you are doing a lot of pressure there 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.160
 The rubber band came in all the way I do not know 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.960
 if you can see it then later when 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.620
 the liquid enters here that goes out to 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.630
 outside 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.080
 moving the bearing of the public what 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.580
 well you do pressure with the pedal 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.950
 waiting for the green light to change and 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.050
 you're putting pressure on the rubber and with 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.620
 the time you yourself is responsible for it 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.680
 break 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.750
 the ideal is that you step on the clutch 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.840
 only and exclusively to enter a 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.660
 change when you go to in a taco or in 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.760
 a rise 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.720
 You make a change, move forward a little and 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.340
 you loose the drunkenness ok and that too 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.250
 comes for this other bread that is the 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.150
 drunk with time is spent 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:18.070
 true that is spent 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.900
 evenly but there are some parts 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.400
 when you for example abuse the 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.440
 clutch 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.710
 you arrive until the rivets until the 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.470
 rivets and those are the rivets here 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.660
 there is a rivet this means that you 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.400
 you change in time before you fail 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.160
 you see that just started to skate a 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.920
 you do not change it and change it 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.650
 because if that rivet that rivet that 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.130
 is there the lining is worn this lining is 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.280
 spend and get to touch that rivet with 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.130
 our press with our press that will 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.660
 will produce a groove a groove or will 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.760
 to scratch will practically leave 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.470
 unused and there it would be 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.270
 recommendable to change all the equipment 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.260
 very good boys I hope you have 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.150
 liked the kit 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.910
 is that I would have shown this 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.740
 form and function of the operation 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.740
 and the whatever is called and he 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.770
 and the death form of the bearing 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.080
 push and of course work as 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.270
 You saw it how it works 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.979
 Carlos if you like denle light soon 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.979
 I will upload how to change 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.539
 this same system of 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:33.669
 Drunkenness in holiness and 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:36.669
 disassemble the box and how to make the change 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.669
 okay
