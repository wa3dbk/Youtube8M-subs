00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Good day friends in touch 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
 maximum Aryans and today we are with you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.240
 let's analyze the program power of which 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.080
 are off timer 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 computer 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 allows you to turn off the computer set 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.770
 you time so you can download this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.560
 the program is just beef google search and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.490
 power of there will be archivist you him 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.150
 unzip and here you need to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 will click on the power of program 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 Now we will turn it on and see what happens with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.350
 her how to work with her for what she 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 generally needed so here it opened in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 the first for what this program is needed 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.969
 first for tea and i use it myself 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.649
 shutdown computer a certain time 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.500
 for example, I like to put before bedtime 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.289
 music for 20 minutes relaxing music 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 and then so that I do not get up and not 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.879
 turn off the computer yourself 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.189
 I turn on this program and it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.070
 turns off the computer at a certain time 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.650
 that is, I listened to music listening 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 the computer itself turns off just 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 perfectly 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 2 for which you can use it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 discipline 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.220
 like yourself and your children for example 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 kids from they can 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.470
 before 1 am get out of contact or 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 from viburnum estate on graders sit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.329
 at the computer you can configure 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 program so that it turns off 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.619
 every day for some specific time 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 so he will not be able to sit up 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.090
 at the computer including you yourself do not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 will not stay up if they themselves from 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.770
 problems with discipline 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 I advise you to also install this program. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 let's go in order now i'm 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.600
 I will talk about how there are options 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 shutdown settings for this program 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.369
 first is the response time here we are 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 put a tick here is worth the time 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.070
 which will turn off the computer 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 01 25 this hour of the night 25 minutes that is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 if we want to assume that you have learned 20 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.229
 10 pm 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.910
 it will be 2200 everything you can roll up later 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.510
 like this program and it will work 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 and turn off the computer 10 pm can 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.790
 also consider the date following this 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.220
 reverse report just you expose 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.170
 necessary time and computer 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:35.170
 turns off after this time here I am 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.630
 clicked gone time the timer started i 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.880
 I use this option when I go to bed 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.970
 sleep and including music is also here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.460
 synchronize with programs on that is, 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 can trigger us after playing 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.920
 some number of tracks 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.070
 here the default is 10 tracks per 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.930
 In fact, this delights are not necessary thing so 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.840
 how can you just count in your head 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.230
 how long will it take 10 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.380
 tracks 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.540
 Well, for example from 143 minutes it is 10 to 30 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.840
 minutes, respectively, just put 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 countdown to 30 minutes and all is well it 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 so more for Ponte rather program 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.470
 this function is not very necessary just set 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.000
 countdown 3 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.690
 we can set the schedule when 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.890
 turn off the computer for example if we 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.050
 we take the average person 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.500
 who goes to work from monday 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.780
 on Friday then according to him 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.850
 weekdays need to invest in a certain 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.790
 time to get up for work for example 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.370
 on Friday is because a little later here 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.760
 for example, it's night and monday 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.640
 Tuesday Wednesday 0 to help on Friday hour 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 nights since you don't have to get up yet 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.890
 so you can customize 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.070
 the program so that it works constantly 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.290
 did not turn off the computer 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.040
 each some specific time and this 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.239
 first of all you need to 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.900
 to build discipline like yourself so 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.060
 to kid 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.900
 here we need to do something 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.900
 the default settings here are here 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.040
 So 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.870
 run the program at windows startup 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.060
 not worth it and we need to put 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.990
 here is a tick that the program was included and 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.610
 here to turn off the program 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.320
 system panel at startup to 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.470
 the program itself was turned on and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.820
 baby I did not notice when it curls 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.310
 so the computer will be the most 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.420
 turn on at one in the morning or when you 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.480
 specialty want 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.260
 and it will discipline 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.350
 great tool that's all 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.600
 the program is quite simple with it 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.150
 You can solve such important problems as 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.210
 discipline and turning on the computer when 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.430
 you listen to music before bed very 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.100
 useful program for the entire video 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.540
 helped you deal with this problem 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.540
 see you next video tutorials
