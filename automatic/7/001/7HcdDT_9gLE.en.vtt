 there is no limit to human perfection 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.410
 thoughts 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 which means there is no limit to perfection 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 hand - crafted products and this is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 turn means that any 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 constructions no matter how versatile they are 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 were not 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.470
 have a certain set of advantages and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.939
 deficiencies 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.130
 Often these disadvantages are associated with 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.350
 feature materials used for 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.870
 device manufacturing and all the experience 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 engineering developers directed 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.930
 to minimize it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.450
 disadvantages and strengthen the advantage in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.969
 our review of a new take-out radiator for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.789
 yamaha grizzly 700 atv 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.010
 today it's unique grown 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 there are no analogues in Europe 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 America, this take-out radiator can 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.840
 see only in Russia and only 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 adam companies he has a number of unique 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 features that are inherent only 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 this is - firstly he 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.500
 Aluminum means light and durable 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.720
 secondly he leans back 90 degrees 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.369
 thereby providing a full 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.400
 access to radiator service 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.070
 battery and fan third to it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.549
 snorkel for three ducts 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.680
 diameter of 63 millimeters fourth this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.689
 takeaway allows you to quickly change the height 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 snorkels 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.380
 fifth he fits on all 2013 models 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.650
 year and the lineup ATVs 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.650
 2014 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.159
 the design consists of two brackets 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.960
 and the removal body itself after installation in 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.450
 Radiator body 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.440
 bolted gets good 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.070
 vibration stiffness on the go almost 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.070
 missing 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.600
 you painted on a special paint 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.640
 resistant to aggressive environment for 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 comparing american you are us serious 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.020
 corrode in 1 year 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.030
 you us reclines easily providing 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:15.610
 free access to the radiator fan 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.890
 and rechargeable battery actually 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.470
 This is an important point because 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 old you we did not provide proper 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.310
 access to these nodes was necessary 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.599
 be sure to take it off and after that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 one could only get to 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.860
 battery or let's say a fan 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.260
 atomic you see us easy 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.720
 leans back if necessary 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.510
 fix in any position twisting 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.159
 just two bolts 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.220
 unique snorkels from the company and there 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.079
 for three 63 mm air ducts 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.569
 Easy to attach to the top of the case. 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.810
 the removal of the radiator just two bolts 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.780
 and now attention you allow us 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.879
 promptly change the snorkel height with this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.629
 It can not boast neither you nor us 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.629
 in one country of the world 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:22.080
 This is a truly unique design. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:24.240
 radiator removal review opinion is necessary 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.400
 note that the take-out of the radiator may be 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.590
 installed on models produced 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.920
 until 2013 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.209
 so on quad bikes new 2014 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 lineup 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.989
 for this you just need to deploy 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.989
 brackets out
