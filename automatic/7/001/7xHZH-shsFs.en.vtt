00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.680
 Y 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 hello and welcome once again to those who 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 commented was March 28 and today we are in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.430
 a new edition of enchÃ­lame the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 server we are in the section of one and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 How could they have read the title and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 I bring book plus some will ask 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.379
 what is this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.900
 this plugin is very basic and very essential 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.839
 in my opinion all the servers 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.550
 they should have a book like this 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.930
 basically it's a rule book or it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 can you give the use that you want 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 for information from your server you will be 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.019
 will grant immediately without any 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.150
 command in box number one the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.670
 users will be able to get rid of this book 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.309
 move it from the inventory place or 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 save it without any problem so that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 do not get in the way and basically what I would do 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 this plugin 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.580
 is through a web click we are going to have a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 click they opened an interface we 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.180
 they opened what would be the pages of the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 book where we would put by 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.770
 example in my case do not configure it with 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 rules this is totally avoidable as 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730
 always attached to the description you 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.710
 I will leave 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.410
 with the section in its simple version and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.300
 in its full version attached that link 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.510
 Of course our dearest most 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.410
 Little word as it says how they will see here 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.930
 says section b 1 book plus and then the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.490
 website of the creator of this plugin 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.560
 agreement towards the official page where 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.510
 you can download it and there you will see 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.790
 all future updates and everything 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.440
 what is coming for the plugin always 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.860
 I advise you to directly enter 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.990
 link 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.610
 here we have what would be a command 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.980
 after applying some changes that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.440
 we will see below with this command 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.530
 do not restart and we love the book and it 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.170
 they would apply all the changes in agreement 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.820
 here as you will see leave a small note 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.160
 saying that edit the book in the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.440
 next default route if you 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.810
 they downloaded the section in its version 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.179
 always in its full version will have 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.310
 a route before this and then it will continue 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.900
 this full version plugins book plus 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.750
 there inside the book plus we will have what 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.910
 what would this config be within this confine 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 we will be able to edit everything 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.660
 that appears to us here in agreement we are going to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.190
 see what he tells us 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.890
 on the first page where it says no 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.900
 insult not to disrespect being and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 do not spam, let's see the page 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.490
 next tells us web the name here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.800
 you will put the name here of your 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.390
 web site can also add the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.740
 Forum the store or whatever you want 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.570
 this is more than anything as an example 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.880
 we are going to open here so that you 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.000
 guide as you will see within the conflict and 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.590
 yes here server rules and name 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 here that is the name that would not be 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.600
 appearing in the item we are going to 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.120
 corroborate it server rules and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.340
 name here in parentheses then here 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.560
 the author here will put the name of his 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.690
 server or the name of yourselves and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.640
 in what appears and here below by and the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.460
 author's name that this will change it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 you already know and then finally the 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.600
 pages I think you can add more 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.180
 pages if we want to add page 3 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.580
 just copy and paste and masters and you 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.400
 we would change here the 2 by the 3 and you 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.739
 we would put here for example x 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.079
 that simple and two the very easy to 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.879
 configure them I repeat for me is a 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.349
 very essential plugin all servers 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.150
 they should have it so that their users 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.220
 know the rules with the most things 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.900
 important server does not pass 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.700
 absolutely nothing so it's not going to 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.500
 occupy radio memory on your servers 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 It is perfect for any kind of 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.700
 big server or guy so you 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.099
 I totally recommend putting this plus 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.130
 so they will officially leave their servers 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.020
 on its sides 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.880
 and good and two here today's video 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.680
 I hope you liked it and for 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.180
 look for new cheeses is the first time 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.590
 that you see is one of my videos I tell you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.570
 the programming of my channel in the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 next where Wednesday and Friday there was 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.830
 in chu lam the server and plugin packs of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.970
 while many famous servers 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.040
 those of roasts there was a series called 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.530
 random test gain where we tested 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.910
 minigame of servers varied as 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.040
 they will have gone lost on a server 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.470
 minecraft we are already finishing the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 maintenance because we have not moved a 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.550
 host much larger in reality or 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.520
 multiple hosts since it is a network 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.870
 composed of more than five servers 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.670
 to improve your experience within 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.710
 server and of course we add 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.050
 many more things plus cookies uploaded like this 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.940
 how attentive I will leave here the ip of 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.560
 server I will also leave my facebook 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.570
 because there I go publishing all the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.000
 new things that come so much in the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.710
 channel like on the server 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.720
 Zulay comment and subscription are very 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.890
 good gesture of gratitude and it will be up to 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.280
 next 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.280
 bye
