you asked the question about if you

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.580 
you asked the question about if you
should<00:00:15.980> always<00:00:16.100> packs<00:00:16.400> for<00:00:16.970> speed<00:00:17.510> by<00:00:17.960> going

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
should always packs for speed by going

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.480 
should always packs for speed by going
really<00:00:18.920> slow<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.300> answer<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:20.600> not<00:00:20.900> always

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
really slow and the answer is not always

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.800 
really slow and the answer is not always
okay<00:00:22.490> okay<00:00:23.060> there<00:00:23.420> are<00:00:23.840> times<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:25.810> practice

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
practice fast to play faster order to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.460 
practice fast to play faster order to
practice<00:00:30.890> playing<00:00:31.550> bastard<00:00:32.029> yeah<00:00:32.360> not<00:00:33.320> all

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
practice playing bastard yeah not all

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.010 
practice playing bastard yeah not all
the<00:00:33.500> time<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.160> if<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:34.640> always<00:00:34.850> practice<00:00:35.570> slow

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
the time but if you always practice slow

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.110 
the time but if you always practice slow
and<00:00:36.410> gradually<00:00:37.010> build<00:00:37.280> up<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.550> speed<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> don't

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
and gradually build up the speed I don't

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.850 
and gradually build up the speed I don't
believe<00:00:38.270> that's<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.780> best<00:00:39.260> way<00:00:39.379> conductor

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
believe that's the best way conductor

believe that's the best way conductor

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
be a runner and you just kind of run

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.600 
be a runner and you just kind of run
around<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.239> track<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.840> then<00:00:51.610> gradually

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
around the track and then gradually

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
around the track and then gradually
start<00:00:53.180> running<00:00:53.510> faster<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:55.360> beg<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.480> and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
start running faster I beg you and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.920 
start running faster I beg you and
faster<00:00:57.550> if<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:58.610> sent<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.030> mean<00:00:59.239> dog<00:00:59.420> chasing

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
faster if we sent a mean dog chasing

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.150 
faster if we sent a mean dog chasing
Yeah<00:01:00.050> right<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.510> form<00:01:02.809> might<00:01:02.989> be<00:01:03.140> horrible<00:01:03.620> so

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
Yeah right the form might be horrible so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.070 
Yeah right the form might be horrible so
I<00:01:04.190> bet<00:01:04.399> your<00:01:04.520> body<00:01:04.670> gets<00:01:04.879> down<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.149> track<00:01:05.390> yeah

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
I bet your body gets down the track yeah

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.889 
I bet your body gets down the track yeah
okay<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:08.830> it's<00:01:09.830> okay<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:11.289> have<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:14.509> be<00:01:14.600> careful

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
okay so it's okay to have to be careful

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:15.880 
okay so it's okay to have to be careful
what<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.020> say<00:01:15.080> here<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.619> want<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.830> be

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
what I say here because I want to be

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.690 
what I say here because I want to be
misinterpreted<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.979> okay<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.520> play<00:01:19.820> sloppy

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
misinterpreted it's okay to play sloppy

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.789 
misinterpreted it's okay to play sloppy
when<00:01:22.700> you're<00:01:22.820> practicing<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.799> some

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
when you're practicing in some

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.100 
when you're practicing in some
situations<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:27.140> sometimes<00:01:28.060> perfection

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
situations because sometimes perfection

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.200 
situations because sometimes perfection
or<00:01:30.110> cleanliness<00:01:30.680> isn't<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.520> specific<00:01:32.000> goal

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
or cleanliness isn't the specific goal

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.500 
or cleanliness isn't the specific goal
that<00:01:32.420> we're<00:01:32.540> working<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.990> at<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.260> time<00:01:34.510> okay

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
that we're working on at that time okay

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.780 
that we're working on at that time okay
speed<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.960> not<00:01:36.110> always<00:01:36.290> about<00:01:36.590> how<00:01:37.280> fast<00:01:37.580> you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
speed is not always about how fast you

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.570 
speed is not always about how fast you
move<00:01:37.909> your<00:01:38.090> hands<00:01:38.920> sometimes<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.189> about<00:01:40.280> how

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
move your hands sometimes it's about how

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.429 
move your hands sometimes it's about how
fast<00:01:40.970> your<00:01:41.240> brain<00:01:41.540> processes<00:01:42.380> information

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.320 

okay<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:46.280> thing<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.670> able<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.909> rip

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
okay so it's one thing to be able to rip

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.780 
okay so it's one thing to be able to rip
up<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.659> down<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.990> guitar<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:49.520> another

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
up and down the guitar it's another

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.999 
up and down the guitar it's another
thing<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.360> be<00:01:50.689> able<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.080> rip<00:01:51.530> up<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.830> down<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
thing to be able to rip up and down the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.219 
thing to be able to rip up and down the
guitar<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.580> actually<00:01:52.960> understand<00:01:53.960> what's

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
guitar and actually understand what's

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.469 
guitar and actually understand what's
clean<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.680> what's<00:01:54.830> not<00:01:55.009> what<00:01:55.970> was<00:01:56.119> accurate

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
clean and what's not what was accurate

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.990 
clean and what's not what was accurate
and<00:01:56.509> what<00:01:56.750> wasn't<00:01:57.400> it's<00:01:58.400> also<00:01:58.579> another<00:01:58.850> thing

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and what wasn't it's also another thing

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.789 
and what wasn't it's also another thing
to<00:01:59.329> be<00:01:59.360> able<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.659> have<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.049> ability<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:00.530> go<00:02:00.560> up

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
to be able to have the ability to go up

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.530 
to be able to have the ability to go up
and<00:02:00.950> down<00:02:01.100> really<00:02:01.549> fast<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.119> as<00:02:02.240> soon<00:02:02.299> as<00:02:02.450> we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
and down really fast but as soon as we

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.140 
and down really fast but as soon as we
put<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.110> real<00:02:03.320> musical<00:02:03.680> context<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.880> you

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
put you in a real musical context or you

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.760 
put you in a real musical context or you
want<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.360> integrate<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:06.079> skill<00:02:06.380> with<00:02:06.590> that

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
want to integrate this skill with that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.069 
want to integrate this skill with that
skill<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.149> difficult<00:02:08.630> time<00:02:08.690> doing

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
skill you have a difficult time doing

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.900 
skill you have a difficult time doing
that<00:02:09.290> because<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.130> never<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:10.700> kind<00:02:10.850> of

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
that because you never get that kind of

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.150 
that because you never get that kind of
practice<00:02:11.269> when<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.680> play<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.799> PEZ<00:02:13.010> you're

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
practice when you play on a PEZ you're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.940 
practice when you play on a PEZ you're
slow<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.700> gradually<00:02:14.090> speed<00:02:14.329> up<00:02:14.590> that's<00:02:15.590> good

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
slow and gradually speed up that's good

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.020 
slow and gradually speed up that's good
for<00:02:16.100> developing<00:02:18.070> precision<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.280> speed<00:02:19.549> over

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
for developing precision and speed over

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.759 
for developing precision and speed over
time<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.570> very<00:02:20.750> precise<00:02:21.110> way<00:02:21.320> but<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:21.620> not

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769

doesn't<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:24.470> alone<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.310> help

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
doesn't that alone is not going to help

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.820 
doesn't that alone is not going to help
you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.800 
you
with<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> overall<00:02:26.370> things<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.630> things

with the overall things with all things

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.930 
with the overall things with all things
related<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.440> how<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.770> would<00:02:29.040> use<00:02:29.070> speed<00:02:29.640> once

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
related to how you would use speed once

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.890 
related to how you would use speed once
you<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:33.120> also<00:02:33.240> wrote<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> couple<00:02:33.720> of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you have it it also wrote a couple of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.760 
you have it it also wrote a couple of
articles<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:35.840> practicing<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:37.080> speed<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
articles on practicing for speed to the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.600 
articles on practicing for speed to the
totally<00:02:38.520> two<00:02:38.730> different<00:02:38.760> strategies<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
totally two different strategies and and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.790 
totally two different strategies and and
those<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.910> additional<00:02:42.540> strategies<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.740> you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
those are additional strategies that you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.180 
those are additional strategies that you
can<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.700> addition<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
can use in addition to the you know the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.340 
can use in addition to the you know the
starting<00:02:47.820> off<00:02:47.970> slow<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.270> gradually<00:02:48.840> building

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
starting off slow and gradually building

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.760 
starting off slow and gradually building
up<00:02:49.500> speed<00:02:49.710> yeah<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.170> take<00:02:52.560> those

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
up speed yeah so when you take those

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.320 
up speed yeah so when you take those
three<00:02:53.070> different<00:02:53.340> ideas<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.000> ideas<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
three different ideas to the ideas and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.360 
three different ideas to the ideas and
those<00:02:54.480> two<00:02:54.600> articles<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.160> just

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
those two articles and what you just

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.970 
those two articles and what you just
said<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.720> may<00:02:57.900> seem<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.650> those<00:02:58.770> are

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
said it may seem that all of those are

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.620 
said it may seem that all of those are
contradictory<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.880> themselves<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.330> they

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
contradictory to themselves that they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.070 
contradictory to themselves that they
you<00:03:01.350> know<00:03:01.380> say<00:03:02.100> well<00:03:02.280> make<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:02.490> your<00:03:02.550> tongue

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
you know say well make up your tongue

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.210 
you know say well make up your tongue
make<00:03:04.080> up<00:03:04.230> your<00:03:04.350> mind<00:03:04.410> time<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:04.950> know<00:03:05.040> which

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
make up your mind time you know which

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.860 
make up your mind time you know which
which<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.060> want<00:03:06.240> me<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
which one you want me to do and the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
over organized divided I'm sorry to buy

ok<00:03:41.580> do<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.450> think<00:03:42.660> Steve<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.930> ever<00:03:43.140> pushed

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
ok do you think Steve I ever pushed

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.990 
ok do you think Steve I ever pushed
himself<00:03:43.470> or<00:03:43.769> do<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:43.920> he<00:03:44.160> always<00:03:44.310> played

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
himself or do you think he always played

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.430 
himself or do you think he always played
as<00:03:45.180> slow<00:03:45.330> as<00:03:45.360> possible<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.959> gradually<00:03:46.290> build

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
as slow as possible and gradually build

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.570 
as slow as possible and gradually build
up<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> speed<00:03:46.769> with<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> metronome<00:03:47.220> his<00:03:47.430> whole

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
up to speed with the metronome his whole

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.340 
up to speed with the metronome his whole
life<00:03:47.730> first<00:03:48.920> answer<00:03:49.920> yeah<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.170> certainly<00:03:52.170> wish

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
life first answer yeah I certainly wish

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.960 
life first answer yeah I certainly wish
to<00:03:52.500> mention<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.800> was<00:03:52.860> certainly<00:03:53.190> would<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.640> he

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to mention I was certainly would if he

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.160 
to mention I was certainly would if he
was<00:03:54.150> teaching<00:03:54.300> somebody<00:03:54.600> he<00:03:54.780> would<00:03:54.900> probably

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
was teaching somebody he would probably

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.920 
was teaching somebody he would probably
tell<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.820> if<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.120> Steve<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.450> was<00:03:57.660> sitting<00:03:57.900> here

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
tell you if you Steve I was sitting here

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.570 
tell you if you Steve I was sitting here
and<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.200> asked<00:03:58.410> him<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> question<00:03:58.590> Steve<00:03:59.370> how

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
and you asked him the question Steve how

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.949 
and you asked him the question Steve how
should<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.820> practice<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.360> build<00:04:00.510> up<00:04:00.570> my<00:04:00.600> speed

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
should I practice to build up my speed

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.880 
should I practice to build up my speed
he<00:04:01.170> would<00:04:01.290> probably<00:04:01.500> say<00:04:01.830> start<00:04:02.130> off<00:04:02.250> slow<00:04:02.550> and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
he would probably say start off slow and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.930 
he would probably say start off slow and
gradually<00:04:04.890> build<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.220> speed<00:04:05.400> make<00:04:05.580> sure<00:04:05.760> it's

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
gradually build to speed make sure it's

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.960 
gradually build to speed make sure it's
clean<00:04:06.180> etc<00:04:06.680> why<00:04:07.680> would<00:04:07.890> he<00:04:07.950> say<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.160> because

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
clean etc why would he say that because

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.170 
clean etc why would he say that because
he<00:04:09.180> doesn't<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.600> all<00:04:09.870> day<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:11.430> go<00:04:11.760> into<00:04:11.910> all

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
he doesn't have all day to go into all

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.140 
he doesn't have all day to go into all
the<00:04:12.209> theory<00:04:12.780> about<00:04:13.019> how<00:04:13.830> each<00:04:14.220> individual

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
the theory about how each individual

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.820 
the theory about how each individual
different<00:04:15.510> strategy<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.200> going<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.440> benefit

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
different strategy is going to benefit

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.800 
different strategy is going to benefit
you<00:04:16.979> because<00:04:17.100> he's<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.640> say<00:04:17.760> one<00:04:18.000> this

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810

kids probably not ready for all that

kids probably not ready for all that
stuff<00:04:20.790> at<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.030> point<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:22.260> that's<00:04:22.919> reasonable

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
stuff at this point is that's reasonable

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.360 
stuff at this point is that's reasonable
one<00:04:23.520> reason<00:04:23.850> number<00:04:23.970> two<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.419> your<00:04:24.900> primary

one reason number two is your primary
challenge<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:27.090> moment<00:04:27.330> might<00:04:27.810> be<00:04:28.050> just

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
challenge in this moment might be just

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.950 
challenge in this moment might be just
to<00:04:28.500> play<00:04:28.710> clean<00:04:29.100> at<00:04:29.550> any<00:04:29.760> speed<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.930> that

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
to play clean at any speed so that

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.630 
to play clean at any speed so that
strategy<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.860> help<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.250> reach<00:04:32.610> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
strategy is going to help you reach that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.360 
strategy is going to help you reach that
goal<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:34.140> if<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:34.320> came<00:04:34.500> back<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.770> him<00:04:35.100> in

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
goal but if you came back to him in

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.810 
goal but if you came back to him in
three<00:04:36.000> years<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.800> he<00:04:37.800> saw<00:04:38.010> your<00:04:38.220> plane<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.760> you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
three years and he saw your plane so you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.410 
three years and he saw your plane so you
get<00:04:38.970> different

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
get different

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.630 
get different
like<00:04:40.080> maybe<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.860> can<00:04:41.010> burn<00:04:41.160> up<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.460> down<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
like maybe you can burn up and down the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.860 
like maybe you can burn up and down the
guitar<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.210> can't<00:04:42.420> integrate<00:04:42.630> those

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
guitar but you can't integrate those

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
guitar but you can't integrate those
skills<00:04:43.140> together<00:04:43.340> he<00:04:44.340> probably<00:04:44.580> would<00:04:44.790> stop

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
skills together he probably would stop

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.780 
skills together he probably would stop
telling<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.830> well<00:04:46.830> kid<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.100> go<00:04:47.400> off<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.580> you

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
telling you well kid you go off and you

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.190 
telling you well kid you go off and you
get<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.030> metronome<00:04:48.420> and<00:04:48.570> start<00:04:48.780> off<00:04:48.870> real<00:04:49.050> slow

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
get a metronome and start off real slow

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.540 
get a metronome and start off real slow
and<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.500> gradually<00:04:49.650> build<00:04:49.890> up<00:04:50.100> speed<00:04:50.220> over

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
and you gradually build up speed over

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.850 
and you gradually build up speed over
time<00:04:51.200> because<00:04:52.200> now<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.380> have<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.830> a

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
time because now you have you have a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.600 
time because now you have you have a
different<00:04:53.010> set<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.340> challenges<00:04:55.460> even<00:04:56.460> with

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
different set of challenges even with

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.190 
different set of challenges even with
even<00:04:56.940> related<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.420> building<00:04:57.570> speed<00:04:57.900> further

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
even related to building speed further

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.490

list of benefits and when to use it how

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.370 
list of benefits and when to use it how
to<00:05:24.720> implement<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:26.220> know<00:05:26.340> it's<00:05:26.630> it's<00:05:27.630> too

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
to implement it you know it's it's too

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.230 
to implement it you know it's it's too
big<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.890> a<00:05:28.980> topic<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.670> answer<00:05:29.910> depends

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
big of a topic so the answer depends

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.900 
big of a topic so the answer depends
upon<00:05:30.360> where<00:05:31.290> you<00:05:31.320> are<00:05:31.650> one<00:05:32.130> point<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.400> also<00:05:35.880> I

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
upon where you are one point and also I

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.010 
upon where you are one point and also I
think<00:05:36.000> in<00:05:36.240> general<00:05:36.360> we<00:05:36.540> take<00:05:36.720> those<00:05:36.870> three

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
think in general we take those three

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.310 
think in general we take those three
strategies<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.770> rotate<00:05:38.760> them<00:05:39.530> okay<00:05:42.140> look<00:05:43.140> what

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
strategies in rotate them okay look what

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.830 
strategies in rotate them okay look what
I<00:05:43.350> see<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.680> next<00:05:44.070> time<00:05:44.450> next<00:05:45.450> year<00:05:45.600> or

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
I see you next time next year or

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.450 
I see you next time next year or
whatever<00:05:46.020> maybe<00:05:46.770> I'll<00:05:46.950> offer<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.310> different

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
whatever maybe I'll offer a different

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.340 
whatever maybe I'll offer a different
advice<00:05:47.790> before<00:05:48.060> where<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.660> think<00:05:49.020> you're<00:05:49.170> at

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
advice before where I think you're at

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.720 
advice before where I think you're at
right<00:05:49.560> now<00:05:49.620> that's<00:05:50.100> what<00:05:50.280> I'm<00:05:50.370> gonna<00:05:50.520> say<00:05:51.410> okay

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
right now that's what I'm gonna say okay

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.940 
right now that's what I'm gonna say okay
so<00:05:53.730> if<00:05:54.000> i<00:05:54.090> was<00:05:54.240> talking<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.690> greg<00:05:55.410> i<00:05:55.620> might<00:05:55.770> say

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
so if i was talking to greg i might say

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.170 
so if i was talking to greg i might say
something<00:05:56.190> different<00:05:56.610> because<00:05:56.760> he's<00:05:57.000> at<00:05:57.150> a

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
something different because he's at a

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.750 
something different because he's at a
different<00:05:57.510> level<00:05:57.600> technically<00:06:01.550> make<00:06:02.550> sense

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
different level technically make sense

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.230 
different level technically make sense
yes<00:06:03.450> cool

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.300 

you
