00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
oh this is what I did like 15 years ago
that's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.680> heavier<00:01:56.189> dude<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that's not a little more heavier dude I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.330 
that's not a little more heavier dude I
want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> look<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.799> woodcut<00:01:58.799> as

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
want to look more like a woodcut as

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.830 
want to look more like a woodcut as
opposed<00:01:59.729> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
opposed to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.469 
opposed to
but<00:02:01.170> an<00:02:01.439> etching<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.460> process<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
but an etching the process is kind of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.950 
but an etching the process is kind of
like<00:02:03.570> etching<00:02:04.109> it's<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.679> taking<00:02:05.340> away<00:02:05.609> your

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
like etching it's it's taking away your

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.910 
like etching it's it's taking away your
positive<00:02:06.960> instead<00:02:07.109> of<00:02:07.229> drawing<00:02:07.469> your

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
positive instead of drawing your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.630 
positive instead of drawing your
positive<00:02:08.819> lives<00:02:09.030> taking<00:02:09.720> away<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.860> positive

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
positive lives taking away the positive

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.490 
positive lives taking away the positive
areas<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.420> you're<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.629> really<00:02:12.870> working<00:02:13.170> in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
areas but you're not really working in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
areas but you're not really working in
negative<00:02:14.040> or<00:02:14.489> also<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.819> look<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> film

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
negative or also would look like a film

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
negative or also would look like a film
negative<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.019> still<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:16.800> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
negative you still have to think of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.699 
negative you still have to think of
what's<00:02:17.160> positive<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.930> rid<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.349> it's

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
what's positive but get rid of it it's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.130 
what's positive but get rid of it it's
kind<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.569> perfectly<00:02:21.569> suited<00:02:22.049> for<00:02:22.080> dyslexic

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
kind of perfectly suited for dyslexic

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
kind of perfectly suited for dyslexic
manually<00:02:25.140> twist<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.620> understand<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.459> yeah<00:02:26.730> so

this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.519> my<00:02:41.670> favorite<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.510> don't<00:02:42.720> even

weird so you think so you can save you
pretty<00:03:15.450> good<00:03:15.690> moving<00:03:16.319> around<00:03:16.590> yeah<00:03:17.340> yeah<00:03:18.239> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
pretty good moving around yeah yeah that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.180 
pretty good moving around yeah yeah that
way<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.599> can<00:03:18.989> use<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.170> different<00:03:19.560> edge<00:03:19.650> this

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
way you can use a different edge this

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.770 
way you can use a different edge this
one<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:21.120> piece<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.859> metal<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:24.630> this

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
one is just a piece of metal see this

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.920 
one is just a piece of metal see this
one<00:03:24.989> here<00:03:25.519> son<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.549> ain't<00:03:26.940> even<00:03:27.389> know<00:03:27.599> what<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
one here son I ain't even know what it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.120 
one here son I ain't even know what it
is<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:29.250> found<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.639> old<00:03:29.819> pencil<00:03:30.090> holder

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
is but I found this old pencil holder

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.300 
is but I found this old pencil holder
and<00:03:32.690> pencils<00:03:33.690> yeah<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.440> if<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.919> has<00:03:35.130> like

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and pencils yeah so if this has like

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.190 
and pencils yeah so if this has like
different<00:03:36.000> edges<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.569> go<00:03:36.630> like<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.139> i

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
different edges I can go like that or i

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.039 
different edges I can go like that or i
can<00:03:37.260> flip<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> over<00:03:37.829> with<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.760> same<00:03:39.049> weight

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
can flip it over with the same weight

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.589 
can flip it over with the same weight
and<00:03:40.319> get<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> little<00:03:40.650> thicker<00:03:40.950> line<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:42.480> use

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
and get a little thicker line I can use

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.330 
and get a little thicker line I can use
the<00:03:42.750> point<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.579> can<00:03:44.579> use<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> side<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:46.829> so

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
the point I can use the side you know so

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.159 
the point I can use the side you know so
pressure<00:03:47.700> makes<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.419> thicker<00:03:48.630> pressure

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
pressure makes it thicker pressure

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.530 
pressure makes it thicker pressure
doesn't<00:03:49.530> know<00:03:49.709> well<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.250> tire<00:03:50.760> like<00:03:51.000> Gary<00:03:51.329> of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
doesn't know well the tire like Gary of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.720 
doesn't know well the tire like Gary of
your<00:03:51.720> scrape<00:03:52.169> your<00:03:52.560> bamboo<00:03:52.829> tend<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.579> your

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
your scrape your bamboo tend to your

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.050 
your scrape your bamboo tend to your
computer<00:03:54.299> yeah<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:54.959> when<00:03:55.169> we<00:03:55.200> see<00:03:55.470> this

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
computer yeah like when we see this

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.309 
computer yeah like when we see this
mr.<00:03:58.060> mouth<00:03:58.239> was<00:03:58.510> using<00:04:00.329> math<00:04:01.329> nerd<00:04:01.720> we're<00:04:02.170> not

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
mr. mouth was using math nerd we're not
