00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
double pawns themselves are never a good

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
double pawns themselves are never a good
thing<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.510> protect<00:01:12.659> each<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.229> they

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
thing they don't protect each other they

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
thing they don't protect each other they
step<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.580> each<00:01:14.610> other's<00:01:14.820> toes<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> try<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
step on each other's toes as you try to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.179 
step on each other's toes as you try to
advance<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.229> board<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.040> they're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
advance up the board and if they're

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
advance up the board and if they're
isolated<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> look<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
isolated when you look over to the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.530 
isolated when you look over to the
e-file<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.560> which<00:01:20.100> means<00:01:20.640> they're<00:01:21.000> doubled

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
e-file here which means they're doubled

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
e-file here which means they're doubled
so<00:01:22.200> they<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.040> top<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> each<00:01:23.640> other<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.450> way

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so they got on top of each other one way

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
so they got on top of each other one way
or<00:01:24.780> another<00:01:24.810> via<00:01:25.200> capture<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.250> no

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
or another via capture but there are no

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
or another via capture but there are no
ponds<00:01:26.700> around<00:01:26.939> them<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> help<00:01:27.720> protect<00:01:27.900> them

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and usually sitting ducks targets for

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
and usually sitting ducks targets for
the<00:01:37.409> enemy<00:01:37.680> pieces<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.729> had<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> rank

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the enemy pieces so if we had to rank

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
the enemy pieces so if we had to rank
double<00:01:39.750> pawns<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.259> worse<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.619> best<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.220> would

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
double pawns from worse to best we would

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.920 
double pawns from worse to best we would
say<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> worst<00:01:42.060> type<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> double<00:01:42.570> pawns

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
say that the worst type of double pawns

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
say that the worst type of double pawns
are<00:01:43.259> isolated<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.159> guess<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.759> say

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
are isolated I guess you could say

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
are isolated I guess you could say
triple<00:01:45.149> pawns<00:01:45.540> possibly<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> ever<00:01:46.560> had

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
triple pawns possibly if you ever had

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
triple pawns possibly if you ever had
three<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.399> even<00:01:47.430> four<00:01:47.759> pawns<00:01:48.270> I've<00:01:48.570> seen

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
three or even four pawns I've seen

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
three or even four pawns I've seen
stacked<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.290> top<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.619> each<00:01:49.680> other<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.040> those

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
stacked on top of each other but those

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
stacked on top of each other but those
cases<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:50.970> rare<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.540> double<00:01:51.899> pawns

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
cases are much more rare so double pawns

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.420 
cases are much more rare so double pawns
that<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.290> isolated<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> problem

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that are isolated are really a problem

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.550 
that are isolated are really a problem
and<00:01:53.850> by<00:01:54.270> themselves<00:01:54.479> never<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> good

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and by themselves never really a good

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
and by themselves never really a good
thing<00:01:55.950> though<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.909> those<00:01:57.000> cases<00:01:57.329> by

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
thing though even in those cases by

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
thing though even in those cases by
definition<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.619> usually<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.189> open

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
definition you do usually have open

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
definition you do usually have open
files<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.719> wouldn't<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:00.990> doubled

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
files because you wouldn't have doubled

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
files because you wouldn't have doubled
pawns<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> hadn't<00:02:02.009> captured<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.490> one

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
pawns if you hadn't captured from one

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
pawns if you hadn't captured from one
file<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> another<00:02:03.149> double<00:02:03.960> pawns<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> still

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
file to another double pawns that still

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
file to another double pawns that still
have<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> protection<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.430> another<00:02:05.700> pawn<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
have the protection of another pawn and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
have the protection of another pawn and
are<00:02:06.630> basically<00:02:07.110> still<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> part<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> larger

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
are basically still a part of a larger

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.969 
are basically still a part of a larger
pawn<00:02:08.520> mass<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.840> necessarily<00:02:10.410> great<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
pawn mass are not necessarily great in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.619 
pawn mass are not necessarily great in
and<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.220> themselves<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:12.000> they're<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.420> not

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
and of themselves but they're really not

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.490 
and of themselves but they're really not
that<00:02:12.870> bad

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that bad

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
that bad
in<00:02:13.650> comparison<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:14.820> two<00:02:15.000> healthy<00:02:15.390> pawns

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
in comparison you see two healthy pawns

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.360 
in comparison you see two healthy pawns
right<00:02:15.960> next<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.320> each<00:02:16.440> other<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.800> advance<00:02:17.070> up

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
right next to each other can advance up

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
right next to each other can advance up
the<00:02:17.400> board<00:02:17.700> protecting<00:02:18.240> each<00:02:18.300> other<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the board protecting each other and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.450 
the board protecting each other and
that's<00:02:19.290> why<00:02:19.470> healthy<00:02:19.830> pawns<00:02:20.070> are<00:02:20.220> always

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
that's why healthy pawns are always

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.310 
that's why healthy pawns are always
better<00:02:20.640> than<00:02:20.760> unhealthy<00:02:21.420> pawns<00:02:21.660> let's<00:02:22.170> talk

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
better than unhealthy pawns let's talk

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320 
better than unhealthy pawns let's talk
about<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> next<00:02:22.800> pawn<00:02:22.980> weakness<00:02:23.340> here<00:02:24.240> we're

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
about the next pawn weakness here we're

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.820 
about the next pawn weakness here we're
going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> talk<00:02:24.660> about<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.930> isolated<00:02:25.590> pawn

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
going to talk about the isolated pawn

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.740 
going to talk about the isolated pawn
particularly<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> D<00:02:27.330> file<00:02:27.600> I'm

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
particularly it's on the D file I'm

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.180 
particularly it's on the D file I'm
going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.990> quickly<00:02:28.200> show<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.740> opening

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
going to quickly show you an opening

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.130 
going to quickly show you an opening
right<00:02:29.730> after<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.150> introduce<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.750> three<00:02:31.050> of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
right after we introduce all three of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.420 
right after we introduce all three of
the<00:02:31.260> pawn<00:02:31.440> weaknesses<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.040> trying<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> get

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the pawn weaknesses I'm trying to get

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
the pawn weaknesses I'm trying to get
across<00:02:32.670> today<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.990> commonly<00:02:34.440> reach<00:02:34.740> an

across today that can commonly reach an

far enough that it's kind of an asset in
the<00:03:05.880> center<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.270> controls<00:03:06.660> critical<00:03:07.080> squares

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the center it controls critical squares

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290 
the center it controls critical squares
often<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> little<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.790> more<00:03:08.970> space

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
often you have a little bit more space

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.090 
often you have a little bit more space
and<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.930> even<00:03:10.050> use<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.440> diagonals

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
and you can even use the diagonals

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.860 
and you can even use the diagonals
around<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> pawn<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.150> potentially<00:03:12.720> create

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
around the pawn to potentially create

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
around the pawn to potentially create
attacking<00:03:13.440> chances<00:03:13.860> many<00:03:14.610> times<00:03:14.880> isolated

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
attacking chances many times isolated

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.820 
attacking chances many times isolated
queen<00:03:15.630> pawn<00:03:15.840> positions<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.350> very<00:03:16.560> dynamic

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
queen pawn positions are very dynamic

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.740 
queen pawn positions are very dynamic
and<00:03:17.250> double-edged<00:03:17.790> lots<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.209> good<00:03:18.420> play<00:03:18.570> for

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and double-edged lots of good play for

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.900 
and double-edged lots of good play for
both<00:03:18.900> sides<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.890> an<00:03:20.040> isolate<00:03:20.370> upon<00:03:20.580> itself

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
both sides so an isolate upon itself

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
both sides so an isolate upon itself
again<00:03:21.330> never<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.780> great<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.680> an<00:03:22.800> isolated

one thing a chess player needs is the

always caught up on all the tactics of

the pieces but your ability to sort of
see<00:03:53.220> where<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> position<00:03:53.880> might<00:03:54.030> be<00:03:54.150> headed

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
see where the position might be headed

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.660 
see where the position might be headed
is<00:03:54.570> based<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.110> what<00:03:55.680> long<00:03:55.950> term<00:03:55.980> weaknesses

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
is based on what long term weaknesses

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.910 
is based on what long term weaknesses
you<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.209> pawns<00:03:57.450> are<00:03:57.750> always<00:03:58.110> dictating

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
you have and pawns are always dictating

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.470 
you have and pawns are always dictating
those<00:03:59.100> factors<00:03:59.580> because<00:03:59.880> pawns<00:04:00.090> are<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.299> only

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
those factors because pawns are the only

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000 
those factors because pawns are the only
pieces<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.900> can't<00:04:01.110> go<00:04:01.200> back<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.440> everything

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
pieces that can't go back so everything

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.949 
pieces that can't go back so everything
they<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.640> technically<00:04:03.000> long<00:04:03.299> term<00:04:03.600> so

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
they do is technically long term so

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.479 
they do is technically long term so
again<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.560> other<00:04:04.739> parts<00:04:05.100> we're<00:04:05.190> going<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.400> look

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
again in other parts we're going to look

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.100 
again in other parts we're going to look
at<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.700> pawn<00:04:05.880> assets<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.600> eventually<00:04:06.959> look

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
at the pawn assets and eventually look

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.199 
at the pawn assets and eventually look
at<00:04:07.200> pawn<00:04:07.380> play<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.010> these<00:04:08.430> are<00:04:08.610> very<00:04:08.880> quick

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
at pawn play and these are very quick

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.780 
at pawn play and these are very quick

looking<00:04:27.330> at<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.479> chessboard<00:04:27.720> with<00:04:28.110> no<00:04:28.259> other

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
looking at a chessboard with no other

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.590 
looking at a chessboard with no other
pieces<00:04:28.680> besides<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.220> pawns<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:30.360> in<00:04:30.479> this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
pieces besides the pawns and so in this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.930 
pieces besides the pawns and so in this
case<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:31.410> set<00:04:31.620> up<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:31.919> enemy<00:04:32.100> pawn<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:32.820> to

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
case we set up one enemy pawn just to

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.400 
case we set up one enemy pawn just to
highlight<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.479> third<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.840> final<00:04:33.960> weakness

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
highlight the third and final weakness

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.960 
highlight the third and final weakness
of<00:04:34.500> today's<00:04:34.740> video<00:04:35.009> which<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.789> pawn

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
of today's video which is that the pawn

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
on b2 is a backward pawn a backward pawn

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.060 
on b2 is a backward pawn a backward pawn

by definition is a pawn that cannot

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.550 
by definition is a pawn that cannot

advance due to capture moving it once

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.100 
advance due to capture moving it once
would<00:04:44.340> run<00:04:44.580> into<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.820> capture<00:04:45.270> here<00:04:45.539> whereas

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
would run into a capture here whereas

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.020 
would run into a capture here whereas
moving<00:04:46.410> at<00:04:46.530> twice<00:04:46.800> would<00:04:47.280> run<00:04:47.460> into<00:04:47.610> capture

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
moving at twice would run into capture

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.360 
moving at twice would run into capture

really big weakness almost just as bad
as<00:05:07.590> an<00:05:07.710> isolated<00:05:08.250> pawn<00:05:08.460> or<00:05:08.669> even<00:05:09.210> isolate

double<00:05:09.810> pawns<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.199> a<00:05:10.229> backward<00:05:10.740> pawn<00:05:10.889> is<00:05:11.039> not

double pawns so a backward pawn is not
something<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.580> want<00:05:11.789> but<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.780> does<00:05:12.930> happen

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
something you want but it does happen

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.710

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
of backward pawns might be something

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.650 
of backward pawns might be something
like<00:05:17.220> this<00:05:17.430> where<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.030> see<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.419> one

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660

black pawn before technically if you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.339 
black pawn before technically if you

almost<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.979> highly<00:05:26.220> improbable<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:27.330> would

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
almost and highly improbable you would

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.969 
almost and highly improbable you would
if<00:05:27.720> you're<00:05:27.900> just<00:05:28.110> looking<00:05:28.410> at<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.590> pawns<00:05:28.770> you

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
if you're just looking at the pawns you

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.290 
if you're just looking at the pawns you
would<00:05:29.130> see<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.400> one<00:05:29.639> move<00:05:29.880> allows<00:05:30.150> the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
would see that one move allows the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.500 
would see that one move allows the
capture<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:31.380> move<00:05:31.680> again<00:05:32.010> on<00:05:32.160> passant<00:05:32.580> the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
capture to move again on passant the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.360 
capture to move again on passant the
same<00:05:33.780> on<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.139> side<00:05:34.349> of<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.530> board<00:05:34.770> which

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
same on this side of the board which

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.100 
same on this side of the board which
means<00:05:35.610> essentially<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.180> pawn<00:05:36.389> on<00:05:36.539> b4<00:05:36.570> is

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
means essentially this pawn on b4 is

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.589 
means essentially this pawn on b4 is
worth<00:05:37.349> just<00:05:37.680> as<00:05:37.860> much<00:05:38.099> as<00:05:38.400> all<00:05:39.000> three<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.479> these

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
worth just as much as all three of these

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.770 
worth just as much as all three of these
pawns<00:05:39.900> if<00:05:40.289> not<00:05:40.530> for<00:05:40.740> other<00:05:40.889> factors<00:05:41.190> so<00:05:42.000> that's

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
pawns if not for other factors so that's

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.300 
pawns if not for other factors so that's
not<00:05:42.990> really<00:05:43.409> practical<00:05:43.979> because<00:05:44.010> there<00:05:44.220> are

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
not really practical because there are

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.219 
not really practical because there are
always<00:05:44.490> other<00:05:44.849> factors<00:05:45.360> but<00:05:45.659> your<00:05:45.840> ability<00:05:46.050> to

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
always other factors but your ability to

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.170 
always other factors but your ability to
look<00:05:46.380> at<00:05:46.500> pawn<00:05:46.710> weaknesses<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.430> see<00:05:48.000> the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
look at pawn weaknesses and see the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.810 
look at pawn weaknesses and see the
future<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.690> a<00:05:48.780> position<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.409> maybe<00:05:50.190> based<00:05:50.520> on

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
future of a position is maybe based on

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.580 
future of a position is maybe based on
looking<00:05:51.150> at<00:05:51.300> weaknesses<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.050> weak<00:05:52.229> squares

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
looking at weaknesses and weak squares

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.830 
looking at weaknesses and weak squares
surrounding<00:05:52.860> pawns<00:05:53.430> like<00:05:53.820> this<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.360> so<00:05:54.690> this

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
surrounding pawns like this and so this

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.120 
surrounding pawns like this and so this
type<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.050> knowledge<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.770> ability<00:05:55.949> to

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
type of knowledge and the ability to

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.409 
type of knowledge and the ability to
recognize<00:05:56.610> double<00:05:57.030> pawns

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
recognize double pawns

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.960 
recognize double pawns
isolated<00:05:58.110> pawns<00:05:58.320> and<00:05:58.650> backward<00:05:59.400> pawns<00:05:59.610> can<00:05:59.849> be

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
isolated pawns and backward pawns can be
