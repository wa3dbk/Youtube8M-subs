00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 Have you ever thought about the near future ? 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 no I'm not talking about the appearance of flying 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.840
 boards from the movie back to the future or about 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 the emergence of huge fighting robots more 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.920
 interesting is the social side 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 questions so how are we going to be in the future 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.720
 communicate what will be moral values 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.059
 and how we will be judged for deeds and in 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.399
 In this case, we are interested in exactly how 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.229
 whether we will be judged by judges 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.089
 who passes judgment on the spot 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.160
 then we may be from childhood 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.660
 program so we assume 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.509
 we canâ€™t kill another 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.220
 man what is it all just today 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.220
 on our operating table anemia 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.430
 The near future of mankind has learned

 holographic tenderness technical 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.829
 of progress 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 but our story is detectives their work 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.789
 also underwent great changes 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.950
 the fact is that in the future everyone 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.140
 has a psycho passport which indicates 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.819
 his psychological state 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.979
 psychological rate of crime 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.079
 condition is measured by color background and 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.270
 If your color background, God forbid, will be 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.490
 that color which is better not to become 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.740
 you will gain the status of a potential 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.869
 criminal and you will be given a ticket to

 bright future coefficient 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.780

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.259
 order runs all great 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.659
 computer codenamed systems 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.640
 mastered themselves detectives carry weapons under 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.530

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.310
 constantly gets psycho data 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.870
 regime 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.799
 if the crime rate 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.430
 the suspect is not much exceeded 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.569
 allowable dominator 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.819
 idle skin 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.980
 but if the figures are higher than the roof then 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.180
 hello bloody mince without trial and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.249
 the consequences the story tells us about 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.680
 a detective named coca messina and his 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.400
 colleagues on the way to gi back home and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.819
 mass logo 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 Sus her to the game I her a bit of a sound and a novice 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.599
 most ryokan and they investigate at first 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.280
 view not related to each other 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.519
 crime but in the course of the plot 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.980
 it turns out that everything is not so simple yes I 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.959
 they say a lot of times but everything is really not 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 so just not easy to talk about 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.239
 the plot and the detectives did not spoil so 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.230
 that I will say briefly yes it is a detective and 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.269
 quite her savoy 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.480
 and if you think everything will be grounded 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.639
 on the infinite then you are right only 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.859
 half sially intelligently divided into 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.510
 investigation and shootout and as soon as 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.340
 you start to bother to watch 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.949
 chatter you start to entertain 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.049
 shootouts and place to place by the way not 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.939
 stingy 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.519
 what is different from anime from others but 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.349
 most likely cyber bank is good 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.090
 Mighty cyberpunk with great 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.549
 soundtrack and I don't want to say that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.799
 before attention was cyber yet but 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.930
 agree last years to match it 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.729
 some school superheroes either 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.560
 school perversions with 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.609
 high school revenge unnatural 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.859
 big breasts 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.370
 cyberpunk is good and when is it 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.439
 And not about schoolchild this at all sweetie 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.989
 Well, for reporting, I will say that the visual 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.590
 the piece is beyond praise the music is also not 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.759
 lagging behind 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.759
 the verdict noticed genre will be flooded with a rainbow 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:59.340
 4.8 and sleep on it all put your fingers 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.379
 shorter legs do what we always you 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 we ask if of course you do nâ€™t 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.790
 and if you can not put laziness but you 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.790
 better put okay park 2
