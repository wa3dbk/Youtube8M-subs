00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
would not expect me to make a video like

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.150 
would not expect me to make a video like
this<00:00:11.309> but<00:00:12.290> hey<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.469> never<00:00:13.620> too<00:00:13.799> late<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> try

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
this but hey it's never too late to try

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
this but hey it's never too late to try
something<00:00:14.460> new<00:00:14.490> right<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.440> what<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
something new right and what I have to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
something new right and what I have to
demonstrate<00:00:17.340> here<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.300> video<00:00:18.779> blog

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
demonstrate here in this video blog

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
demonstrate here in this video blog
posts<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> something<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> probably

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
posts is something that is probably

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
posts is something that is probably
pretty<00:00:21.869> difficult<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.380> describe<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.920> words

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
pretty difficult to describe with words

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
pretty difficult to describe with words
so<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.609> probably<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.779> thing<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
so it's probably a good thing to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
so it's probably a good thing to
demonstrate<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.529> video<00:00:25.970> what<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

a Dyna flex power ball it's a little

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
a Dyna flex power ball it's a little
device<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.420> used<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.250> exercising<00:00:35.250> your

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
let me try it and I started working I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
let me try it and I started working I
was<00:00:48.210> hooked<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.570> away<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.770> very

only want do this one time if you try to
do<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> multiple<00:01:48.600> times<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.229> faster

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
do it multiple times to get it faster

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
do it multiple times to get it faster
it's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.520> faster<00:01:50.909> each<00:01:51.060> pass

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it's not gonna go any faster each pass

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's not gonna go any faster each pass
is<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> slow<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> little

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
is just going to slow it down a little

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.600 
is just going to slow it down a little
bit<00:01:54.259> once<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.560> spin<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.460> get

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
bit once you do spin it if you can get

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.819 
bit once you do spin it if you can get
it<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> start<00:01:56.869> showing<00:01:57.869> blue<00:01:58.200> lights<00:01:58.439> inside

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it to start showing blue lights inside

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.230 
it to start showing blue lights inside
with<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.250> thumb<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
with your thumb that's really good that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.220 
with your thumb that's really good that
means<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
means that

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.960 
means that
a<00:02:01.260> lot<00:02:01.830> easier<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.220> start<00:02:02.460> over<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.700> put<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
a lot easier to start over you put in

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.170 
a lot easier to start over you put in
your<00:02:03.060> hand<00:02:04.370> once<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.820> spinning

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
your hand once you do get it spinning

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.910 
your hand once you do get it spinning
fast<00:02:06.540> enough<00:02:06.690> preferably<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.440> blue<00:02:07.680> lights

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
fast enough preferably with blue lights

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
fast enough preferably with blue lights
you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.420> hand<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you can put it in your hand like this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can put it in your hand like this
and<00:02:10.850> this<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:11.910> actually<00:02:12.570> how<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and this is actually how the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
and this is actually how the
instructions<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.670> came<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.270> said<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
instructions that came with it said to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.200 
instructions that came with it said to
hold<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.500> from<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.460> rotate<00:02:18.150> it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
hold it and from here you just rotate it

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.170 
hold it and from here you just rotate it
left<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.690> right<00:02:18.720> as<00:02:19.110> fast<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
left and right as fast as you can and it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.550 
left and right as fast as you can and it
should<00:02:21.390> pick<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.690> speed<00:02:21.990> blue<00:02:22.200> lights<00:02:22.410> should

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
should pick up speed blue lights should

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.200 
should pick up speed blue lights should
get<00:02:22.710> brighter<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.670> once<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.970> hear<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
get brighter and once you hear the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.970 
get brighter and once you hear the
gyroscope<00:02:24.690> spinning<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.740> switch<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
gyroscope spinning up you can switch to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.970 
gyroscope spinning up you can switch to
a<00:02:26.280> more<00:02:26.850> solid<00:02:27.060> grip<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.170> then

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
a more solid grip like this and then

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.310 
a more solid grip like this and then
just<00:02:29.160> use<00:02:29.310> your<00:02:29.370> wrist<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> rotate<00:02:30.320> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
just use your wrist to rotate the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.190 
just use your wrist to rotate the
gyroscope<00:02:32.570> there<00:02:33.570> are<00:02:33.720> other<00:02:33.870> ways<00:02:34.020> of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
gyroscope there are other ways of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260 
gyroscope there are other ways of
starting<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.680> course<00:02:35.000> once<00:02:36.000> you're<00:02:36.210> used

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
starting it of course once you're used

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.420 
starting it of course once you're used
to<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.750> motion<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:38.070> actually<00:02:38.190> go

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to this motion you can actually go

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.950 
to this motion you can actually go
straight<00:02:38.820> from<00:02:39.090> starting<00:02:39.630> with<00:02:39.780> your<00:02:39.930> thumb

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
straight from starting with your thumb

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.890 
straight from starting with your thumb
to<00:02:40.650> holding<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:42.870> just

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
to holding it like this and then just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.810 
to holding it like this and then just
rotating<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.710> picking<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> speed

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
rotating it and picking up the speed

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.110 
rotating it and picking up the speed
building<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.420> speed<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.970> you're

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
building up the speed but if you're

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.490 
building up the speed but if you're
first<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.570> you're<00:02:48.690> starting<00:02:49.020> out<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.440> is

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
first if you're starting out this is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.990 
first if you're starting out this is
definitely<00:02:50.040> easier<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:50.850> this

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
definitely easier to just go like this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.670 
definitely easier to just go like this
and<00:02:51.180> rotate<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:51.690> fast<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.380> until<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
and rotate as fast as you can until you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.050 
and rotate as fast as you can until you
just<00:02:52.890> until<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.220> builds<00:02:53.460> up<00:02:53.550> enough<00:02:53.730> speed<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
just until it builds up enough speed to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.030 
just until it builds up enough speed to
get<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.420> gyroscope<00:02:54.840> moving<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:55.890> so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
get the gyroscope moving all right so

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.570 
get the gyroscope moving all right so
let's<00:02:56.160> go<00:02:56.310> ahead<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.520> I'll<00:02:56.790> give<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.150> shot

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.300 

come<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:07.820> he's<00:03:08.820> picking<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.390> speed<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:11.040> going

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
come on he's picking up speed I'm going

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
come on he's picking up speed I'm going
to<00:03:11.370> switch<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.209> script<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.810> from<00:03:13.770> here<00:03:13.980> I

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
to switch to the script and from here I

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.880 
to switch to the script and from here I
can<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.370> use<00:03:14.580> my<00:03:14.610> wrist<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.480> rotate<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.080> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
can just use my wrist and rotate it you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.890 
can just use my wrist and rotate it you
want<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.520> if<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.820> ball<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.660> not

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
want to get it so if the ball is not

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.699 
want to get it so if the ball is not
banging<00:03:19.320> against<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.709> blue<00:03:19.980> casing<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.590> can

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
banging against the blue casing you can

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.080 
banging against the blue casing you can
see<00:03:22.830> here<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.280> spinning<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.790> pretty<00:03:23.970> fast

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.699 

and<00:03:28.090> I'll<00:03:28.269> show<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.510> guys<00:03:28.719> how<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:29.079> do<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.469> just

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
and I'll show you guys how I do it just

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.780 
and I'll show you guys how I do it just
you<00:03:29.860> know<00:03:29.950> from<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.370> thumb<00:03:30.609> directly<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.170 

there<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.849> go

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
there you go

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:48.030 
there you go
I'll<00:03:37.359> switch<00:03:37.569> this<00:03:42.329> there<00:03:43.329> goes<00:03:46.439> and<00:03:47.439> picking

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
I'll switch this there goes and picking

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.879 
I'll switch this there goes and picking
speed<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.750> there<00:03:50.049> we<00:03:50.140> go<00:03:50.909> alright

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
speed and there we go alright

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.600 
speed and there we go alright
