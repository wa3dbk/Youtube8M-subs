demonstrate<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:31.280> quickly

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.750 

also<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.440> artificial<00:03:10.160> harmonics<00:03:10.610> and

also the artificial harmonics and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.610 
also the artificial harmonics and
natural<00:03:11.450> harmonics<00:03:11.780> also<00:03:12.020> their<00:03:12.140> sound<00:03:12.380> very

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
natural harmonics also their sound very

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.910 
natural harmonics also their sound very
I<00:03:13.150> don't<00:03:14.150> sound<00:03:14.420> really<00:03:14.600> good<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.960> very<00:03:15.710> easy

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
I don't sound really good and very easy

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440 
I don't sound really good and very easy
to<00:03:16.040> pick<00:03:16.250> them<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.460> with<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.820> active<00:03:17.120> pickups

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
to pick them up with the active pickups

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:50.119 
to pick them up with the active pickups
I'll<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.810> demonstrate<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.410> with

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.910

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.339 
what else yes that comes with a Floyd
Rose<00:03:54.010> original<00:03:54.609> tremor<00:03:54.879> and<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.599> had<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.049> floyd

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
Rose original tremor and I had the floyd

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.239 
Rose original tremor and I had the floyd
rose<00:03:56.499> license<00:03:56.980> tremolo<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.579> my<00:03:57.700> image<00:03:58.030> 250<00:03:58.569> and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:03:59.249 
rose license tremolo on my image 250 and

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.679 
rose license tremolo on my image 250 and
it<00:04:00.249> goes<00:04:00.459> out<00:04:00.609> a<00:04:00.639> tune<00:04:00.849> pretty<00:04:01.180> easily<00:04:01.329> and

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
it goes out a tune pretty easily and

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.110 
it goes out a tune pretty easily and
when<00:04:02.379> you<00:04:02.469> kind<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.739> depressed<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.249> the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
when you kind of depressed it the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.720 
when you kind of depressed it the
strings<00:04:04.480> go<00:04:04.780> flat<00:04:05.109> so<00:04:06.010> with<00:04:06.219> this<00:04:06.250> guitar<00:04:06.489> you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
strings go flat so with this guitar you

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.860 
strings go flat so with this guitar you
don't<00:04:06.879> have<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.090> problem<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.599> can<00:04:07.719> do

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
don't have that problem and you can do

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.009 
don't have that problem and you can do
these<00:04:08.019> kind<00:04:08.290> of<00:04:09.450> fluttering<00:04:10.450> things<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.930> you

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
these kind of fluttering things and you

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.240 
these kind of fluttering things and you
don't<00:04:11.049> have<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.290> worry<00:04:11.469> you<00:04:11.859> can<00:04:12.069> hit<00:04:12.189> it

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
don't have to worry you can hit it

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800 
don't have to worry you can hit it
pretty<00:04:12.400> hard<00:04:12.549> enough<00:04:12.909> to<00:04:13.000> worry<00:04:13.180> about<00:04:13.269> your

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
pretty hard enough to worry about your

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.479 
pretty hard enough to worry about your
guitar<00:04:14.049> going<00:04:14.260> up<00:04:14.349> soon<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.340> let's

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
guitar going up soon so let's

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:48.239 
guitar going up soon so let's
demonstrate<00:04:15.760> that

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:48.249 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:05:01.129 

I

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.779 

yeah<00:05:02.139> that<00:05:02.739> pretty<00:05:02.829> much<00:05:02.919> does<00:05:03.159> it<00:05:03.219> for<00:05:03.579> the

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
yeah that pretty much does it for the

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.449 
yeah that pretty much does it for the
heavy<00:05:04.209> stuff<00:05:04.389> I<00:05:04.509> don't<00:05:04.569> want<00:05:04.779> to<00:05:04.839> show<00:05:05.019> you<00:05:05.079> and

heavy stuff I don't want to show you and

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.959 
heavy stuff I don't want to show you and
just<00:05:06.459> want<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.759> switch<00:05:07.569> it<00:05:07.689> up<00:05:07.749> to<00:05:07.929> clean<00:05:08.969> so

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:12.489 
mg's least I heard before i got this

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:15.389 
mg's least I heard before i got this
guitar<00:05:12.849> that<00:05:13.829> they<00:05:14.829> don't<00:05:14.979> have<00:05:15.009> such<00:05:15.249> good

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:15.399 
guitar that they don't have such good

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.459 
guitar that they don't have such good
cleans<00:05:15.789> but<00:05:16.179> i<00:05:16.389> mean<00:05:16.839> i<00:05:17.019> kind<00:05:17.169> of<00:05:17.259> like<00:05:17.379> the

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
cleans but i mean i kind of like the

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:18.629 
cleans but i mean i kind of like the
cleaners<00:05:17.709> on<00:05:17.799> this<00:05:17.889> guitar<00:05:18.039> i<00:05:18.219> don't<00:05:18.489> really

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
cleaners on this guitar i don't really

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.819 
cleaners on this guitar i don't really
play<00:05:18.939> if<00:05:19.059> they<00:05:19.149> don't<00:05:19.299> clean<00:05:19.449> too<00:05:19.659> often<00:05:19.959> but

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:20.829 
play if they don't clean too often but

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:22.529 
play if they don't clean too often but
just<00:05:21.069> to<00:05:21.399> demonstrate<00:05:21.759> what<00:05:22.149> it<00:05:22.179> sounds<00:05:22.479> like

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
just to demonstrate what it sounds like

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.839 
just to demonstrate what it sounds like
I<00:05:22.749> think<00:05:22.929> the<00:05:22.989> cleans<00:05:23.199> are<00:05:23.319> fine<00:05:23.610> this<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:24.699> the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
I think the cleans are fine this is the

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:33.670 
I think the cleans are fine this is the
bridge<00:05:25.299> pickup

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.770 

and<00:05:34.680> then

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.510 

hey

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
hey

00:05:44.520 --> 00:06:07.810 
hey
it's<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.669> neck<00:05:45.850> pickup

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.140 

and<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:09.590> is<00:06:09.830> just<00:06:10.100> another<00:06:10.370> thing<00:06:10.670> with<00:06:10.910> the

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
and this is just another thing with the

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:32.860 
and this is just another thing with the
clean<00:06:11.570> pick<00:06:11.780> up

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.440 
I'm playing I have to go up switch it
quickly<00:06:56.130> and<00:06:56.280> then<00:06:56.430> come<00:06:56.670> back<00:06:56.700> to<00:06:56.940> plank<00:06:57.180> so

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
quickly and then come back to plank so

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.430 
quickly and then come back to plank so
it's<00:06:57.600> a<00:06:57.630> little<00:06:57.750> bit<00:06:57.870> annoying<00:06:58.080> to<00:06:58.230> switch

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
it's a little bit annoying to switch

it's a little bit annoying to switch
this<00:06:58.860> one<00:06:59.100> I<00:06:59.310> actually<00:06:59.730> looked<00:07:00.150> for<00:07:00.330> that

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360

so what I'm playing I just use my pinky
and<00:07:05.550> I<00:07:05.610> switch<00:07:05.880> it<00:07:06.000> easily<00:07:06.480> so<00:07:07.470> I'll<00:07:07.740> just

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
and I switch it easily so I'll just

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.160 
and I switch it easily so I'll just
demonstrate<00:07:08.010> how<00:07:08.640> easy<00:07:09.360> it<00:07:09.570> is<00:07:09.660> to<00:07:09.720> do<00:07:09.990> while

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170 
demonstrate how easy it is to do while

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:20.879

a thousand bucks so I thought it was a
great<00:07:30.289> value<00:07:30.589> actually<00:07:30.949> for<00:07:31.219> the<00:07:31.279> money<00:07:31.459> and<00:07:31.669> I
