army<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.720> I<00:00:03.810> haven't<00:00:04.200> done<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.680> these

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
army and I haven't done one of these

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950

since a year and a half ago and I
figured<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.410> time<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.250> because

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
figured it was time for one in because

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.430 
figured it was time for one in because
it's<00:00:08.880> grown<00:00:09.150> significantly<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.900> before

matted a knot everything individually my

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.240 
matted a knot everything individually my
good<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.610> let's<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.390> ahead<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.869> started

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
good but let's go ahead and get started

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.170 
good but let's go ahead and get started
alright<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> figured<00:01:30.060> it'd<00:01:30.150> be

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
alright so I kind of figured it'd be

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.460 
alright so I kind of figured it'd be
best<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> take<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> camera<00:01:31.140> off<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.320> tripod

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
best to take the camera off the tripod

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
best to take the camera off the tripod
because<00:01:32.130> she<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.030> trying<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> a

covenant army for a while I'm getting

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.749 
covenant army for a while I'm getting
rid<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.169> 25%<00:04:52.949> of<00:04:53.009> it<00:04:53.099> so<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.310> next<00:04:53.340> time<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.639> do

rid of 25% of it so the next time I do
cover<00:04:54.060> an<00:04:54.180> army<00:04:54.389> will<00:04:54.630> be<00:04:55.130> significantly
