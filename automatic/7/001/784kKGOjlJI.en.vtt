have got to go all out to try to win

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.929 
have got to go all out to try to win
this<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.189> can't<00:01:23.400> afford<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
this but they can't afford to be in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700 
this but they can't afford to be in
breakfast<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.720> they've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.439> away

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
breakfast but they've got to take away

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
breakfast but they've got to take away
through<00:01:26.009> three<00:01:26.369> points<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
through three points and I think it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.850 
through three points and I think it's
going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.840> difficult<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.350> because

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
going to be difficult for because

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
going to be difficult for because
they're<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.670> against<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> side

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
they're going to be up against the side

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
they're going to be up against the side
with<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:31.259> firm<00:01:31.530> support<00:01:32.100> behind<00:01:32.250> them

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
with a really firm support behind them

moderately<00:01:40.320> successful<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:41.070> their<00:01:41.250> standards

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
moderately successful by their standards

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.359

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
play very well under pressure and now

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260 
play very well under pressure and now
this<00:01:46.829> game<00:01:47.040> could<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.399> either<00:01:47.579> way<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.090> could

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
this game could go either way it could

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.760 
this game could go either way it could
go<00:01:48.390> through<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> overall<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> under<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
go through the overall the under two and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.170 
go through the overall the under two and
a<00:01:49.920> half<00:01:50.040> goals<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a half goals but which one are you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780 
a half goals but which one are you
leaning<00:01:51.360> towards<00:01:52.100> I'm<00:01:53.100> leaning<00:01:53.399> towards<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
leaning towards I'm leaning towards it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850 
leaning towards I'm leaning towards it
being<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.110> game<00:01:55.320> could<00:01:55.560> quite

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
being over I think this game could quite

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.789 
being over I think this game could quite
easily<00:01:56.040> work<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> tool<00:01:57.659> drawer<00:01:58.170> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
easily work out to be a tool drawer so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.929 
easily work out to be a tool drawer so
my<00:01:59.340> view<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> overs<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.729> one

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
my view is go for the overs on this one

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
my view is go for the overs on this one
and<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.140> well<00:02:04.290> when<00:02:04.380> you've

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and you don't think as well when you've

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
and you don't think as well when you've
got<00:02:04.649> sort<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.860> two<00:02:05.159> teams<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:06.000> we

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
got sort of two teams that I think we

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.399 
got sort of two teams that I think we
were<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.840> attack<00:02:07.229> from

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
were going to see a lot of attack from

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.630 
were going to see a lot of attack from
here<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
here you don't thing that will kind of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.249 
here you don't thing that will kind of
cancel<00:02:09.000> each<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.110> see

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
cancel each other out and we could see

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.730 
cancel each other out and we could see
the<00:02:10.410> under<00:02:10.619> two<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.920> half<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:12.319> think

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the under two and a half I think

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.320 
the under two and a half I think
it<00:02:13.890> got<00:02:14.100> two<00:02:14.310> teams<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> get

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
it got two teams that are going to get

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
it got two teams that are going to get
to<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.960> be<00:02:16.170> quiet<00:02:16.200> attack<00:02:16.740> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
to go out there and be quiet attack a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.490 
to go out there and be quiet attack a
mind<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.820> think<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.390> tends<00:02:18.810> towards

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
mind it and I think that tends towards

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410 
mind it and I think that tends towards
more<00:02:20.070> shots<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.550> goal<00:02:20.580> therefore<00:02:21.270> more

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
more shots on goal therefore more

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
more shots on goal therefore more
opportunities<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.020> score<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.370> you've<00:02:23.610> got

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
opportunities to score so if you've got

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.850 
opportunities to score so if you've got
two<00:02:24.210> signs<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.750> are<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> go

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
two signs that are really going to go

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.550 
two signs that are really going to go
for<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.450> wouldn't<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.630> betting<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> unders

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
for it I wouldn't be betting the unders

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680 
for it I wouldn't be betting the unders
I<00:02:28.740> say<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.370> were<00:02:29.490> looking<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.880> teams<00:02:30.480> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
I say if you were looking at teams that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.290 
I say if you were looking at teams that
unknown<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.530> very<00:02:32.040> much<00:02:32.280> defensive<00:02:33.030> play

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
unknown the very much defensive play

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.090 
unknown the very much defensive play
when<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.780> need<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.110> win<00:02:34.260> again<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:34.950> you're

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
when they need to win again if you're

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.890 
when they need to win again if you're
trying<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.340> hit<00:02:35.490> sides<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> break<00:02:36.240> then

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
trying to hit sides on the break then

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.150 
trying to hit sides on the break then
that<00:02:37.260> might<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.560> where<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.800> were<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:37.920> to
