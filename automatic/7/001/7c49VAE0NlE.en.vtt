 how to export a flash video with a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 high quality sound and because you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.529
 they know that when you are testing a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.179
 video for example in the case of this one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'm going to open this flash animation that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 what I'm teaching to do in another 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.079
 video can already be shown here 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.079

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.339
 it's like very easy 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 is to export it in a high sound 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.670
 quality let's file or if you have it in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.170
 Spanish the file will be going to export 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.610
 export mobile is not export movie 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 we choose a man and we are going to put 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.410
 huber his fans 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.250
 save and here this will not come out 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 window and I am currently 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.640
 exporting with macromedia flash 8 the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.480
 another one in the next versions is going to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480
 do something similar 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.470
 you come just leave or you are in this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.500
 part always quality and we upload it to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.140
 100% because it is the image quality gpg 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 what's exported here says audio you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.920
 to mp3 to 16 kilobytes for a mono mode 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.670
 what we are going to do is this we are going to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.789
 change instead of 169 instead of 16 what 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.899
 they change to 160 in peace we are going to put it in 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.090
 time as the best so there is already and here 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.710
 let's do exactly the same 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 already 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.800
 these two things we leave them is the same 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.410
 this I think can not be put in 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 outside but here there is nothing 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.750
 because you can not put this and here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 you put it ok and the video starts to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.050
 export now let's see how it changes 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.130
 this may take a little longer 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.800
 because remember that you are 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.880
 transforming that also here I am 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.720
 rescuing a hard drive they asked me 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.540
 there it is that it is ready already we explained it 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 here local course are the stretches 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 the video of those two megaphones 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.110
 you can see the sound are my 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.110
 sins 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.530
 You said you were already involved 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.420
 there it is because one of you 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.459
 I had asked him to teach him how 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.670
 export but I decided to do it in a 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.590
 video apart so they can go testing 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.080
 and do not get discouraged if the sound of 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.150
 resonate a little strange 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.060
