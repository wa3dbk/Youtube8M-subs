00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 ah 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.990
 very good to all and good here you 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.800
 I bring a new map for minecraft and 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.320
 good as you see is a map of pacman and 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.390
 well what it was to be simulated a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.089
 payment game although good is going to have 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.550
 some modifications well let's 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.349
 start reading good the game is similar 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.210
 to the pac man game but it contains 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.800
 some differences first the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.989
 ghosts are replaced by zombies 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 second the diamonds are the points is 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.760
 third if you take a sword 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.670
 you should not hit the zombies with it the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.289
 fourth if you take all the diamonds the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.800
 level will restart but perfect 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.620
 your score will not play in 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.649
 facebook and do not destroy or put 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.500
 blocks will remain under which the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.940
 speak good as you see here the diamond 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.510
 would start and good the 3 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.510
 one 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.020
 and good we hoped a bit and ready 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.240
 As you can see, these would be like little dots 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.730
 yellows of the pacman and well let's 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.440
 start collecting everything from before 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.910
 I do not know if you listen to it but today 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.550
 well and here 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.670
 one zombie sounds 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.250
 we are going to have this strength so that if 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 we take ourselves with the zombies no more be 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.580
 zampar supports him I am and he is already 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.080
 likewise the zombies with a single blow 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.080
 what awaits us 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.610
 blow disputes 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.770
 well let's try it again and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.230
 good as you see this is the room as 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.960
 of the rest so to speak here I knew 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.910
 our kind tomb we already knew for 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.910
 send our score and play again 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.319
 Well, now we're going to talk 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.359
 remember that you can not play in baseball 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.829
 because otherwise we would not have the zombies 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.459
 then well it would not make sense 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.459
 play it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.730
 well this on the right sides 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.590
 left up and down we will have 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.989
 portals is to say that if we step on them we 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.790
 they will transport to the opposite side if I 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.709
 floor by right to send next 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.709
 left and so on 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.880
 good as he came, he got 155 points and 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.740
 then already surpass what would be the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:03:00.380
 standard of the same thing that is the one that did 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:00.380
 the creator of this wanted to show before 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.080
 good we continue 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.080
 looking for the mind 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.420
 good 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.420
 now 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.380
 the fucking forces are over 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.240
 well, they already understood the dynamics 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.250
 I hope your games are the most 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.200
 I'm going to leave the magician 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.730
 the description of the video and well 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.730
 see you next goodbye
