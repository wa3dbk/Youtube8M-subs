00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.440
 dear spectators at sun and heat 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.480
 Could us in the last days and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.769
 weeks but get used to it well now 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 the nature is still a tooth and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 It is sultry hot why is that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.900
 So high has seen that for this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.970
 sunshine and summery 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.500
 Temperatures but not hot heard 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.870
 had worried draws a me 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 back in northern europe and thus makes room 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.950
 for this deep west of the British 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.810
 island and this deep leads in one 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.189
 western to southern current play 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.510
 Hot air masses to Germany 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 that expresses itself even today 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.000
 day there expect us to the 30th 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 Full temperature complete 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 mainly on the north and east coast in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 southwest we reach only 35 degrees 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.989
 the perceived temperature will be 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 clearly puts it in the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.840
 next night it barely cools that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
 means airing does not bring that way anymore 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 much because these values are between 19 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.969
 and 15 degrees reach tomorrow day 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.739
 re-spread the 30 degree mark in 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.990
 Hamburg is expected for 30 in the southwest 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.920
 even 34 at the Pomeranian 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.720
 The Baltic coast will only be 22 to 24 degrees 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 because here comes the wind from the northeast 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.979
 that means from the sea and the east is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.030
 a little cooler the felt 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.070
 temperature is higher 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.350
 that means for the affected areas 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.470
 speak from emsland down to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 Middle Franconia and Lake Constance are 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 already she issued to the alarm 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.770
 The current warning situation you can 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.150
 always under weather conditions de track 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 There you will also find district 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.490
 specific warning goes on next day 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 It's warm to hot but on Wednesday 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.439
 changes this trouble-free situation 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.290
 but there could be me from the southwest 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.150
 partly strong is strong thunderstorms 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 the bones are outrageous 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.159
 this width is not only gradually decreasing 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 they are to the east and northeast from there 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.020
 that would be thursday together 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.570
 west will look more beautiful on friday yes 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.579
 pretty friendly weather only in the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.409
 extreme west are a few showers 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.060
 possible but the temperatures remain 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.550
 reach high 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.179
 but still quite common 30 degrees in the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.510
 southwest 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.620
 33 to 34 degrees on Friday again with it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.599
 I wish a nice one 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.760
 Do not make her too much this week 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.680
 outside and drink them neatly up 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
