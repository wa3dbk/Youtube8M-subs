 on the consoles 9 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.550
 Percent minimization of millions of years 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.339
 in Poland 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.969
 Percent long steady says Kain Transformer yes it is not a transfer 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.699
 Marco r just easier to 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:15.969
 Mr. Sammer here 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.300
 Hirner forward Heinrich's title had children's toys because 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.009
 so nice knobbly and round 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 you see in front 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.019
 Author Taxi 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.020
 View as percent as I said very much 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.020
 Culture is going to be in this form 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.450
 very funny 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 this clear showcases compressed the SMEs fourth and what to draw 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.720
 lay back 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.990
 the dizziness flew only install it will turn 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 the policy should not be decent 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.399
 everything 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.220
 Here you can see on the 7th 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.030
 Classic saved 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340
 okay okay 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.730
 yes I heard that there is no transformation pot 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.590
 Of course today it will not show "service just as stink-normal 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.470
 Zero fifteen car value 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080
 the Bernese too boring 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.770
 that has something 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.870
 it already has what it can transform 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 and that's pretty much sued actually 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.040
 suddenly last 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 the side view works the depth level 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.580
 down four new stairs 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.440
 Tara is committed, it is still possible 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 a little bit more about his taxi stand 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.270
 So that's so crazy so unanimous was yes solved 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.620
 comparing the phone involved 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.320
 here you can see after board century newsman of the speaker labs 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.360
 are 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.730
 No of that 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.010
 Fox they see the taxi driver protecting the taxi center 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.470
 here you can see 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.050
 One-way ticket costs around five euros or round trip costs ten 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.650
 Euro salt childlike 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.780
 here you can see in March of German Studies but still 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.679
 pretty funny and every day Sixt 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.089
 or what else is the staircase here? 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.419
 the municipalities in Trier 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.699
 So go for a kind of mini-game station China Shenhua 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.900
 you can see that happens 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.259
 Jamie never 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.239
 Mechler Zion I do not know where Lost really belongs 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.239
 but what more interesting was the manufacturer 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:44.239
 I do not think that now you sit on the comic essential point around 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.199
 finally see for yourself 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
 namely the 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.899
 a measure the blue box 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.909
 made for Asus 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.409
 that is now facts and I hear Kasemi Komi not uninteresting 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.339
 Much more important is to do punching means Lichtenfels search 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 namely Kacar 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.369
 Life has Kaka rights to it, which I find very interesting 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.299
 more 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.029
 Percent at 2 percent aka 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.190
 Ulrich Schmitz 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.749
 and like Japan 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.749
 Percent of that I again from Asghar a comment i 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.249
 I do not know about cocoa but who the leading Mur 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.989

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.150
 not flowing was like him Kaka's Alonso I'll say so 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.509
 Kacar stands 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.019
 the Transformers 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.099
 taken over in Japan and the races of Hasbro and mostly new 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.099
 were produced on behalf of 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.479
 Hasbro So Day Arrow and hate poses always say differences 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.029
 and we love each other 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.029
 Taka teacher 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.659
 Japanese manufacturer of transformers 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.649
 this is the connection 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.729
 so seen Fanny's forehand while so I have the thing in my hand 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.729
 worked on the beginning so rehearsing the GAK already cool so safe taxi station 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:14.649
 transformed 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.229
 and then I still had in my head 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.639
 Mastered all our cares to Dakar I must smile Bruni 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.999

 we have fairly short leaves fellows no dissent do not say 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.240
 Whatever the first half of the year, Euro extra for this per cent, Europe will rather lead him 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.710
 Germany was manufactured because easy ride in Germany 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 the subway wants the euro 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.939
 Nick Reilly made for Germany 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.240
 Armor Relations this 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.159
 Mr. incredible luck 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.159
 henceforth, questionable for the game 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.180
 the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.279
