00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
still had a few boxes left I think this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.390 
still had a few boxes left I think this
is<00:00:16.650> box<00:00:16.859> number<00:00:17.010> 5<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.660> remember<00:00:18.990> correctly

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400

last<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:20.760> both<00:00:21.060> had<00:00:21.270> Pedroia's<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.170> them<00:00:22.760> last

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
last two both had Pedroia's in them last

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
last two both had Pedroia's in them last
box<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.539> got<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.880> black<00:00:27.019> redemption<00:00:28.189> patch

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
box I got at a black redemption patch

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.830 
box I got at a black redemption patch
auto<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.240> Pedroia<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> being<00:00:31.800> redeemed

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
auto of Pedroia that is being redeemed

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.150 
auto of Pedroia that is being redeemed
that's<00:00:33.840> number<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.200> five<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:34.829> pretty

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that's number two five so that's pretty

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.280 
that's number two five so that's pretty
sweet<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.390> box<00:00:36.570> before<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.050> had<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
sweet and the box before that had a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.160 
sweet and the box before that had a
Pedroia<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.340> Middlebrooks<00:00:38.399> motto<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.899> well

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Pedroia and Middlebrooks motto as well

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
Pedroia and Middlebrooks motto as well
so<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> guess<00:00:41.160> Pedroia<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:42.000> guy<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so I guess Pedroia is my guy for this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.209 
so I guess Pedroia is my guy for this
one<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.559> couple<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.399> noted<00:00:46.010> we<00:00:47.010> got

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
still probably from the same case that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.110 
still probably from the same case that
the<00:00:50.280> other<00:00:50.370> boxes<00:00:50.820> were<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> go
