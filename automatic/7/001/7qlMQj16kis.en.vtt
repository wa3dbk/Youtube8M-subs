right 9 i'll show you those combinations
in<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> moment<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.390> let's<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.899> started

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in just a moment so let's get started

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.889 
in just a moment so let's get started
first<00:00:41.660> let's<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> quick<00:00:43.170> look<00:00:43.320> around<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
first let's take a quick look around it

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
first let's take a quick look around it
fly<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:47.780> feast<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:49.050> eyes<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:50.180> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
fly up so you can feast your eyes on the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:06.730 
fly up so you can feast your eyes on the
complete<00:00:51.660> build

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.800 

you'll<00:01:07.610> notice<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:07.939> there<00:01:08.180> are<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.329> total<00:01:08.540> of

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
you'll notice that there are a total of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.469 
you'll notice that there are a total of
seven<00:01:09.409> levers<00:01:12.460> each<00:01:13.460> lever<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:13.909> connected<00:01:14.360> to

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
seven levers each lever is connected to

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.630 
seven levers each lever is connected to
a<00:01:14.509> dedicated<00:01:15.020> redstone<00:01:15.560> wire<00:01:15.799> which<00:01:16.280> connects

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
a dedicated redstone wire which connects

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.969 
a dedicated redstone wire which connects
to<00:01:16.790> only<00:01:16.939> one<00:01:17.210> piston<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.229> design<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.710> fairly

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
to only one piston the design is fairly

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.980 
to only one piston the design is fairly
compact<00:01:19.549> which<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.119> an<00:01:20.240> important<00:01:20.630> element<00:01:20.720> in

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
compact which is an important element in

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.289 
compact which is an important element in
my<00:01:21.140> designs<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:22.430> design<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:22.789> a<00:01:22.939> lot<00:01:23.149> more

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
my designs this design is a lot more

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.210 
my designs this design is a lot more
resource<00:01:23.780> friendly<00:01:24.229> than<00:01:24.799> my<00:01:24.979> previous

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
resource friendly than my previous

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.429 
resource friendly than my previous
automated<00:01:25.970> design<00:01:26.299> yet<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.080> has<00:01:27.229> more

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
automated design yet it has more

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.249 
automated design yet it has more
variability<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:29.119> let's<00:01:29.270> get<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.450> good<00:01:29.659> angle<00:01:29.960> on

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
variability so let's get a good angle on

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.690 
variability so let's get a good angle on
the<00:01:30.350> wiring<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.039> can<00:01:31.250> pause<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the wiring so that you can pause the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.130 
the wiring so that you can pause the
video<00:01:31.820> or<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> screen<00:01:32.810> capture<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.869> move

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
video or do a screen capture just move

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:47.060 
video or do a screen capture just move
over<00:01:36.470> here<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:40.459> should<00:01:40.670> be<00:01:40.819> perfect

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 

hey<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> other<00:01:47.940> side<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> mirrored<00:01:48.780> copy<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
hey the other side is a mirrored copy of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
hey the other side is a mirrored copy of
this<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> exception<00:01:50.370> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.760> lever

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this one with the exception of the lever

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
this one with the exception of the lever
that<00:01:51.240> connects<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> wire<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.860> runs

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that connects to the wire that runs

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
that connects to the wire that runs
underneath<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> look<00:01:55.260> over

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
underneath so we don't need to look over

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.219 
underneath so we don't need to look over
there<00:01:55.770> however<00:01:56.280> let's<00:01:56.490> take<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.300> look<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.870> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
there however let's take a look at the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.950 
there however let's take a look at the
wire<00:01:58.729> underneath

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.230 

single<00:02:08.800> repeater<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.399> points<00:02:09.729> at<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.880> back

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
single repeater that points at the back

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.540 
single repeater that points at the back
piston

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:27.110 

and<00:02:16.910> now<00:02:17.870> let's<00:02:18.110> take<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.380> look<00:02:18.470> inside

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.350 

as<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.159> sand<00:02:29.610> blocks<00:02:29.879> around<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
as you see sand blocks around the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
as you see sand blocks around the
enchanting<00:02:30.810> table<00:02:31.019> these<00:02:31.500> sand<00:02:31.830> blocks<00:02:32.099> are

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
enchanting table these sand blocks are

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.000 
enchanting table these sand blocks are
what<00:02:32.459> control<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.030> enchanted<00:02:33.569> levels<00:02:34.010> I'm

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
what control the enchanted levels I'm

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
what control the enchanted levels I'm
using<00:02:35.220> sand<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:35.909> gravel<00:02:36.269> could<00:02:36.420> also<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:36.870> used

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
using sand but gravel could also be used

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.050 
using sand but gravel could also be used
the<00:02:37.709> idea<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.159> we<00:02:38.400> want<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.640> block<00:02:38.879> that

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the idea is that we want a block that

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.789 
the idea is that we want a block that
will<00:02:39.209> fall<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.780> regular<00:02:40.200> piston<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
will fall when the regular piston is

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.220 
will fall when the regular piston is
retracted<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:42.480> design<00:02:42.659> we<00:02:43.019> aren't

retracted and this design we aren't

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
retracted and this design we aren't
moving<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.590> bookcases<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.549> my<00:02:44.670> previous

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
moving the bookcases as in my previous

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.479 
moving the bookcases as in my previous
design<00:02:45.599> instead<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:46.769> were<00:02:46.860> blocking<00:02:47.159> them

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
design instead we were blocking them

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.119 
design instead we were blocking them
from<00:02:47.519> being<00:02:47.879> used<00:02:48.150> by<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.420> enchanting<00:02:48.930> table

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
from being used by the enchanting table

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.710 
from being used by the enchanting table
by<00:02:50.129> raising<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.879> side<00:02:51.120> blocks<00:02:51.450> we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
by raising one of the side blocks we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.170 
by raising one of the side blocks we
block<00:02:51.989> out<00:02:52.200> two<00:02:52.470> bookcases<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:53.700> raising<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
block out two bookcases and by raising a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.259 
block out two bookcases and by raising a
corner<00:02:54.480> block<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.930> block<00:02:55.170> out<00:02:55.349> six<00:02:55.709> bookcases

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
corner block we block out six bookcases

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.970 
corner block we block out six bookcases
we<00:02:57.269> can<00:02:57.420> therefore<00:02:57.599> use<00:02:58.110> combinations<00:02:58.500> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
we can therefore use combinations of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.039 
we can therefore use combinations of
blocks<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.549> achieve<00:02:59.849> various<00:03:00.209> level<00:03:00.599> ranges

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
blocks to achieve various level ranges

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.559 
blocks to achieve various level ranges
for<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.829> signs<00:03:02.069> outside<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.180> let's<00:03:03.359> take

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
for the signs outside so let's take

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:19.270 
for the signs outside so let's take
another<00:03:03.690> look<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.109> those

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.699 

for<00:03:19.850> example<00:03:20.300> if<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.840> are<00:03:20.959> interested<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.500> an

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
for example if we are interested in an

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.699 
for example if we are interested in an
enchantment<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.610> range<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:23.000> 6<00:03:23.300> 235<00:03:23.780> we

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
enchantment in the range of 6 235 we

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.500 
enchantment in the range of 6 235 we
would<00:03:24.980> flip<00:03:25.250> all<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> levers<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:25.910> have<00:03:26.330> that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
would flip all the levers that have that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.440 
would flip all the levers that have that
range<00:03:26.720> listed<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:28.340> let's<00:03:28.580> do<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.240> and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
range listed so let's do just that and

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:46.410 
range listed so let's do just that and
verify<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.319> works

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.309 

okay<00:03:47.080> so<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:48.160> ones<00:03:48.390> they<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.420> 6<00:03:49.840> 235

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
okay so all of the ones they have 6 235

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.240 
okay so all of the ones they have 6 235
listed<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.459> been<00:03:51.790> activated<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:56.830> can<00:03:57.040> see

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
listed have been activated you can see

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
listed have been activated you can see
the<00:03:57.430> block<00:03:57.670> configuration<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.489> we<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.880> nines

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
the block configuration so we have nines

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.970 
the block configuration so we have nines
and<00:04:04.720> 21<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.890> as<00:04:06.760> we<00:04:07.569> go<00:04:07.750> through<00:04:08.170> we<00:04:08.440> should

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
and 21 and as we go through we should

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:23.780 
and 21 and as we go through we should
only<00:04:09.250> see<00:04:09.930> ranges<00:04:10.930> between<00:04:11.080> 6<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.950> 35

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.790 

I<00:04:23.880> still<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:24.810> wish<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.200> there<00:04:25.350> was<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.590> way

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
I still really wish that there was a way

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.270 
I still really wish that there was a way
that<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:26.130> could<00:04:26.430> just<00:04:26.490> plug<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:28.280> particular

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
that we could just plug in a particular

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.520 
that we could just plug in a particular
value<00:04:29.730> or<00:04:30.740> even<00:04:31.740> values<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:33.510> choose<00:04:33.810> from<00:04:34.080> this

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
value or even values to choose from this

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.820 
value or even values to choose from this
is<00:04:34.770> still<00:04:35.550> kind<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:35.850> clunky<00:04:36.120> but<00:04:36.560> this<00:04:37.560> gives

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
is still kind of clunky but this gives

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.150 
is still kind of clunky but this gives
us<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.220> lot<00:04:38.430> more<00:04:38.460> control<00:04:39.000> by<00:04:39.720> using<00:04:40.620> this<00:04:40.920> sort

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
us a lot more control by using this sort

00:04:41.160 --> 00:05:02.189 
us a lot more control by using this sort
of<00:04:41.250> setup

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.180 

so<00:05:03.199> as<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.440> can<00:05:03.530> see<00:05:03.740> I've<00:05:03.860> written<00:05:04.040> the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
so as you can see I've written the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.129 
so as you can see I've written the
ranges<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.910> signs<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.360> help<00:05:05.660> me<00:05:05.780> remember

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
ranges on the signs to help me remember

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.990 
ranges on the signs to help me remember
but<00:05:06.590> over<00:05:06.800> time<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.340> should<00:05:07.400> be<00:05:07.639> able<00:05:07.760> to

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
but over time you should be able to

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.120 
but over time you should be able to
memorize<00:05:08.180> them<00:05:08.660> yourself<00:05:09.080> or<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.770> can<00:05:09.919> always

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
memorize them yourself or you can always

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.879 
memorize them yourself or you can always
do<00:05:10.280> some<00:05:10.490> quick<00:05:10.729> math<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.620> there<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.710> have<00:05:12.770> it

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
do some quick math and there you have it

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.950 
do some quick math and there you have it
a<00:05:13.160> resource<00:05:13.729> friendly<00:05:14.210> highly<00:05:14.600> variable
