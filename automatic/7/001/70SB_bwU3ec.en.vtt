hi my name is Flo and Feliz and welcome
to<00:00:09.900> part<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.950> sound<00:00:11.190> examples<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
to part two of the sound examples of the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.959 
to part two of the sound examples of the
base<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.450> activity<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.549> today<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.580> want<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
base which activity I today I want to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.730 
base which activity I today I want to
show<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.480> easy<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
show you how easy it can be when you

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.349 
show you how easy it can be when you
have<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> switch<00:00:17.310> between<00:00:17.490> instruments<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
have to switch between instruments on a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720 
have to switch between instruments on a
gig<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.590> base<00:00:19.830> which<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.430> connect

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
gig with the base which you can connect

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.849 
gig with the base which you can connect
to<00:00:20.910> instruments<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.109> able<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> dial

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to instruments and you are able to dial

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.500 
to instruments and you are able to dial
in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> perfect<00:00:23.160> balance<00:00:23.910> between<00:00:24.000> both

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
in the perfect balance between both

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.560 
in the perfect balance between both
sounds<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.140> volumes<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
sounds and volumes so you don't have to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
sounds and volumes so you don't have to
adjust<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.529> amp<00:00:28.710> anymore<00:00:29.130> or

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
adjust the two of your amp anymore or

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
adjust the two of your amp anymore or
unplug<00:00:30.060> any<00:00:30.300> cable<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.929> order<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> change<00:00:31.560> in

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
unplug any cable in order to change in

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.220 
unplug any cable in order to change in
an<00:00:31.830> instrument<00:00:32.630> for<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.780> demo<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.200> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
an instrument for this demo I have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
an instrument for this demo I have
connected<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> fretted<00:00:35.219> base<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> true

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
connected the fretted base to the true

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.400 
connected the fretted base to the true
sound<00:00:36.300> channel<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> base<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
sound channel of the base which and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
sound channel of the base which and
fretless<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.489> channel<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.930> where<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> used<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
fretless to channel a where I used to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.790 
fretless to channel a where I used to
preamp<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> thank<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.079> as<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
preamp and thank you as you can see I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.590 
preamp and thank you as you can see I
just<00:00:43.860> added<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.489> bit<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> treble

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just added a bit of treble

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619 
just added a bit of treble
I<00:00:45.629> left<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> upper<00:00:46.620> mids<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:47.070> zero<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.610> took<00:00:48.329> out

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I left the upper mids at zero I took out

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
I left the upper mids at zero I took out
a<00:00:48.660> booming<00:00:49.050> frequency<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> low<00:00:51.000> mids<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a booming frequency with a low mids and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.010 
a booming frequency with a low mids and
added<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.559> low-end<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.600> also<00:00:54.600> turned<00:00:54.960> down

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
added some low-end I also turned down

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
added some low-end I also turned down
the<00:00:55.289> volume<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.489> practice

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the volume a bit because the practice

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
the volume a bit because the practice
has<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> slightly<00:00:57.600> higher<00:00:57.960> output<00:00:58.140> than<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
has a slightly higher output than the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
has a slightly higher output than the
other<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.190> as<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> sound<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.899> have

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
other one as for the sound I have

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
other one as for the sound I have
connected<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.770> pedal<00:01:02.160> board<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> used<00:01:02.879> both

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
connected my pedal board and I used both

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
connected my pedal board and I used both
effect<00:01:03.629> loops<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.019> base<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.010> all

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
effect loops of the base which so all

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
effect loops of the base which so all
the<00:01:05.460> effects<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> signal<00:01:06.780> path<00:01:07.250> which

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the effects are in the signal path which

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
the effects are in the signal path which
actually<00:01:09.000> doesn't<00:01:09.210> matter<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually doesn't matter at all as you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
actually doesn't matter at all as you
will<00:01:10.380> hear<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.280> sound<00:01:11.460> quality<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.210> bass

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
will hear the sound quality of the bass

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.560 
will hear the sound quality of the bass
which<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.869> still<00:01:13.229> incredible<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
which is still incredible of all the
