00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.510
 so there is second video on 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.119
 harmonization of the major scale in 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.250
 the first we saw how to find the 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.920
 agreements to 310 billion swimmers in 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.330
 this one we will see how to find the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.570
 agreements at 4 are that is to say the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.840
 7th chords always the same we will do 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.910
 an exercise at the scales of C major but 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.410
 the principle we will see will be valid 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.500
 for all the other ranges on it 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.360
 so that's what we found in the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.299
 first video 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.100
 so we had said that like the range 

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.519
 major is a range composed of this 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.110
 note 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.629
 we will be able to find this agreement 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 different these agreements we will 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.440
 numbers and 1.7 Roman numerals 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.930
 which we will call degree first degree 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.369
 second degree etc and we had found that 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.199
 that is, the first chord of a 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:59.860
 major scale will always be an agreement 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.299
 major okay here like and damage 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.070
 hours it will necessarily be damaged 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.740
 the second agreement on a thousand agreement 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 the third leader fourth major one 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.220
 major gain 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 if the minors eficien dine so 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 now we will see we will do the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.910
 same job for 4 chords are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.270
 so we will start with the first 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.760
 agreement 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.140
 we will start from the date of the uncle and 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.430
 first three are the first three 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 Notes is already known since it has the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.640
 did in the first video it was 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 domisse on time then find themselves 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.580
 with an interval of one fifth between 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.280
 two waters and soils and one major piece 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.170
 between back and me that's why we 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.490
 gives a major chord if I add a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.980
 fourth tablecloth always on the same 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.900
 principle that is to say and one in two 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.820
 I will find you the 4th us 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.280
 will be so and we will analyze 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.479
 the interval where is positioned says that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.250
 laugh this note 6 relative 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.010
 to others not so this time to 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.340
 instead of trivializing the interval by 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.320
 report to the departure date that me 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 will give the gap big enough we're going 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.710
 analyze this interval with respect to 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.900
 back which is at the octave what is 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.879
 much easier we look at each other 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.190
 this is located a half tone below 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.580
 the octave so when we have a half 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.110
 your is black of people 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 solo is at its 9th or 7th swimmers so 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.960
 our first agreement is not found 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 it will always be a 7th major agreement is 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.860
 theirs since we are in back tone 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.860
 it will be a 7th day of purchase 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.069
 it is not more complicated than that the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.020
 second agreement so we had found 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.750
 raid salah who gave us an agreement 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.170
 of D minor if I add a fourth 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 note 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.489
 that will give us a rate that will be located 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.620
 at a tone below the octa a note 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.510
 who located india 1 is not going round in 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.110
 under drinking water gives us a 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.220
 seventh so the second agreement will be 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.780
 always a minor but 7th and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.530
 so there in our example it will make a re 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.530
 minor 7th 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.100
 so here we continue now that 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.070
 you know the third principle 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.100
 agreement we had found 806 who will pay the 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.800
 coroner the fourth date will be a true 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.560
 which will be located at a tone below 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.300
 their table so it's the same as for the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.330
 second chord that will give back an agreement 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.330
 minor 7th and there a minor 7th 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.620
 fourth agreement we had found fall 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.909
 teens who gave us a major F 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.230
 fourth date 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:52.720
 it is a friend who is located a half tone 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.980
 below the otam so a half tone in 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.810
 below the delay in lodges just now 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.579
 it gives us a seventh major our 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.379
 fourth string fourth degree this 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.379
 will always be a seventh acord 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.950
 fifth agreement alone if ray that we 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.670
 gave a major agreement 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.890
 this time the fourth date is a 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.900
 acquired to situate a tone below 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.789
 drinking water a turn in either we saw it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.669
 it's a seventh good that's going to give us 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:26.199
 a 7th major ground accord 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.680
 it will be missed like this so be careful 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.710
 do not confuse between single major 7th and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.000
 only 7th major because sometimes we 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.760
 can confuse so that's why in 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.300
 General speaks to you we will speak simply 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.780
 Seventh balance for deep step 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.690
 with the seventh major the sixth 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.900
 okay we found there domi who 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.010
 gave us a minor chord 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.889
 fourth note is a floor that is 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.160
 located a bit below table including 7 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.870
 a seventh is good our sixth 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.930
 six o'clock agreement and will always be a 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.560
 minor chord 7th and there as I am in 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.240
 back tone it will be at the 7th minor 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.940
 and the last chord that we had 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.949
 found waxed family string 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.449
 particular to the diminished agreement since 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:22.630
 has a flat flare between sifa is a 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.570
 minors play between 6 and re fourth 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.210
 possible note and a there that is a tone in 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.699
 below the drinking water which is a 7th 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.260
 so he's going to end up like these 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:38.800
 can be so seventh flat can this so 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.470
 it's a very special decor 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:47.020
 that you will not often use 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.580
 so that's once I understood 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.379
 this principle you are able to 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.789
 find all 7th chords on which 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.009
 you will be able to play your range 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.330
 major when you have to understand 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.330
 it's like the first video is that 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.099
 these agreements are always in the same 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.879
 that is to say that a major range will have 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:06.069
 always for first agreement the agreement of 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.360
 his third major third agreement a 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.039
 minor this third agreement a 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.440
 billion this fourth agreement will be 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.960
 always a seventh fifth fifth 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.940
 agreement adacore seventh system agreements 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.370
 minor 7 and 7th agreement an agreement 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.270
 seventh mild case 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.069
 so once you know by 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.810
 heart it's easy to find all 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.610
 straw chords for example in tone 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.500
 of F major 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:31.569
 the notes of the range of chargers sound 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.940
 how do you think this is so? 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.500
 too much and disagreements kind how his 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.389
 first note 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.539
 hoffa 7th major rae rae single parents 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:48.180
 1:07 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:51.789
 the minor 7-6 9/7 major of ossetes the 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.710
 minors this premise 7th a flat 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.020
 so that's it works in all 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.569
 the tones that are its tones 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.449
 wheel in say 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.729
 so that's so exercised you to find 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.969
 the agreements and in the next 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.349
 videos we will do some exercises for 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:12.719
 priests started to practice war 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.719
 swimmers the good day and good luck
