00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
and the thing actually works you can

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.030 
and the thing actually works you can
plug<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.230> go<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.410> don't<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.769> to

we've<00:00:53.930> got<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:54.260> patent-pending<00:00:54.800> technology

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
we've got this patent-pending technology

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.280 
we've got this patent-pending technology
to<00:00:55.790> enable<00:00:56.120> us<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.270> make<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:56.660> triple<00:00:57.079> disc

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
to enable us to make this triple disc

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.229 
to enable us to make this triple disc
work<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.739> live<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.219> it<00:00:58.430> actually<00:00:58.760> works<00:00:59.000> and

really stand out to you the triple disc
clutch<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.360> really<00:01:05.630> something<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.020> be<00:01:06.140> proud

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
clutch is really something to be proud

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.690 
clutch is really something to be proud
of<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:06.740> been<00:01:06.890> engineered<00:01:07.160> entirely

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
of it's been engineered entirely

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.150 
of it's been engineered entirely
in-house<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.600> brand<00:01:08.930> new<00:01:08.990> design<00:01:09.320> its

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
in-house it's a brand new design its

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.790 
in-house it's a brand new design its
patent-pending<00:01:11.119> technology<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:12.229> like<00:01:12.710> I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
patent-pending technology and like I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.529 
patent-pending technology and like I
said<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.130> design<00:01:13.369> requirement<00:01:14.090> was<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.420> that

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
said the design requirement was so that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.270 
said the design requirement was so that
the<00:01:14.660> converter<00:01:15.020> could<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.289> could<00:01:15.710> be<00:01:15.740> bolted

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the converter could be could be bolted

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.300 
the converter could be could be bolted
in<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.640> actually<00:01:17.000> work<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.740> gonna<00:01:18.920> require

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
in and actually work is it gonna require

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.760 
in and actually work is it gonna require
a<00:01:19.369> lot<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.880> shop<00:01:20.150> time<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.750> get<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:21.140> thing<00:01:21.380> in

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
a lot of shop time to get this thing in

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.440 
a lot of shop time to get this thing in
and<00:01:21.950> running<00:01:22.100> no<00:01:22.490> that's<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.909> beauty<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.270> it

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
and running no that's the beauty of it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.090 
and running no that's the beauty of it
because<00:01:23.869> since<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.320> bolt<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.680> in<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.010> go

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
because since you can bolt it in and go

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.649 
because since you can bolt it in and go
you<00:01:25.159> don't<00:01:25.369> have<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.760> get<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.000> custom<00:01:26.390> tuned

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
you don't have to get it custom tuned

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.630 
you don't have to get it custom tuned
you<00:01:26.840> don't<00:01:26.990> have<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.320> use<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.680> disabled<00:01:28.549> to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
you don't have to use the disabled to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.550 
you don't have to use the disabled to
lock<00:01:28.850> up<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.110> typical

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
lock up it's a it's a typical

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.469 
lock up it's a it's a typical
installation<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.280> converter<00:01:31.610> pretty<00:01:32.030> easy

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
installation of a converter pretty easy

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.760 
installation of a converter pretty easy
who's<00:01:32.659> gonna<00:01:32.780> benefit<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.259> mice<00:01:33.409> from<00:01:33.560> this

who's gonna benefit the mice from this
con<00:01:33.950> technology<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.759> think<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.509> single

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
con technology I think this is a single

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.450

best<00:01:36.080> bang<00:01:36.350> for<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.619> buck<00:01:36.650> for<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.100> Camaro

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
best bang for the buck for the Camaro

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.060 
best bang for the buck for the Camaro
it's<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.060> 7<00:01:38.420> tenths<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.290> second<00:01:39.680> gain<00:01:39.860> in

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
it's a 7 tenths of a second gain in

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770 
it's a 7 tenths of a second gain in

it's really not a hard part to put in
you<00:01:44.450> mentioned<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.049> ball<00:01:45.290> together

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
you mentioned this is a ball together

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.020 
you mentioned this is a ball together
what<00:01:45.799> does<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:45.920> mean<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.640> bolt<00:01:46.880> together

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
what does that mean the bolt together

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.330 
what does that mean the bolt together
really<00:01:47.450> does<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.720> couple<00:01:48.049> of<00:01:48.229> things<00:01:48.500> first<00:01:49.130> of

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
really does a couple of things first of

really does a couple of things first of
all<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.520> way<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:49.790> designed<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.390> anybody<00:01:50.840> can

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
all the way we designed it anybody can

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.480 
all the way we designed it anybody can
take<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.259> apart<00:01:51.500> fold<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.829> back<00:01:51.979> together<00:01:52.159> no

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
take it apart fold it back together no

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.910 
take it apart fold it back together no
special<00:01:52.970> tools<00:01:53.210> required<00:01:53.299> but<00:01:54.229> it'll<00:01:54.650> let<00:01:54.799> you
