00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
scheme tutorial the complementary color

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.899 
scheme tutorial the complementary color
is<00:01:48.720> directly<00:01:49.560> across<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.950> color<00:01:52.950> wheel<00:01:53.299> from

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
is directly across the color wheel from
