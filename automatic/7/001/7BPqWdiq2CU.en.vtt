the political possible political nature
of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.570> attack<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:33.090> my<00:02:34.090> contention<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.840> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
of the attack but my contention is is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.760 
of the attack but my contention is is
that<00:02:36.090> politics<00:02:37.090> aside<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:38.080> was<00:02:38.350> an<00:02:38.500> attack

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
that politics aside this was an attack

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.790 
that politics aside this was an attack
on<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.250> black<00:02:39.640> female<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.360> African<00:02:40.900> descent<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
so we need to follow that and not

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.800 
so we need to follow that and not
