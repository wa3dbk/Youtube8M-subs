00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 days with five stars of ethical gesture 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 the list of all our friendly technicians 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 especially when it's official 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 thirty skiers in fifa 15 and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.920
 frankly it'll tear everything up I know 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 not what you think but I 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.849
 kiffe already so I put you all 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.830
 all the skippers anyway in the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 video they will show as and when 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.980
 measure if you want to put 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 pause to see the stats for example from 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.020
 faithful martinez who will happen all of 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.579
 now 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 do not hesitate to pause all 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.309
 simply but when I go to you 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.809
 give my opinion on all these 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 days with five gesture stars 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 technical then already I'm comedian I 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 am very happy because there are some 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 there are pearls 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 frankly there are pearls there already 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.930
 players who are really 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.000
 extraordinary that really look 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.440
 excellent honestly must say it they 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 have stats that is frankly that he 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 not at all reflect their cards then 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 that they still have five stars of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.100
 technical gesture so it'll be great 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.930
 great fun to play with these players 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 Frankly I have several players 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.570
 will admit to you that I already have in mind 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.549
 make a team 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 of course there is ronaldinho who has 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.700
 is back we are happy we are 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.380
 all happy because ronaldinho 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.939
 it was a player I wanted to buy 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 this is the player I did first 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.600
 every fifa so we are all happy 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 then of course there is chira yes 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 there are players like silva that you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.610
 see on the screen or kelvin for example 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 so it's going to be between those two 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.360
 since it is known the only players 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 on the right side with five stars the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.880
 technical gesture that are brazilian 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 arroyo who looks really excellent 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 assaidi also who in silver player 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 now they will cost very very 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 dear and look at me that will attract yes no 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.310
 but this player is low all degumming in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
 plus it is rated 75th general so everything 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.930
 the world will be able to chopper him into a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 pack 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.710
 frankly it's going to be awesome 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 also hatem ben arfa who does his 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 back with a little less speed 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 we even have straw straws 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.399
 who will blow everything 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 we also have matias fernandez who was 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.299
 present so in this world cup 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.219
 and who will come back on fifa 15 with five 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.049
 mcgeady technical gesture stars with 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.700
 his famous magdi spin we also touched 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.930
 frankly we have players who are 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.829
 really excellent will be able to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.329
 beautiful hybrid 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.979
 douglas costa that looks really 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.869
 exceptional are really players who 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330
 do they make their comeback that make 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.349
 that they are surprised maybe 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.880
 ronaldinho obviously we've seen it too 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.950
 quaresma no but frankly the mates 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.960
 this game fifa 15 looks really already 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.910
 better even better if I can 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.720
 say that like that fifa 14 finally for 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.490
 I do not know what you think 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.900
 Besides, tell me in the comments 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.640
 your favorite players that you fancy 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.620
 from immediately tested with five stars 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.000
 budget technical make me a list 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.230
 simply we also have five neymar 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.580
 technical gesture stars with five 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.440
 bad foot stars that will everything 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.890
 tear him up too and frankly what 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.270
 figure at 15 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.740
 he's going all bombed so I do not know 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.040
 what you think about it compared to its 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.750
 players 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.550
 of course we do not have 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.470
 ibrahimovic ibrahimovic will have everything 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.700
 simply 4 stars of technical gesture 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.680
 so I put you both legends 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.760
 okocha and peeled even though I know that the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 playstation 3 and playstation 4 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 which is a bit of a pity 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.510
 part of microsoft that simply 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.370

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.480
 debates we are here for the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.070
