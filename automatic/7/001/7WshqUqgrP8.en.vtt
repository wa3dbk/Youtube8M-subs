00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
I think as well everyone looking at the

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.780 
I think as well everyone looking at the
money<00:06:28.260> and<00:06:28.320> obviously<00:06:28.710> it's<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:28.890> factor<00:06:29.220> but

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
money and obviously it's a factor but

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.460 
money and obviously it's a factor but
and<00:06:30.060> people<00:06:30.300> said<00:06:30.479> why<00:06:30.630> don't<00:06:30.690> you<00:06:30.870> go<00:06:31.410> to

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
and people said why don't you go to

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.260 
and people said why don't you go to
Toulouse<00:06:31.740> or<00:06:31.919> Claremont<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.460> actually<00:06:33.060> think

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
Toulouse or Claremont I actually think

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.159 
Toulouse or Claremont I actually think
he<00:06:33.390> can<00:06:33.540> be<00:06:33.630> part<00:06:33.720> of<00:06:33.840> something<00:06:33.990> really

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
he can be part of something really

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.839 
he can be part of something really

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
guy it's it's obviously a factor but he

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.160
