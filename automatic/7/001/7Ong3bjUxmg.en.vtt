much like a sync for an iPhone and in
fact<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.490> true<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.000> only<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> iPod

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

fact that's true not only on the iPod
touch<00:01:13.290> itself<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.189> iTunes<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.939> look

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

in iTunes you've got tabs you can set
your<00:01:17.340> syncing<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:18.900> very

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
your syncing one thing that's very

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
your syncing one thing that's very
different<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> iPhone<00:01:20.009> though<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
different from the iPhone though is this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760
