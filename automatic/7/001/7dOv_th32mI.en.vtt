situation you're anxious about is

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.289 
situation you're anxious about is
obviously<00:01:20.320> rewarded<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.490> reward<00:01:21.909> being<00:01:22.150> the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
obviously rewarded the reward being the

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.860 
obviously rewarded the reward being the
reduction<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:23.020> anxiety<00:01:24.090> each<00:01:25.090> time<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.570> avoid

the<00:01:26.020> situation<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:27.190> reward<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.610> being

the situation the reward of being

the situation the reward of being
relieved<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.330> anxiety<00:01:28.870> follows<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:30.400> your

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
relieved of anxiety follows and so your

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.430 
relieved of anxiety follows and so your
behavior<00:01:30.700> gets<00:01:31.180> strengthened<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:31.869> tends<00:01:32.229> to

behavior gets strengthened and tends to

Rochester we practice the process of
desensitization<00:02:21.459> or<00:02:21.670> exposure<00:02:22.629> which<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.560> the

desensitization or exposure which is the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.899 
desensitization or exposure which is the
unlearning<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> connection<00:02:24.790> between
