testing<00:00:20.810> campaign<00:00:22.300> quite<00:00:23.300> interesting<00:00:23.779> like

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
testing campaign quite interesting like

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.939 
testing campaign quite interesting like
this<00:00:24.080> one<00:00:24.290> it's<00:00:24.500> got<00:00:24.710> dual<00:00:25.460> cree<00:00:25.700> xm-l<00:00:26.119> tues

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
this one it's got dual cree xm-l tues

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.900 
this one it's got dual cree xm-l tues
any<00:00:27.949> of<00:00:28.070> these<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.400> now<00:00:28.490> these<00:00:28.640> are<00:00:28.850> the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
any of these and now these are the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.760 
any of these and now these are the
second<00:00:29.270> generation<00:00:29.360> of<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:29.869> cree<00:00:30.140> xm-l<00:00:30.530> so

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
second generation of the cree xm-l so

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.100 
second generation of the cree xm-l so
they're<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.920> little<00:00:31.100> bit<00:00:31.279> brighter<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:32.480> bit

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
they're a little bit brighter a bit

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.400 
they're a little bit brighter a bit
better<00:00:33.350> run<00:00:33.590> times<00:00:33.830> using<00:00:34.129> them<00:00:35.410> obviously

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
better run times using them obviously

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.320 
better run times using them obviously
it's<00:00:36.739> always<00:00:36.980> nice<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.220> these<00:00:37.489> torches<00:00:38.090> to

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's always nice to these torches to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.000 
it's always nice to these torches to
have<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.570> latest<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.020> greatest<00:00:39.290> LEDs<00:00:39.830> in

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
have the latest and greatest LEDs in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.410 
have the latest and greatest LEDs in
there<00:00:41.019> each<00:00:42.019> LED<00:00:42.440> has<00:00:42.769> got<00:00:43.460> high<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:43.850> 900

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
there each LED has got high of 900

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.670 
there each LED has got high of 900
lumens<00:00:45.159> combined<00:00:46.159> there<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.610> turbo<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.680> 1800

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
lumens combined there is a turbo of 1800

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.520 
lumens combined there is a turbo of 1800
lamers<00:00:48.979> and<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.600> it's<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.900> nice<00:00:51.050> bright<00:00:51.290> light

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
lamers and so it's a nice bright light

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.399 
lamers and so it's a nice bright light
this<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.970> wide<00:00:53.180> beam<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.110> your

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
this is the wide beam this is your

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.560 
this is the wide beam this is your
you're<00:00:54.710> throwing<00:00:55.190> spot<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:57.909> it<00:00:58.909> runs<00:00:59.120> off<00:00:59.299> 3

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
you're throwing spot and it runs off 3

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.130 
you're throwing spot and it runs off 3

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
18 650 lithium ions quite cool like this

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.380 
18 650 lithium ions quite cool like this
one<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:03.890> you've<00:01:04.400> got<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:05.140> runtime<00:01:06.140> /<00:01:06.470> LED<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.390> on

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
one so you've got a runtime / LED of on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.550 
one so you've got a runtime / LED of on
high<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:10.280> three<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> half<00:01:11.030> hours

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
high of three and a half hours

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.470 
high of three and a half hours
approximately<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> half<00:01:12.710> hours<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
approximately a half hours and on the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.160 
approximately a half hours and on the
1800<00:01:15.170> lumens<00:01:15.320> you've<00:01:16.250> shot<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.640> runtime<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.390> an

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
1800 lumens you've shot a runtime of an

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.740 
1800 lumens you've shot a runtime of an
hour<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.500> 45<00:01:18.920> minutes<00:01:19.180> there<00:01:20.180> is<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.330> thermal

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
hour and 45 minutes there is a thermal

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.350 
hour and 45 minutes there is a thermal
step<00:01:20.990> down<00:01:21.200> as<00:01:21.320> well<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.830> protect<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:22.910> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
step down as well to protect that the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.770 
step down as well to protect that the
LEDs<00:01:23.990> from<00:01:24.380> OV<00:01:25.030> there's<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.150> battery<00:01:26.330> carrier

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
LEDs from OV there's a battery carrier

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.400 
LEDs from OV there's a battery carrier
you<00:01:27.620> can<00:01:27.650> actually<00:01:27.950> run<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.720> 118<00:01:29.720> 650<00:01:30.290> if

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
you can actually run this on 118 650 if

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.390 
you can actually run this on 118 650 if
you<00:01:30.530> need<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.770> showing<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.100> inside<00:01:37.370> of

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
you need to just showing the inside of

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.190 
you need to just showing the inside of
the<00:01:37.520> head<00:01:37.610> there<00:01:37.820> these<00:01:38.510> are<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.780> contact

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the head there these are the contact

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.450 
the head there these are the contact
points<00:01:41.170> these<00:01:42.170> are<00:01:42.380> slightly<00:01:42.830> strong<00:01:43.130> noted

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
points these are slightly strong noted

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.990 
points these are slightly strong noted
which<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.670> quite<00:01:43.880> nice<00:01:45.250> screw<00:01:46.250> them<00:01:46.340> together

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.540 

now<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.300> will<00:01:50.690> talk<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.170> through<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.040> modes

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
now I will talk you through the modes

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.100 
now I will talk you through the modes
right<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.330> we've<00:01:53.480> got<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.840> there's<00:01:54.800> an<00:01:54.980> eco<00:01:55.520> a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
right so we've got a there's an eco a

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.180 
right so we've got a there's an eco a
low<00:01:57.110> medium<00:01:58.040> high<00:01:59.140> so<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> eco<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.680> 10<00:02:00.980> lumens

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
low medium high so the eco is 10 lumens

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.370 
low medium high so the eco is 10 lumens
the<00:02:02.030> low<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.680> let<00:02:03.680> me<00:02:03.770> look<00:02:04.630> 150<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.810> shouldn't

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the low is let me look 150 I shouldn't

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.130 
the low is let me look 150 I shouldn't
like<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:06.650> then<00:02:07.460> we've<00:02:07.550> got<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.729> high<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:08.140> 408

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
like that then we've got a high of 408

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.550 
like that then we've got a high of 408
over<00:02:09.649> 900<00:02:10.959> okay<00:02:11.959> it's<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.140> same<00:02:12.349> with<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
over 900 okay it's the same with the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.210 
over 900 okay it's the same with the
other<00:02:12.590> LED<00:02:14.409> and<00:02:15.409> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.680> run<00:02:15.830> these<00:02:15.950> in

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
other LED and you can run these in

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.239 
other LED and you can run these in
different<00:02:16.700> combinations<00:02:17.889> so<00:02:18.889> obviously

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.249 
different combinations so obviously

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.130 
different combinations so obviously
forgot<00:02:19.519> them<00:02:19.639> both<00:02:19.819> lon<00:02:20.030> hi<00:02:20.950> that's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
forgot them both lon hi that's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.110 
forgot them both lon hi that's
1800<00:02:22.620> lumens<00:02:23.780> now<00:02:25.190> let's<00:02:26.190> put<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.580> low

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
1800 lumens now let's put that on low

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120 
1800 lumens now let's put that on low
and<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> second<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.170> online<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.890> put<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and the second one online I just put the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
and the second one online I just put the
second<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.730> too<00:02:30.030> high<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.740> main

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
second one on too high now this main

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.430 
second one on too high now this main
button<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.459> turns<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.150> off<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.350> it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.980 
button here turns on and off and it
remembers<00:02:34.680> exactly<00:02:35.670> how<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.390> set<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.780> those

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
remembers exactly how you set up those

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.060 
remembers exactly how you set up those
LEDs<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> let's<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.410> put<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:40.890> low

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
LEDs so let's just put that one on low

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.350 
LEDs so let's just put that one on low
and<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.550> alone<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.090> would<00:02:42.270> go

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and that one alone so they would go

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.860 
and that one alone so they would go
that's<00:02:42.540> 20<00:02:42.900> lumens<00:02:43.760> eco<00:02:44.760> mode<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.450> turns<00:02:45.750> it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that's 20 lumens eco mode that turns it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.350 
that's 20 lumens eco mode that turns it
off<00:02:46.550> turns<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:49.350> very<00:02:49.500> simple<00:02:50.360> UI

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
off turns on so it's very simple UI

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.199 
off turns on so it's very simple UI
there<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:53.010> could<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.340> easier<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.670> use<00:02:53.880> really

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
there it could be easier to use really

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.449 
there it could be easier to use really
and<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.410> press<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.800> hold<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.980> straight

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and hold either of these buttons and it

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.759 
and hold either of these buttons and it
straight<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.380> DS<00:03:01.830> strobe<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:04.110> very<00:03:04.320> simple<00:03:04.650> to

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
straight to DS strobe so very simple to

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.180 
straight to DS strobe so very simple to
use<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:06.380> incredibly<00:03:07.380> good<00:03:07.680> beam<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
use like incredibly good beam is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.810 
use like incredibly good beam is
probably<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> most<00:03:08.989> versatile

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
probably one of the most versatile

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.050 
probably one of the most versatile
flashlights<00:03:11.820> are<00:03:11.940> never<00:03:12.120> used<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:13.400> it's<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
flashlights are never used and it's the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.900 
flashlights are never used and it's the
wide<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.810> wide<00:03:16.080> beam<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.620> wide<00:03:17.310> it's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
wide the wide beam is wide it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
wide the wide beam is wide it's
unbelievable<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:21.239> distance<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
unbelievable and the distance on this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.060 
unbelievable and the distance on this
one<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.680> four<00:03:22.950> hundred

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
one I think it's about four hundred

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.759 
one I think it's about four hundred
twenty-five<00:03:23.670> meters<00:03:23.910> throw<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.440> really<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
twenty-five meters throw so it really is

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.310 
twenty-five meters throw so it really is
you<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.910> first<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.170> use<00:03:28.290> it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
you know first time like you can use it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.110 
you know first time like you can use it
for<00:03:28.980> most<00:03:29.489> tasks<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.470> here's<00:03:31.470> some<00:03:31.590> big<00:03:31.709> shots

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.140 

so<00:03:35.959> as<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.349> see<00:03:36.560> here<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:36.890> is<00:03:37.159> the<00:03:37.190> wide

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
so as you can see here this is the wide

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.589 
so as you can see here this is the wide
reflector<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.260> turbo<00:03:39.860> mode<00:03:40.599> distance

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
reflector on the turbo mode distance

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.809 
reflector on the turbo mode distance
beam<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:42.790> 900<00:03:43.790> lumens<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.799> are<00:03:45.980> with

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
beam on 900 lumens and here we are with

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.619 
beam on 900 lumens and here we are with
them<00:03:47.000> up<00:03:47.120> both<00:03:47.659> on<00:03:47.840> together<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.640> low<00:03:49.849> high

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
them up both on together the low high

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.460 
them up both on together the low high
and<00:03:50.959> turbo<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:52.090> 1800<00:03:53.090> lumens<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.629> as<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.349> can

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
and turbo of 1800 lumens and as you can

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.520 
and turbo of 1800 lumens and as you can
see<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.799> nice<00:03:54.980> clean<00:03:55.760> crisp<00:03:56.180> beam<00:03:56.530> there's

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
see it's a nice clean crisp beam there's

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.750 
see it's a nice clean crisp beam there's
a<00:03:57.650> lot<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:57.860> detail<00:03:58.250> there<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:58.730> see

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
a lot of detail there you can see

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.660 
a lot of detail there you can see
everything<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.629> really<00:03:59.780> lights<00:04:00.110> up<00:04:00.349> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
everything can it really lights up the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.220 
everything can it really lights up the
church<00:04:01.670> tower<00:04:02.030> there<00:04:02.329> as<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:02.959> see<00:04:03.049> from

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
church tower there as you can see from

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.319 
church tower there as you can see from
the<00:04:03.379> beam<00:04:03.530> shots<00:04:03.799> it's<00:04:03.980> really<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> nice<00:04:04.459> first

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
the beam shots it's really a nice first

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.780 
the beam shots it's really a nice first
I'll<00:04:05.569> light<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.160> use<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.489> for<00:04:07.579> pretty

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
I'll light you can use it for pretty

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.780 
I'll light you can use it for pretty
much<00:04:07.819> any<00:04:08.060> task<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:10.010> not<00:04:10.160> too<00:04:10.280> heavy<00:04:10.459> for

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
much any task and it's not too heavy for

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.960 
much any task and it's not too heavy for
its<00:04:10.819> for<00:04:11.299> its<00:04:11.390> size<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.599> mean<00:04:12.340> it's<00:04:13.340> not<00:04:13.459> not

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
its for its size I mean it's not not

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.199 
its for its size I mean it's not not
small<00:04:14.269> like<00:04:14.299> really<00:04:14.840> it's<00:04:15.769> nearly<00:04:16.209> absolutely

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
small like really it's nearly absolutely

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.719 
small like really it's nearly absolutely
perfect<00:04:17.799> but<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.889> problem<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.310> where<00:04:19.459> lights

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
perfect but the problem is where lights

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.600 
perfect but the problem is where lights
nearly<00:04:20.150> perfect<00:04:20.949> those<00:04:21.949> little<00:04:22.190> nibbly

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
nearly perfect those little nibbly

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.800 
nearly perfect those little nibbly
issues<00:04:23.169> become<00:04:24.169> glaringly<00:04:24.410> obvious<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:26.090> this

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
issues become glaringly obvious so this

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.870 
issues become glaringly obvious so this
does<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.260> thermal<00:04:27.919> step<00:04:28.130> down<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.550> protect

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
does have a thermal step down to protect

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.960 
does have a thermal step down to protect
the<00:04:29.000> LEDs<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:30.560> very<00:04:30.680> sensible<00:04:31.130> thing<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.370> put

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
the LEDs it's very sensible thing to put

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.050 
the LEDs it's very sensible thing to put
into<00:04:32.150> your<00:04:32.419> high-powered<00:04:33.289> torches<00:04:33.919> stops<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
into your high-powered torches stops the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.450 
into your high-powered torches stops the
light<00:04:35.240> from<00:04:35.389> cooking<00:04:35.840> itself<00:04:36.139> basically<00:04:36.460> but

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
light from cooking itself basically but

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.790 
light from cooking itself basically but
the<00:04:37.580> thing<00:04:37.639> is<00:04:37.820> Phoenix<00:04:38.780> have<00:04:38.990> been<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> little

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the thing is Phoenix have been a little

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.159 
the thing is Phoenix have been a little
bit<00:04:39.979> too<00:04:40.130> conservative<00:04:40.820> when<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:41.660> steps

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
bit too conservative when this steps

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.870 
bit too conservative when this steps
down<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:44.120> call<00:04:44.330> itself<00:04:44.630> off<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.880> it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
down and to call itself off it it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.659 
down and to call itself off it it
doesn't<00:04:47.180> even<00:04:47.240> feel<00:04:47.570> warm<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.220> get<00:04:49.460> about

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
doesn't even feel warm so you get about

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.830 
doesn't even feel warm so you get about
15<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.570> 20<00:04:50.690> minutes<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:52.000> 1811<00:04:53.000> turbo<00:04:53.660> mode

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
15 to 20 minutes of 1811 turbo mode

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.170 
15 to 20 minutes of 1811 turbo mode
before<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.830> steps<00:04:55.099> down<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.370> protect<00:04:55.610> itself

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
before it steps down to protect itself

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.110 
before it steps down to protect itself
so<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.080> think<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.440> could<00:04:57.620> probably<00:04:57.940> get<00:04:58.940> bit

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
so I think it could probably get bit

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.430 
so I think it could probably get bit
more<00:04:59.240> light<00:04:59.450> out<00:04:59.479> of<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> think<00:05:00.380> you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
more light out of that I think you

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.080 
more light out of that I think you
should<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.770> run<00:05:01.039> for<00:05:01.190> about<00:05:01.250> 45<00:05:01.880> minutes

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
should go to run for about 45 minutes

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.920 
should go to run for about 45 minutes
without<00:05:02.330> even<00:05:02.780> getting<00:05:02.900> hot<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:05.300> these

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
without even getting hot and these

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.810 
without even getting hot and these
buttons<00:05:06.260> are<00:05:06.349> a<00:05:06.410> little<00:05:06.590> bit<00:05:06.860> too<00:05:07.099> easy<00:05:07.490> to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
buttons are a little bit too easy to

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.089 
buttons are a little bit too easy to
accidentally<00:05:08.530> activate<00:05:09.530> they're<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:09.919> little

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
accidentally activate they're a little

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.040 
accidentally activate they're a little
bit<00:05:10.250> soft<00:05:10.550> so<00:05:11.479> if<00:05:11.570> you've<00:05:11.660> got<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:11.840> at

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
bit soft so if you've got this at

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.230 
bit soft so if you've got this at
kicking<00:05:12.349> about<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.710> bag<00:05:12.919> you<00:05:13.849> could<00:05:14.030> quite

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
kicking about the bag you could quite

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.950 
kicking about the bag you could quite
easily<00:05:14.270> turn<00:05:14.720> these<00:05:14.900> burns<00:05:15.139> on<00:05:16.690> but<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.780> can

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
easily turn these burns on but you can

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.990 
easily turn these burns on but you can
lock<00:05:18.139> lock<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.650> out<00:05:18.740> by<00:05:18.979> giving<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.699> back<00:05:19.880> of

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
lock lock it out by giving the back of

lock lock it out by giving the back of
this<00:05:20.060> battery<00:05:20.419> tube<00:05:20.599> a<00:05:20.720> couple<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.050> twists<00:05:21.440> it

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
this battery tube a couple of twists it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.920 
this battery tube a couple of twists it
stops<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.250> working<00:05:22.669> so<00:05:23.389> he's<00:05:23.539> pretty<00:05:23.810> much

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930
