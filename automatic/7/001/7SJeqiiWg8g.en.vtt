00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.629
 byrd anac cultural today its time 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 Pisto ex tend 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.710
 I do not know if this is the way it is pronounced 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.880
 my english is so bad, so it goes 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 to stay anyway is different from the one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 of the ones that already have here in the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 common 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.930
 this one with several can be more 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 of just fucking can put more than 1 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 to extend can put several of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 return here 3 1 and 3 to give an example but 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.250
 You can put more never done here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.430
 could and so will 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.719
 understood then let's go to the tutorial 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.539
 the real time 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 first you will do this then the 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.800
 put the three block pistons and let's 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.230
 do it here 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.690
 the way it is here after having 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.609
 done that put a repeat here 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 one more block here and another competitor 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.590
 on top of that block you just put it there 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.290
 here we are going to put another blog is from 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.439
 tony 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:20.189
 We'll get you to put a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:25.520
 network story here a story here 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.090
 the block on another geek network said here 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.430
 placing the block 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.049
 so now you want to put a network 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.229
 Argentine history here more often 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.060
 here in this repeater to put with the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.829
 law trade 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 Then I came down here to put the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.130
 chip 101 redstone block after we go 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.549
 put a lavender here you go 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 that the tripod lane is already 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.939
 but it does not return to focus 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.920
 because it can make a system of type รง a 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 people do pull all the blocks that is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.709
 what to put a network towel 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.470
 story here two blocks here so 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.600
 This one is going to put 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 repeating with dulce de leche how to turn it off 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.410
 Let's hang up here to stay this 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.530
 clatter 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.050
 Now I've come here, too, let's do the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.670
 prodes system stop this lever from here 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.750
 which is what we'll put a block here 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:41.000
 and we can take that lever 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:48.350
 here we also put another grandmother who 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.830
 that's where the movie comes from, then afterwards 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.209
 torch 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:59.450
 I'm here for two blocks. 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.370
 this story of putting a network story 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.810
 and a gunman let down 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.120
 position here 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.610
 This way it's going to stay that way. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.690
 now we will give name in the final part of 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.360
 our extended piston trio which is two 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.320
 blocks here and another here on this day 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:27.080
 put repeaters in this way and all 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.730
 and all stars repeater 11 4 where 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.500
 have to be with three of them all 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.720
 now you must upload a block that will 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:45.070
 put the potato and put our chip 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:49.660
 101 on a story watering pad on it 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.660
 Now we're going to fight here. 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.950
 now we are going to the final part of our 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.950
 tribute is that it is understood that it is the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.860
 that put three blocks here 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.780
 so forming miele let's put 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:17.769
 four competitors here who will be a 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.700
 here two sides there like this 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.660
 way 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.350
 however all 4 and stay with 43 of law 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.510
 all of them 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:36.370
 after that you should put a block like this 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.570
 trip to black block block is the block of 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.450
 story 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.220
 after that it's only finished vim 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:48.220
 here it's ready 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.490
 Our Wheat Christ is now made to 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.660
 People want to do the part Texas has to 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:01.510
 see what he was going to do 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:03.150
 hearing this side following here too 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.150
 simple 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
 O 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.620
 we now do a repeater here with 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:25.050
 three of law these two is down here 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.050
 here just do the same thing down here 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:40.990
 the touch is here where the brazuca 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:46.090
 standardized models that come behind and 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:50.440
 It's so sad that now that it's going 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.970
 climb all 36 want bigger only six 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.050
 come here to do the same thing as stay 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:58.450
 remembering that when you give the network 15 blocks 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.720
 story will lose its strength because 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.460
 who does not know she'll only have 15 blocks 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.110
 So when does the blocks there? 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.639
 lose strength if you do not have to do 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:15.439
 system to continue the connection but 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:17.569
 It's the less tutorial there , cool 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.279
