00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 No 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.110
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.930
 top five this week the text apex 64 x 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.910
 64 today we are again our top 5 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.520
 before and I wish you now without much 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.119
 schwafel have fun while watching 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.460
 after fifth place this week over 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.680
 it is very much based on the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 full text the contours, however, act 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.820
 sharper overall but strong 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.420
 softened the details hold up 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 within limits 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.810
 but for followers of the classic 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.810
 Textures definitely worth a look 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.879
 O 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.799
 space four is this week do force 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 as the name already suggests 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.359
 the texture pack thematically to doom 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.159
 adapted beautiful detailed textures 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.159
 with some easter eggs interfere 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.899
 the dark room textures have this effect 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.729
 almost black this is a big one 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.380
 negative point in my opinion after all 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.209
 Overall, a very nice texture pack 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.209
 especially suitable for adventure net 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.510
 in third place we find the nation as a nation 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.760
 texture pack is something in time-wise 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.040
 ajar very gloomy but thematic 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.510
 matching who did not want that ever 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.430
 copy your own survival horror 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.229
 Light waves cast little light 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.990
 at night it is almost pitch dark 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.990
 unusual and innovative recommended 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.780
 place two occupied rom ladies upbeat 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.940
 Overall, it looks very bright with fine 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.160
 contours the strengths are very clear 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.810
 especially small textures for wood textures 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.210
 villages with wooden buildings look very 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.520
 handsome from thematically very clear on 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.690
 medieval and fantasy oriented 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.690
 Pump it up high with us 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.459
 place one goes to my power the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.620
 textures of hannibal are well 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.159
 sometimes the best known but also the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.049
 beautiful no contours and details the 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.360
 environment is well lit and keeps 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.010
 a great feature is not there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.930
 only a current texture pack but 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.269
 ten different for every taste 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.010
 So there's something about thematically 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.049
 halloween and christmas over 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.420
 Everybody finds middle ages and asian 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.280

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.970
