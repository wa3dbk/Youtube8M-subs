we're going to show you how to do two
colors<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.430> an<00:00:08.640> art<00:00:08.820> metal<00:00:09.090> embellishment

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
colors on an art metal embellishment

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.170 
colors on an art metal embellishment
using<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> glaze<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.070> create<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> wash<00:00:11.850> over

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
using the glaze to create a wash over

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.209 
using the glaze to create a wash over
another<00:00:12.540> color<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.080> I'm<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.860> work<00:00:14.010> with

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
another color so I'm going to work with

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.090 
another color so I'm going to work with
ochre<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.910> rust<00:00:15.440> you<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.860> I<00:00:16.920> have

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
ochre and rust you can see that I have

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.060 
ochre and rust you can see that I have
applied<00:00:17.850> more<00:00:18.270> ochre<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.780> my<00:00:19.440> nonstick<00:00:19.740> crashy

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
applied more ochre to my nonstick crashy

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.200 
applied more ochre to my nonstick crashy
because<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> use<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
because I'm going to use that as the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.780 
because I'm going to use that as the
base<00:00:21.450> so<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.620> over<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.130> entire<00:00:23.490> piece

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
base so when I go over this entire piece

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.990 
base so when I go over this entire piece
with<00:00:23.970> ochre<00:00:28.100> let's<00:00:29.100> apply<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.610> all<00:00:29.850> these

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
with ochre let's apply it to all these

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
with ochre let's apply it to all these
err<00:00:30.300> detailed<00:00:30.990> areas<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.530> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> see

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
err detailed areas you're going to see

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
err detailed areas you're going to see
some<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> metal<00:00:32.579> showing<00:00:32.759> through<00:00:33.180> from

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
some of the metal showing through from

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.660 
some of the metal showing through from
this<00:00:33.540> part<00:00:33.780> metal<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.920> piece<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> very

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this part metal this piece is very

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.919 
this part metal this piece is very
detailed<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.329> has<00:00:36.480> some<00:00:36.660> raised

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929

applying my second color of glaze I'm
going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.929> use<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.109> heat<00:00:46.499> tool<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> speed<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
going to use a heat tool to speed up the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:01:03.440 
going to use a heat tool to speed up the
drying<00:00:48.390> time

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.640 

okay<00:01:04.450> and<00:01:04.630> you<00:01:04.690> can<00:01:04.780> see<00:01:04.840> they<00:01:05.110> have<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.290> very

okay and you can see they have a very

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.640 
okay and you can see they have a very
small<00:01:06.070> amount<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.670> rust<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.420> want<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.380> create

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
small amount of rust I want to create

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.910 
small amount of rust I want to create
just<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.340> wash<00:01:10.150> of<00:01:10.540> rust<00:01:10.990> on<00:01:11.260> top<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.830> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
just a a wash of rust on top of the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.440 
just a a wash of rust on top of the
agate<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.370> it<00:01:12.460> has<00:01:12.610> more<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.940> transparent

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
agate so it has more of a transparent

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.590 
agate so it has more of a transparent
look<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.410> what<00:01:14.560> I'm<00:01:14.650> going<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.800> do<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.100> use<00:01:15.250> our

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
look so what I'm going to do is use our

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750 
look so what I'm going to do is use our
the<00:01:16.600> glaze<00:01:16.960> as<00:01:17.320> an<00:01:17.500> extender<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.220> I'm<00:01:18.580> about

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
the glaze as an extender so I'm about

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.090 
the glaze as an extender so I'm about
one<00:01:19.090> part<00:01:19.480> patina<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.290> about<00:01:20.470> two<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.070> three

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
one part patina to about two to three

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.510 
one part patina to about two to three
parts<00:01:21.580> glaze<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.920> do<00:01:24.040> not<00:01:24.220> want<00:01:24.430> to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
parts glaze and you do not want to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.880 
parts glaze and you do not want to
dilute<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.000> patinas<00:01:25.360> with<00:01:25.540> water<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.620> if<00:01:26.740> you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
dilute the patinas with water so if you

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.710 
dilute the patinas with water so if you
want<00:01:27.130> more<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.700> washed<00:01:28.150> or<00:01:28.660> a

colors<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.180> definitely<00:01:31.540> want<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.750> mix<00:01:32.020> it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
colors you definitely want to mix it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.590 
colors you definitely want to mix it
