is<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.630> one<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.780> recommend<00:02:27.230> because<00:02:27.350> they're

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
is the one I recommend because they're

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.120 
is the one I recommend because they're
usually<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:28.010> easiest<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.640> find<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
usually the easiest to find but the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.070 
usually the easiest to find but the
reason<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.550> always<00:02:31.820> suggest<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.600> because

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
reason I always suggest this is because

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.470 
reason I always suggest this is because
when<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.890> comes<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.060> craft<00:02:35.330> beer
