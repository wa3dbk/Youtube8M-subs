like<00:00:15.019> 200<00:00:15.440> miles<00:00:15.589> a<00:00:15.709> week<00:00:15.830> was<00:00:16.070> kind<00:00:16.280> of<00:00:16.309> my<00:00:16.460> if

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
like 200 miles a week was kind of my if

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.300 
like 200 miles a week was kind of my if
I<00:00:17.420> could<00:00:17.600> hit<00:00:17.720> that<00:00:17.830> then<00:00:18.830> I<00:00:18.920> was<00:00:19.070> good<00:00:19.280> you

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
I could hit that then I was good you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.000 
I could hit that then I was good you
know<00:00:19.700> and<00:00:20.480> if<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.050> could<00:00:21.320> do<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.560> for<00:00:21.740> four<00:00:21.920> or

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
know and if I could do that for four or

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.320 
know and if I could do that for four or
five<00:00:22.070> weeks<00:00:22.190> in<00:00:22.520> a<00:00:22.580> row<00:00:22.610> I<00:00:22.730> was<00:00:22.940> ready<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.180> race

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
five weeks in a row I was ready to race

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.030 
five weeks in a row I was ready to race
100<00:00:23.660> miles<00:00:23.810> which<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.290> just<00:00:24.470> I<00:00:24.680> think<00:00:24.710> about

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
100 miles which is just I think about

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.010 
100 miles which is just I think about
that<00:00:25.160> now<00:00:25.310> it's<00:00:25.520> silly<00:00:25.790> kind<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.660> biggest

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
that now it's silly kind of the biggest

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.460 
that now it's silly kind of the biggest
shift<00:00:27.200> has<00:00:27.380> been<00:00:28.060> in<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.540> last<00:00:29.720> year<00:00:30.080> year<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
shift has been in the last year year and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.109 
shift has been in the last year year and
a<00:00:30.530> half<00:00:30.680> really<00:00:31.010> I<00:00:31.040> broke<00:00:31.250> my<00:00:31.370> leg<00:00:31.580> last<00:00:31.820> summer

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
a half really I broke my leg last summer

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.919 
a half really I broke my leg last summer
2011<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.200> coming<00:00:33.980> back<00:00:34.100> from<00:00:34.280> that<00:00:34.489> I<00:00:34.929> I'd

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
2011 and coming back from that I I'd

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.079 
2011 and coming back from that I I'd
started<00:00:36.320> doing<00:00:36.499> a<00:00:36.530> lot<00:00:36.589> of<00:00:36.710> hiking<00:00:37.089> just

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
started doing a lot of hiking just

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.729 
started doing a lot of hiking just
because<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:38.359> less<00:00:38.510> impact<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.109> running<00:00:39.350> on

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
because it's less impact and running on

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.310 
because it's less impact and running on
the<00:00:39.800> broken<00:00:40.309> leg<00:00:40.489> that<00:00:40.929> totally<00:00:41.929> shifted<00:00:42.199> my

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
the broken leg that totally shifted my

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.369 
the broken leg that totally shifted my
perspective<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:43.899> running<00:00:44.899> in<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> mountains

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
perspective on running in the mountains

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.410 
perspective on running in the mountains
I<00:00:45.440> guess<00:00:45.679> or<00:00:45.859> just<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.550> know<00:00:46.640> moving<00:00:46.940> fast<00:00:47.239> in

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I guess or just you know moving fast in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.200 
I guess or just you know moving fast in
the<00:00:47.480> mountains<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.609> as<00:00:49.609> a<00:00:49.640> result<00:00:49.999> of<00:00:50.120> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
the mountains and as a result of the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.779 
the mountains and as a result of the
past<00:00:50.420> year<00:00:50.629> I've<00:00:50.749> really<00:00:50.809> gotten<00:00:51.260> into<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.890> lot

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
past year I've really gotten into a lot

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.910 
past year I've really gotten into a lot
more<00:00:52.819> tracking<00:00:53.449> more<00:00:53.839> just<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.199> time<00:00:54.469> on<00:00:54.649> feet

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
more tracking more just a time on feet

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.430 
more tracking more just a time on feet
and<00:00:55.129> vertical<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:55.899> going<00:00:56.899> after<00:00:57.260> really

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
and vertical and going after really

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.160 
and vertical and going after really
steep<00:00:57.679> terrain<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.629> just<00:00:59.629> racking<00:00:59.989> up<00:01:00.079> as

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
steep terrain and just racking up as

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.689 
steep terrain and just racking up as
much<00:01:00.289> vertical<00:01:00.679> feet<00:01:00.829> as<00:01:00.920> possible<00:01:01.460> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
much vertical feet as possible and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.579 
much vertical feet as possible and
tagging<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:02.510> many<00:01:02.690> summits<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.079> possible

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
tagging as many summits as possible

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.020 
tagging as many summits as possible
that's<00:01:04.129> kind<00:01:04.370> of<00:01:04.400> been<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.580> focus<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.909> my

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
that's kind of been the focus of my

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.310 
that's kind of been the focus of my
training<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.630> past<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.960> know<00:01:05.990> it's

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
training for the past you know it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.130 
training for the past you know it's
funny<00:01:06.500> because<00:01:06.710> right<00:01:07.700> now<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.780> know<00:01:08.869> summer

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
funny because right now you know summer

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.569 
funny because right now you know summer
2012<00:01:09.590> I<00:01:09.860> feel<00:01:10.009> like<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:10.219> in<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.340> best<00:01:10.520> shape

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.510 
2012 I feel like I'm in the best shape
of<00:01:10.700> my<00:01:10.759> life<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:12.110> know<00:01:12.170> PR<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.399> all

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
of my life and you know PR and on all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.370 
of my life and you know PR and on all
kinds<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:13.850> hill<00:01:13.969> climbs<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.509> stuff<00:01:14.659> by<00:01:14.899> big

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
kinds of hill climbs and stuff by big

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.800 
kinds of hill climbs and stuff by big
chunks<00:01:15.829> and<00:01:15.950> really<00:01:16.939> excited<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.329> race<00:01:17.479> again

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
chunks and really excited to race again

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.469 
chunks and really excited to race again
it's<00:01:18.320> definitely<00:01:18.950> become<00:01:19.579> much<00:01:19.789> less<00:01:20.060> about

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
it's definitely become much less about

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.510 
it's definitely become much less about
oh<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.259> need<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.560> be<00:01:21.710> able<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.860> run<00:01:22.009> every<00:01:22.219> step

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
oh I need to be able to run every step

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.190 
oh I need to be able to run every step
of<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.880> climb<00:01:23.149> or<00:01:23.420> something<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.930> just<00:01:23.960> like

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
of a climb or something and just like

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.480 
of a climb or something and just like
well<00:01:24.560> I'm<00:01:24.590> going<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.130> top<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
well I'm going to get to the top the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.889 
well I'm going to get to the top the
fastest<00:01:25.850> way<00:01:25.939> possible<00:01:25.969> and<00:01:26.509> if<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.750> means

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
fastest way possible and if that means

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.870 
fastest way possible and if that means
taking<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.320> more<00:01:27.469> direct<00:01:27.710> line<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.369> hiking

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
taking a more direct line and and hiking

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.510 
taking a more direct line and and hiking
up<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:30.140> know<00:01:30.229> 45-degree<00:01:30.920> slope<00:01:31.219> or

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
up you know 45-degree slope or

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.580 
up you know 45-degree slope or
scrambling<00:01:32.030> like<00:01:32.060> some<00:01:32.359> fourth<00:01:32.539> class<00:01:32.750> Ridge

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
scrambling like some fourth class Ridge

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.170 
scrambling like some fourth class Ridge
or<00:01:33.799> something<00:01:34.159> then<00:01:34.369> that's<00:01:34.579> what<00:01:34.969> I'm<00:01:35.030> going

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
or something then that's what I'm going

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.139 
or something then that's what I'm going
to<00:01:35.210> do<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:36.909> become<00:01:37.909> more

the mountain for me trail running a big
part<00:02:01.609> of<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.789> is<00:02:01.850> just<00:02:02.469> integrating<00:02:03.469> myself<00:02:03.590> in

part of it is just integrating myself in

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.580 
part of it is just integrating myself in
a<00:02:03.950> natural<00:02:04.249> environment<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.439> feeling<00:02:06.439> that

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
a natural environment and feeling that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.249 
a natural environment and feeling that
connection<00:02:06.829> with<00:02:07.130> with<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.520> place<00:02:07.759> and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and just sort of like the overall sense

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.150 
and just sort of like the overall sense
of<00:02:11.810> well-being<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.379> peace<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.890> brings

which<00:02:13.849> starts<00:02:14.690> sounding<00:02:14.840> pretty<00:02:15.170> like<00:02:15.500> new

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
which starts sounding pretty like new

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.220 
which starts sounding pretty like new
aging<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.970> spiritual<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.019> mean<00:02:18.140> that's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
aging and spiritual but I mean that's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.290 
aging and spiritual but I mean that's
that's<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.800> way<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.099> for<00:02:19.250> me<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.550> that's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that's the way it is for me and that's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.350 
that's the way it is for me and that's
by<00:02:20.690> far<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.379> overriding<00:02:22.030> motivating<00:02:23.030> factor

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
by far the overriding motivating factor

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.570 
by far the overriding motivating factor
for<00:02:23.390> me<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> mean<00:02:24.110> racing<00:02:24.920> there's

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
for me in it I mean racing there's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.949 
for me in it I mean racing there's
definitely<00:02:26.030> motivation<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.630> because<00:02:26.870> I

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
definitely motivation there because I

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.750 
definitely motivation there because I
have<00:02:27.050> an<00:02:27.140> ego<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:28.010> that's<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.610> main
