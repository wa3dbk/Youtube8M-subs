go right before it and you want to type

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.800 
go right before it and you want to type
0<00:03:47.390> 3<00:03:48.170> for<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.610> could<00:03:49.730> also<00:03:49.910> go<00:03:50.450> higher

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
0 3 for the you could also go higher

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.880 
0 3 for the you could also go higher
than<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.620> could<00:03:51.739> type<00:03:52.010> in<00:03:52.900> 06<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.200> 05<00:03:54.530> or

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
than that you could type in 06 or 05 or

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.860 
than that you could type in 06 or 05 or
actually<00:03:55.820> up<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.090> 99<00:03:56.570> but<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:58.190> try<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.480> tried

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
actually up to 99 but I try to I tried

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.780 
actually up to 99 but I try to I tried
doing<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.230> once<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.709> crashed<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.760> I

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
doing that once and it crashed so I

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.789 
doing that once and it crashed so I
wouldn't<00:04:02.330> recommend<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:03.049> but<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.350> think<00:04:03.680> it

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
wouldn't recommend it but I think it

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.280 
wouldn't recommend it but I think it
might<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:03.980> possible<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.450> now<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:06.200> to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
might be possible and now you want to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.070 
might be possible and now you want to
edit<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.650> ID<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.420> want<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.720> find<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
edit the ID then you want to find the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.440 
edit the ID then you want to find the
first<00:04:09.410> dot<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:10.070> didn't<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:10.820> should<00:04:11.150> have<00:04:11.239> typed

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
first dot I didn't I should have typed

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.240 
first dot I didn't I should have typed
that<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.290> after<00:04:12.799> where<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.700> says<00:04:13.940> ID<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:15.250> hear

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
that and after where it says ID and hear

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.640 
that and after where it says ID and hear
all<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.790> different<00:04:17.120> ones<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.419> can<00:04:17.570> use<00:04:17.780> night
