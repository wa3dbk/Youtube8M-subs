00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
I mean they probably can't use it in the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.610 
I mean they probably can't use it in the
wintertime<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.370> more<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.720> spring<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.350> like

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620
