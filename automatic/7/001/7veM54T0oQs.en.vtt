00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
first and second deck once we've done

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.560 
first and second deck once we've done
that<00:00:54.620> we're<00:00:54.979> going<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.250> click<00:00:55.489> MIDI<00:00:55.850> here<00:00:56.420> at

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
that we're going to click MIDI here at

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.119 
that we're going to click MIDI here at
the<00:00:56.750> top<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.320> can<00:00:57.350> see<00:00:57.619> that<00:00:57.799> all<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
the top and you can see that all of the

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.009 
the top and you can see that all of the
different<00:00:58.400> parameters<00:00:58.750> have<00:00:59.750> now<00:00:59.960> turned

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
different parameters have now turned

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.100 
different parameters have now turned
blue<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:01.369> means<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.909> they<00:01:02.119> are<00:01:02.150> MIDI<00:01:02.570> map

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
blue that means that they are MIDI map

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.190 
blue that means that they are MIDI map
Abul<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:03.619> when<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.460> assign<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:05.150> MIDI<00:01:05.360> control

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
Abul and when you assign a MIDI control

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.649 
Abul and when you assign a MIDI control
to<00:01:06.380> them<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.830> little<00:01:07.790> number<00:01:07.970> will<00:01:08.150> pop<00:01:08.330> up<00:01:08.360> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
to them a little number will pop up and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.410 
to them a little number will pop up and
that's<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.990> MIDI<00:01:09.259> note<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.579> is<00:01:10.850> controlling

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
that's the MIDI note that is controlling

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.990 
that's the MIDI note that is controlling
that<00:01:11.450> parameter<00:01:12.369> so<00:01:13.369> we're<00:01:13.520> going<00:01:13.609> to<00:01:13.670> start

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
that parameter so we're going to start

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.990 
that parameter so we're going to start
with<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.140> volume<00:01:15.829> faders<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.670> we<00:01:16.759> can<00:01:16.880> just

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
with the volume faders and we can just

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.209 
with the volume faders and we can just
simply<00:01:17.299> click<00:01:17.359> on<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.869> move<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.859> fader<00:01:19.100> on

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
simply click on it and move the fader on

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.419 
simply click on it and move the fader on
the<00:01:19.430> accession<00:01:19.909> Pro<00:01:20.329> to<00:01:21.140> assign<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.859> control

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
the accession Pro to assign that control

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.480 
the accession Pro to assign that control
and<00:01:22.640> I'll<00:01:22.729> do<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:22.969> for<00:01:23.179> Dec<00:01:23.359> 2<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:25.250> next

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and I'll do that for Dec 2 and next

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.730 
and I'll do that for Dec 2 and next
we're<00:01:25.729> going<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.000> do<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.539> EQ<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.439> we'll<00:01:27.560> start

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
we're going to do the EQ so we'll start

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.160 
we're going to do the EQ so we'll start
with<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.979> low<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:28.429> you<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:29.119> see<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.659> we<00:01:29.899> have

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
with a low and you can see that we have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.609 
with a low and you can see that we have
already<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:32.719> knobs<00:01:32.990> for<00:01:33.829> EQ<00:01:34.429> here<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.619> here

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
already the knobs for EQ here and here

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.279 
already the knobs for EQ here and here
on<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.979> X<00:01:37.130> session<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:38.719> we'll<00:01:38.840> use<00:01:39.079> those

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
on the X session so we'll use those

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:46.270 
on the X session so we'll use those
controls<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.990> we'll<00:01:45.229> do<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.770> deck<00:01:45.979> 1

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
controls and we'll do that for deck 1

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.490 
controls and we'll do that for deck 1
well

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780 

great<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.220> next<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.610> we're

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
great now the next thing that we're

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.660 
great now the next thing that we're
going<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:56.970> want<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:58.710> set<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.370> our

well<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.610> deck

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
well on deck

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.780 
well on deck
1<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.800> deck<00:02:16.980> 2<00:02:17.130> sorry<00:02:18.800> alright<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> next

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
1 or deck 2 sorry alright and the next

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
1 or deck 2 sorry alright and the next
thing<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.150> we're<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> do<00:02:22.170> is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
thing that we're going to want to do is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.280 
thing that we're going to want to do is
go<00:02:22.800> into<00:02:23.070> our<00:02:23.480> maximum<00:02:24.480> values<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.170> can

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
go into our maximum values here you can

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.810 
go into our maximum values here you can
see<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.070> minimum<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.580> maximum

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
see that we have minimum and maximum

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.170 
see that we have minimum and maximum
values<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.690> want<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.080> limit<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.180> say

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
values so if you want to limit the say

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.930 
values so if you want to limit the say
range<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.660> frequencies<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.280> volume<00:02:32.640> level

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
range of frequencies or the volume level

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 
range of frequencies or the volume level
you<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.110> see<00:02:34.290> we

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you can do that and so you can see we

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.370 
you can do that and so you can see we
have<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.340> lot<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.550> these<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.970> say<00:02:36.120> 6<00:02:36.570> dB<00:02:36.990> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
have a lot of these that say 6 dB and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.260 
have a lot of these that say 6 dB and
what<00:02:37.590> we're<00:02:37.709> gonna<00:02:37.800> want<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> do<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:39.000> just

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
what we're gonna want to do is just

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.440 
what we're gonna want to do is just
change<00:02:39.510> them<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.980> 0<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.209> we're

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
change them all to 0 that way we're

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.010 
change them all to 0 that way we're
never<00:02:42.600> actually<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.500> above<00:02:43.920> zero<00:02:44.190> decibels

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
never actually going above zero decibels

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.540 
never actually going above zero decibels
on<00:02:46.020> our<00:02:46.590> eq's<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:48.020> our<00:02:49.020> track<00:02:49.920> volumes<00:02:51.530> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
on our eq's or our track volumes and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.870 
on our eq's or our track volumes and
depending<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.880> controls<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.630> map

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
depending on what controls you map

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.160 
depending on what controls you map
you'll<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.120> either<00:02:57.360> volume<00:02:57.810> controls

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you'll have either volume controls

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.620 
you'll have either volume controls
frequency<00:02:58.680> controls<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.100> kind<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.370> thing

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
frequency controls that kind of thing

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.900 
frequency controls that kind of thing
for<00:03:00.630> your<00:03:00.780> minimum<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.290> maximum<00:03:01.910> values

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
for your minimum and maximum values

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
for your minimum and maximum values
alright<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.840> now<00:03:03.959> i'm<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:04.110> going<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.440> show

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
alright so now i'm just going to show

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.930 
alright so now i'm just going to show
you<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:04.950> we've<00:03:05.100> done<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:07.160> let's<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.670> out<00:03:08.790> of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you what we've done and let's get out of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.350 
you what we've done and let's get out of
the<00:03:09.090> mini<00:03:09.269> map<00:03:09.420> mode<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.930> let's<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.410> start

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
the mini map mode and let's just start

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:21.630 
the mini map mode and let's just start
to<00:03:12.360> tracks

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.720 

all<00:03:22.510> right<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.510> see<00:03:25.690> here<00:03:26.110> on<00:03:26.730> deck

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
all right so you can see here on deck

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.570 
all right so you can see here on deck
one<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.300> take<00:03:28.450> up<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.960> lows<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.950> mids<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
one I can take up the lows the mids the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.710 
one I can take up the lows the mids the
highs<00:03:31.110> bring<00:03:32.110> them<00:03:32.260> all<00:03:32.380> back<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.630> you

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
highs bring them all back in and you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.290 
highs bring them all back in and you
also<00:03:34.840> notice<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.260> they<00:03:35.500> never<00:03:35.740> go<00:03:35.980> above<00:03:36.190> 0db

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
also notice that they never go above 0db

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.330 
also notice that they never go above 0db
because<00:03:37.780> we've<00:03:37.990> set<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.410> maximum<00:03:38.740> parameter

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
because we've set the maximum parameter

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.700 
because we've set the maximum parameter
to<00:03:39.490> zero<00:03:39.840> now<00:03:40.840> let's<00:03:40.990> say<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.320> want<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.590> get<00:03:42.580> a

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
to zero now let's say we want to get a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:51.900 
to zero now let's say we want to get a
beer<00:03:44.710> peed<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:50.070> maybe<00:03:51.070> do<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> little<00:03:51.610> filter

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
beer peed on maybe do a little filter

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.600 
beer peed on maybe do a little filter
delay<00:03:58.020> all<00:03:59.020> right<00:03:59.260> now<00:03:59.440> let's<00:03:59.590> yeah<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.459> can

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
delay all right now let's yeah we can

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.400 
delay all right now let's yeah we can
see<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.970> effects<00:04:01.330> on<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.630> other<00:04:01.930> deck<00:04:02.230> here

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
see the effects on the other deck here

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.580 
see the effects on the other deck here
maybe<00:04:05.410> swap<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.950> base<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.110> affect

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
maybe swap the base and have that affect

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:25.130 
maybe swap the base and have that affect
on

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:34.130 

bring<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.290> down<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.990> yeah<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:32.500> that's<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
bring that down and yeah so that's the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.520 
bring that down and yeah so that's the
basic<00:04:35.140> MIDI<00:04:35.980> mappings<00:04:36.580> for<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.600> m-audio

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
basic MIDI mappings for the m-audio

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.520
