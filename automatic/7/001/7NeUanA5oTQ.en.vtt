 the trees 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.859
 for the correct and efficient production of latex requires four phases

 determinant for success in ensuring the productive life of trees 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.639
 the linking of the Colombian peasant population has been necessary 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.460
 as a basis for productivity

 guarantee the preparation of the people this we want here is a

 However 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.180
 Once the rubber is obtained it can be marketed in three ways

 where is the business 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.209
 rubber keeps a very interesting margin that could be close to 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:00.800
 50% pressure on cost for 30 years 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819

 they do not stop there 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.520
 since its production incorporates parallel businesses such as the sale of 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.889
 wood at the end of the crop 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.499

 as well as by a cee plant that is due through future compartments

 our studies
