that drawing effect so the question then

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.250 
that drawing effect so the question then
is<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:21.520> don't<00:02:21.730> want<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.600> too<00:02:22.780> watery

give you the measurement of what after
stop<00:02:32.950> right<00:02:33.340> I've<00:02:33.880> washed<00:02:34.269> my<00:02:34.600> video<00:02:35.320> okay<00:02:35.830> I'm

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
stop right I've washed my video okay I'm

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.100 
stop right I've washed my video okay I'm
just<00:02:36.070> going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.340> measure<00:02:36.760> diagram<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.959> can

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
just going to measure diagram so you can

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.580 
just going to measure diagram so you can
actually<00:02:38.470> understand<00:02:39.070> what<00:02:40.200> I'm<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.410> on

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually understand what I'm going on

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.070 
actually understand what I'm going on
much<00:02:41.830> water<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.489> actually<00:02:42.910> need<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.930> your

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
much water you actually need for your

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080 
much water you actually need for your
own<00:02:44.200> video<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.100> my<00:02:45.370> goodness<00:02:45.670> like

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
own video if you like my goodness like

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.350 
own video if you like my goodness like
going<00:02:46.330> by<00:02:47.070> measuring<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.519> trying<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.970> get<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
going by measuring and trying to get the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.680 
going by measuring and trying to get the
perfection<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.790> exactly<00:02:51.790> what<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.120> needed<00:02:52.150> I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
perfection of exactly what is needed I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.690 
perfection of exactly what is needed I
mean<00:02:52.720> our<00:02:53.110> our<00:02:53.320> mothers<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.769> fathers<00:02:53.950> at<00:02:54.489> home

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
mean our our mothers and fathers at home

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.479 
mean our our mothers and fathers at home
they<00:02:55.360> just<00:02:55.660> gauge<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.709> their<00:02:56.860> eyes<00:02:57.100> and

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
they just gauge it with their eyes and

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.729 
they just gauge it with their eyes and
they<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.570> what<00:02:58.930> exactly<00:02:59.350> is<00:03:00.160> needed<00:03:00.610> so

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
they know what exactly is needed so

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.680 
they know what exactly is needed so
after<00:03:02.739> talking<00:03:03.459> with<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.510> your

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
after talking with you and your

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690 
after talking with you and your
reasoning<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.830> quite<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.489> want

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
reasoning so this is quite when I want

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.220 
reasoning so this is quite when I want
to<00:03:06.730> divide<00:03:07.180> by<00:03:07.420> wet<00:03:07.690> but<00:03:07.930> I've<00:03:08.050> actually

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
to divide by wet but I've actually

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.520 
to divide by wet but I've actually
during<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:10.200> make<00:03:12.030> 500<00:03:13.030> 550<00:03:13.690> grams<00:03:14.170> so

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
during that so to make 500 550 grams so

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.390 
during that so to make 500 550 grams so
for<00:03:14.709> 550<00:03:15.550> grams<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.150> we<00:03:16.360> do<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.959> will<00:03:17.140> need

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
for 550 grams of a we do you will need

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.060 
for 550 grams of a we do you will need
four<00:03:18.400> cups<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.850> water<00:03:19.170> which<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.380> own<00:03:20.769> towels

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
four cups of water which is own towels

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.500 
four cups of water which is own towels
on<00:03:21.310> mal<00:03:21.850> of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
on mal of

I'm<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.349> play<00:03:23.560> my<00:03:23.590> water<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.730 

instead<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.450> using<00:03:28.720> calm<00:03:29.110> someone<00:03:29.500> said<00:03:29.680> you

instead of using calm someone said you

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.600 
instead of using calm someone said you
can<00:03:29.890> use<00:03:29.920> baking<00:03:30.310> powder

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
can use baking powder

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.860 
can use baking powder
I<00:03:30.670> don't<00:03:30.850> know<00:03:30.910> choose<00:03:31.210> that<00:03:31.450> I've<00:03:31.570> not<00:03:31.750> tried

it before well yes but I'm going to be
using<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.330> natural<00:03:34.480> account<00:03:35.020> which<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.410> that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
using the natural account which is that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.650 
using the natural account which is that
the<00:03:35.800> potassium<00:03:36.130> I'm<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.240> going<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.420> pour

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
the potassium I'm just going to pour

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.720 
the potassium I'm just going to pour
that<00:03:37.690> into<00:03:37.930> water<00:03:38.260> we're<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.460> do<00:03:39.580> we're
