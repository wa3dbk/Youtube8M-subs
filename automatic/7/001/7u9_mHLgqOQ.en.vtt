peanuts here in Nova Scotia they think
there<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.439> being<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> real<00:00:20.189> southern<00:00:20.369> crop

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
there was being a real southern crop

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.300 
there was being a real southern crop
that<00:00:20.880> needs<00:00:21.060> tons<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.630> tons<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.840> heat<00:00:22.250> but<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that needs tons and tons of heat but we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.060 
that needs tons and tons of heat but we
have<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> stream<00:00:23.699> growing<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.180> that's<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
have a stream growing here that's a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.710 
have a stream growing here that's a
pretty<00:00:26.070> short<00:00:26.250> season<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.599> grows

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
pretty short season one and it grows

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
pretty short season one and it grows
really<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.439> northern<00:00:28.769> climate<00:00:31.790> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
really well in our northern climate so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.700 
really well in our northern climate so
they're<00:00:32.940> pretty<00:00:33.120> thick<00:00:33.270> crop<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> grow<00:00:33.719> they

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
they're pretty thick crop to grow they

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.080 
they're pretty thick crop to grow they
grow<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.660> bush<00:00:36.809> beans<00:00:37.079> or

special<00:00:44.219> tricks<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> grow<00:00:44.579> them<00:00:47.120> what<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.180> did

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
special tricks to grow them what we did

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
special tricks to grow them what we did
is<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.390> planted<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> seeds<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> garden<00:00:49.500> in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is we planted the seeds in the garden in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
is we planted the seeds in the garden in
early<00:00:50.789> June

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
early June

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.470 
early June
around<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> same<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.289> beans<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.480> then

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
around the same time as beans and then

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380 
around the same time as beans and then
we<00:00:55.250> kept<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.399> weeded<00:00:56.670> intended<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.210> through

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
we kept some weeded intended all through

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
we kept some weeded intended all through
the<00:00:57.449> summer<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.940> after<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> first

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the summer and then after now the first

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
the summer and then after now the first
frost<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.859> dried<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
frost has come it's dried up all the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
frost has come it's dried up all the
leaves<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.719> peanuts<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.080> stopped

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
leaves and the peanuts have stopped

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.100 
leaves and the peanuts have stopped
growing<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.820> time<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> pull<00:01:06.900> them<00:01:07.020> up

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
growing so now it's time to pull them up

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
growing so now it's time to pull them up
and<00:01:07.290> bring<00:01:07.409> them<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> barn<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> can

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and bring them into the barn you can

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.179 
and bring them into the barn you can
check<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> pods<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.010> way<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> grow<00:01:11.540> is

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
check out the pods the way they grow is

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
check out the pods the way they grow is
the<00:01:14.189> peanut<00:01:14.430> plant<00:01:14.580> produces<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> flower<00:01:15.500> near

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the peanut plant produces a flower near

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
the peanut plant produces a flower near
the<00:01:16.619> base<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> plant<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> from<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the base of the plant and from that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
the base of the plant and from that
yellow<00:01:18.659> flower<00:01:18.900> after<00:01:19.500> its<00:01:19.830> pollinated<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
yellow flower after its pollinated it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
yellow flower after its pollinated it
produces<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> pod<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.320> peg<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.460> peg

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
produces a pod or a peg and the peg

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
produces a pod or a peg and the peg
grows<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> soil<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.689> burrows<00:01:25.229> its<00:01:25.380> way

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
grows into the soil just burrows its way

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.149 
grows into the soil just burrows its way
in<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> produces<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.979> peanut<00:01:28.979> pod

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
in and then it produces the peanut pod

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.330 
in and then it produces the peanut pod
at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> end<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> peg<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
at the end of the peg so it's not like a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620 
at the end of the peg so it's not like a
root<00:01:32.490> crop<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> potato<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.509> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
root crop like a potato but it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.520 
root crop like a potato but it's
actually<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.689> seed<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.409> like

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
actually it's actually a seed just like

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.929 
actually it's actually a seed just like
a<00:01:37.560> bean<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> pea<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.280> any<00:01:38.759> other<00:01:39.000> legumes<00:01:40.939> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
a bean or a pea or any other legumes so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
a bean or a pea or any other legumes so
it's<00:01:42.090> pretty<00:01:42.299> cool<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.310> being<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's pretty cool that way and being a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's pretty cool that way and being a
leg<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.700> picks<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.939> nitrogen<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
leg you my picks of nitrogen so it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.080 
leg you my picks of nitrogen so it
improves<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> soil<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.729> future<00:01:47.970> crops

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.389 

so<00:01:53.090> after<00:01:53.329> after<00:01:53.659> we<00:01:53.869> fold<00:01:54.079> them<00:01:54.310> what<00:01:55.310> we're

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
so after after we fold them what we're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.420 
so after after we fold them what we're
going<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.579> do<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.909> we'll<00:01:56.890> make<00:01:57.890> punches<00:01:58.250> from

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
going to do is we'll make punches from

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
going to do is we'll make punches from
them<00:01:59.320> so<00:02:00.320> make<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> bunch<00:02:00.740> like<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.450> then

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
them so make a bunch like this and then

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.539 
them so make a bunch like this and then
we'll<00:02:02.659> we'll<00:02:03.409> just<00:02:03.469> hang<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:03.920> from<00:02:04.310> some

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
we'll we'll just hang them from some

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.259 
we'll we'll just hang them from some
twine<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.960> barn<00:02:06.369> or<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.700> shed<00:02:07.880> or<00:02:08.060> any

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269
