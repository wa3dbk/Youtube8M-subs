character in super mario 3d world and
the<00:01:49.800> stamp<00:01:50.040> collection<00:01:50.520> might<00:01:50.700> hold<00:01:50.940> the

the stamp collection might hold the

the stamp collection might hold the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
evidence so previously the comet

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.410 
evidence so previously the comet
observatory<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.520> been<00:01:53.760> spotted<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.210> some

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
observatory has been spotted in some

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
observatory has been spotted in some
artwork<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.200> game<00:01:55.350> hence<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
artwork for the game hence you have the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
artwork for the game hence you have the
possibility<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.520> rosalina<00:01:57.090> Nick<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.450> return

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
possibility of rosalina Nick and return

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.750 
possibility of rosalina Nick and return
but<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:58.680> evidence<00:01:58.830> has<00:01:59.280> popped<00:01:59.580> up

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
but some more evidence has popped up

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.220 
but some more evidence has popped up
signifying<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.480> she<00:02:00.660> might<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.840> having<00:02:01.080> a

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
signifying that she might be having a

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.140 
signifying that she might be having a
bigger<00:02:01.470> role<00:02:01.680> than<00:02:01.740> what's<00:02:02.160> expected<00:02:02.370> so<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
bigger role than what's expected so in

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.400 
bigger role than what's expected so in
this<00:02:03.240> day<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> collection<00:02:03.870> there<00:02:03.990> seems<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.320> be

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
this day of collection there seems to be

this day of collection there seems to be
