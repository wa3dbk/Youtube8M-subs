 Welcome to one more video from my channel 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.020

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.210
 bringing a more joyous story to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.350
 You're already going to the place in this 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.120
 easter egg years I know well if it's a debut 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 but it's a very interesting game thing 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.370
 is another interaction between the games of 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.980
 nintendo aquino mario kart i consider 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.900
 5 one as a guinea debut I hope that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.989
 You too because I quite liked you. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.820
 from what I saw I was very surprised at the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.340
 The time I saw him and I took time to 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.020
 reason to realize when you 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.960
 See, I think you're going to have the same 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.330
 impression the same feeling I had and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.550
 I'm now documentary coming out of what 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.070
 You're seeing now I'm going to freeze. 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.720
 The image you are seeing is basically 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.940
 a frozen picture of what it is and I found it 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.110
 What a debut is that I think 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.810
 it's a debut 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.869
 there you see the left side of the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.049
 part of mario kart 8 with the block and the 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.220
 plant is the bean plant rising as 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.950
 track right 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 and on the right side you are seeing a 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 classic phase of super mario bros where 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.210
 had a block that we discovered a 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.460
 bean feet and up to the clouds 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.950
 for some bonuses 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.009
