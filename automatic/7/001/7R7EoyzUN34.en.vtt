00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.020
 wana staff for giving me this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.700
 great opportunity and also for the 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.250
 work they do for us 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.439
 having said that he immediately told you about the bug on 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.720
 bug consists of walking under the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 I feel the ocean waters without it 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.270
 to die 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 this video is the first v in the world that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 shows the bug in question 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 all others are registered without 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.260
 using keane capture and or not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 they explain nothing about it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 well now let's see where it is and how 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.520
 the bug works in a channel 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.890
 of the port south of los santos where then 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 I will indicate the point on the map 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.150
 first you will have to stay on one 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.700
 any car go into the water 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.920
 up to touch the bottom of the car exits 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.140
 only when you lack very little air and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
 when you go up to the surface 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 your character will fall to the ground as if 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.909
 the friction of the water had disappeared not 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.159
 may be the needle if it were after a 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.710
 you would be drowned even if 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.420
 change the game sessions and one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.759
 once you get out of the water you won't have to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.469
 redo the whole procedure a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.240
 feet you can reach the border 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.429
 of the Pacific Ocean and even 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
 leave the map for about ten 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.109
 of meters exceeded the latter the game 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 screw will automatically carry it on 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:36.499
 new random now I let you see the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.499
