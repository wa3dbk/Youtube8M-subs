00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.840
 I met the line of lg monitors that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.399
 I figured the ips technology would also 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.399
 was present here in the human eye 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.340
 this control there it comes along with oil 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.990
 in one comes yes and it is with him that you go 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.210
 access and tune digital channels 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.520
 the open tv to join some 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.710
 settings and select the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.690
 audio and video you want 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.420
 The first thing is to connect the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430
 antenna on this album entry year and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.770
 now victor is a pretty cool differential 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.510
 Can you see that the computer is off? 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.280
 if you just want tv 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.160
 just push a power button here in the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.220
 control and the direct angle in the tv function 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 But Claudia can do this without calling 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.700
 the same pc 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.739
 of course and to tune the 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 channels is very simple you can also 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.130
 select the automatic setting that 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.820
 the computer searches for digital channels 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.430
 available what we show and if I 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.430
 I want to watch tv while I use 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.470
 computers can also because of this 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.190
 year has the function of time in petroleum 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170
 pe 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.320
 you activate function to be in all in one 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.720
 pressing the tv pc button then to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.000
 activate TV mode without stopping browsing 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.970
 just hit the pipe button and you're done 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.590
 pctv on the same screen there could be a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.900
 clip should be real right 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.870
 things would be easier that 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.340
 resource is genius is the album came to 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.250
 munch on the market 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.290
 now to close the last function packet 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.989
 monitor all in one has an input 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.209
 and an hdmi output behind it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.090
 that means I can connect 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.940
 other devices like videogame or tv 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.430
 and also place the alan is another 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.430
 monitor or a TV with a larger screen 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.980
 that's right it 's smart and besides being able 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.500
