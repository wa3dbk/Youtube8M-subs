00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi guys you hear it was evil 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.010
 borscht and on the air the lungs give the same 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 fresh news from the world of tanks and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.920
 today which variable tank can in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.460
 near the abyss from the store 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 fresh fears and doubts 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 relatively new little mouse as well 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:28.080
 how are going to remake 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 super pershing begin attentive people 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.090
 Had time to notice that on the general test patch 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.130
 9 and 7 from the tree of development disappeared such 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.579
 tank like a panther m10 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.260
 preferential German st7 what honestly 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.780
 a little strange because he was not much 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.969
 outstanding or too popular and from 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 moreover, it is frankly even more strange 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 until of course it is not known whether they will remove it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 from the game because it was not in the end 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 still announced but the fact remains 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.730
 in 9 7 it was not further developers like 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.190
 known very lately 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.590
 try to rid the rand of imbalances 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 cards in some cases and tinkering about 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 deleting other issues 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 recently it became known that such a card 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.320
 rivers pearl river added list 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 applicants for pour out besides that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.830
 it is also known that people are waiting 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.799
 the return of such a card as a ridge 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.479
 the dragon is waiting for disappointment this is a card in 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.159
 the game wo n't come back at all 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.540
 there is a feeling that soon on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.610
 most cards we can play 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 only in training rooms if so 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 will go on but continue for no one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's no secret that by the way out already 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 quite a long time preparing a new 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 A mouse that will fall into place in vk 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 4502 n i.e. slipper is also wrong 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 It has long been known that in addition to him 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.979
 classic mausgan and will be put 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 a gun like the one on e100 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.579
 Well, that's just a couple of days ago 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.189
 some details were revealed 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.909
 regarding this 150 millimeter 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.649
 guns 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 and it is that on this 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.149
 strange as it may be planned 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.670
 such a thing as gold shells 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.320
 which means that the players who decide 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 I will probably have to pump this car 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 shoot either armor piercing or land mines 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.710
 and here it is really strange 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.869
 I hope that when your drinks 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.690
 roll out the pediment at least something yes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.970
 will change 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.310
 Especially since the replacement is waiting for us in 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.520
 one of the next patches is not next 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.320
 of course but pretty soon the last one 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930
 Today news concerns premium 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.520
 medium tank of the eighth level 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.130
 superpershing as everyone knows 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080
 its leaders are going to translate and how 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.330
 known with the transition the leaders are very many 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.940
 tanks change significantly so what 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.980
 will be with this particular premium st8 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.350
 Well, the developers gave a detailed 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 clarification so it turned out that there will be 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.880
 modified the angle of inclination of the frontal armor and 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.700
 screens as well as the thickness of the additional 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 plates of armor on the tower and the plate as a whole but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.240
 truth unfortunately there does not really give 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.490
 understand how to change 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.310
 games this car well, I think that soon 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.630
