character's level has progressed it was
saving<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.700> world<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.239> it's<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> load

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
saving the world and it's going to load

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.690 
saving the world and it's going to load
it<00:02:33.260> with<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.920> capsule<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.459> just

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
it with that capsule that you just

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.370 
it with that capsule that you just
grabbed<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.510> didn't<00:02:35.750> save<00:02:35.900> over<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
grabbed but you didn't save over that

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.449 
grabbed but you didn't save over that
time<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.800> did<00:02:37.040> touch<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.030> capsule<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.890> when

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
time you did touch the capsule so when

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.720 
time you did touch the capsule so when
you<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.700> again<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.480> will<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.840> right<00:02:42.410> there<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
you go again it will be right there and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:54.589 
you go again it will be right there and
then<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.600> can<00:02:44.780> load<00:02:45.140> again<00:02:49.000> toybox<00:02:51.220> teleport

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.470 

and<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.530> wait<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:56.999> fastest

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and just wait and this is the fastest

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.599 
and just wait and this is the fastest
way<00:02:57.629> since<00:02:58.019> you're<00:02:58.170> using<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.469> teleporter<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
way since you're using a teleporter you

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.369 
way since you're using a teleporter you
could<00:02:59.819> use<00:02:59.969> a<00:02:59.999> vehicle<00:03:00.239> like<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.629> helicopter<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
could use a vehicle like a helicopter to

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.190 
could use a vehicle like a helicopter to
get<00:03:01.499> up<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:02.099> why<00:03:02.730> bother<00:03:02.969> when<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.989> can

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
get up there but why bother when you can

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.589 
get up there but why bother when you can
teleport<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.760> working<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.420> time

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
teleport and this is working at the time

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.209 
teleport and this is working at the time
of<00:03:06.749> the<00:03:06.810> release<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.319> video<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:07.920> could

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
of the release of this video they could

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.000 
of the release of this video they could
possibly<00:03:08.489> patch<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.569> if<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.680> discover

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
possibly patch it up if they discover

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
possibly patch it up if they discover
