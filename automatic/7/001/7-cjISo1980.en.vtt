00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello everyone today do not me 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.970
 will find for a video of dofus on 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:15.130
 I see dofus game that this game good ben 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:18.359
 here I ag to the top the top down 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.039
 12 I think of the best characters of 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.759
 dofus finally all the characters I'm going 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.150
 make them an investment 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.730
 good then the first the yop 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.659
 it is super strong effect of the attacks of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.300
 near you say take the c1 of one of 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.730
 classes the easiest to play but I 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.679
 you say damn idea loudly I you 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 strongly advise 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.820
 then there will be at the beginning you 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.190
 do you think he's not super strong 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.480
 since he loves school in tenth 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.839
 position it's not for nothing that I 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.390
 denies second place because at the start 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.870
 he is very close there becomes nil and after 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.050
 it comes back so that's what I'm doing 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.749
 tell me personally I pray them them 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.940
 ligament work will deposit 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.280
 pieces you for the opponent it's going 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 to blow but for you 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.560
 to be very good in third place we 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.670
 have the summoner have known more under 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.620
 the name of back daring me he invokes 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 locker room before the start he not 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.850
 great pg strong bug but you have 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.210
 you get to summon critters 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 reports after my character in 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.530
 character 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.340
 then in fourth position we have 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.170
 the flip state 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.450
 they play to be lucky but it is 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.010
 super strong and after one year he can 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.550
 invoke a kitten who arrives health 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.300
 go super classy I tell you he is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.720
 bold fat took fifth position 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:53.410
 sadida he is really very strong and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.420
 after he is against it is almost at 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.160
 tie with crack is in sixth 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 position and his power forwards 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.820
 and he is powerful tisbe with the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.530
 roots but there it looks like a 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.510
 little old grandpa are defense will read me 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.580
 strong then cra cra a market rather and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.610
 bailly the forces i'm taking the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.370
 a lot of people take me then c1 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.650
 2 3 4 5 7 6th position is in seventh 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.060
 position we have the sacred is paying that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.040
 without it's really the big boost of the game 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.170
 since it is little to take pv but 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 frankly they spit bitchy but 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 when you do not abhor it here is it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.020
 seventh position after the others 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.090
 characters I do not have any 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.830
 many taken except two then went into 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 eighth position view and m the dawa bread 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.709
 he's got me stuffed he's gonna he's 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.480
 rather a little good a good class is 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.590
 in ninth position bordering I did 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.680
 not taken a lot but I know they 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.940
 the forges to face renÃ©e nutr off 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.910
 then puts us in tenth position we 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.220
 have our balls at the ball in fact it is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.260
 practically tied with lenny trophe 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.739
 really very strong tenth position 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.320
 before the steamer he can invoke 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.540
 machines he's fighting and that machine 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.120
 exile you rather simpler take the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.709
 what you want to play with 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 machines of course I was in 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.940
 second position we have the exodus 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.040
 auris bike time it goes like a twink 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.790
 strong and strong in second place we 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.290
 have the rogue 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.570
 yeah he's going he's strong he's beating good 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.790
 but it's useless I beg them 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.860
 mean a person him then he must 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.140
 go back to level 90 for it to be 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.060
 strong and otherwise it is zero since they 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.769
 can only recover from father and his 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.000
 attacks to the amphi what are they saying then 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.750
 that he is known and while he is at 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 level 40 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.190
 he's forced to get in touch with people 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.370
 to win a lot of fights 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.060
 I do not have very strong and the last in 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.640
 14th position I believe the fact that at the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.370
 peasant down to him in fact he is not 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.390
 very strong it takes less time level 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.550
 95 points be strong now it's okay 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.400
 here is now I 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.080
 they are all these characters of dofus 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.270
 that I showed you are all strong at 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.500
 pretty much the iop a gesture is like 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.299
 you see but you can put it 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.310
 in other colors in the face 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.950
 like that you can put it red 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.980
 blue what thief you want you 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.620
