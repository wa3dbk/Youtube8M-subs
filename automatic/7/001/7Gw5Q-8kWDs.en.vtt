it's<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.920> strong<00:00:23.340> system<00:00:24.050> I'll<00:00:25.050> start

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it's a very strong system I'll start

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
it's a very strong system I'll start
here<00:00:25.619> by<00:00:25.769> showing<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> material<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.849> we

the United States and that's something

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
the United States and that's something
that<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.670> take<00:00:35.880> pride<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.960> entire

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that we really take pride in the entire

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.030 
that we really take pride in the entire
rack<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.890> 100%<00:00:38.750> u.s.<00:00:39.750> made<00:00:40.050> including<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
rack is 100% u.s. made including all the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.670 
rack is 100% u.s. made including all the
materials<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.500> some<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
materials that we use so some of the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.410 
materials that we use so some of the
features<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> rack<00:00:44.460> probably<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
features of the rack probably are the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
features of the rack probably are the
starting<00:00:46.230> point<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.710> I'd<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> show<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
starting point is I'd like to show you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420 
starting point is I'd like to show you
how<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.539> build<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.200> base<00:00:49.410> rail<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.950> Iraq<00:00:50.219> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
how we build the base rail of Iraq it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.410 
how we build the base rail of Iraq it's
a<00:00:50.520> full<00:00:50.940> length<00:00:51.440> angle<00:00:52.440> iron<00:00:52.890> base<00:00:53.730> rail<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a full length angle iron base rail and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
a full length angle iron base rail and
what<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.289> does<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> creates<00:00:56.070> maximum

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
what that does is it creates maximum

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.410 
what that does is it creates maximum
structural<00:00:57.660> integrity<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.649> helps<00:00:59.100> really

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
structural integrity it helps really

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
structural integrity it helps really
spread<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> load<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.170> along<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
spread that load out along the the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
spread that load out along the the
trucks<00:01:02.550> bed<00:01:02.730> rail<00:01:02.940> instead<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> having<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
trucks bed rail instead of having the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
trucks bed rail instead of having the
just<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> short<00:01:05.489> piece<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.880> angle<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> an

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
just a short piece of angle you have an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
just a short piece of angle you have an
entire<00:01:07.350> length<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.729> gives<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
entire length that really gives that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.740 
entire length that really gives that
maximum<00:01:09.689> support<00:01:11.030> going<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.270> front<00:01:12.540> here

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
maximum support going up front here

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
maximum support going up front here
another<00:01:12.990> area<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.760> support<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> rack<00:01:15.630> are

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
another area of support for the rack are

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.980 
another area of support for the rack are
these<00:01:16.049> gussets<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.280> gusset<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.479> overhang

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
these gussets we gusset the overhang

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
these gussets we gusset the overhang
section<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> rack<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.610> this
