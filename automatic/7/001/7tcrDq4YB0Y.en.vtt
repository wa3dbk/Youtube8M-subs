00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
went with a frosted color so it's as you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
can see I've already installed it and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.550 
can see I've already installed it and
I'm<00:00:27.300> gonna<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.660> video<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.349> bit

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
I'm gonna do this video a little bit

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.290 
I'm gonna do this video a little bit
differently<00:00:28.980> rather<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.609> show<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.910> how<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
differently rather than show you how you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080 
differently rather than show you how you
put<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.199> I'm<00:00:31.920> gonna<00:00:32.070> remove<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.669> because

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
put this on I'm gonna remove it because

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.389 
put this on I'm gonna remove it because
a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> times<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:34.079> these<00:00:34.230> types<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.130> cases

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a lot of times with these types of cases

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.150 
a lot of times with these types of cases
they<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.630> pretty<00:00:36.960> difficult<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.770> remove

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
they can be pretty difficult to remove

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
they can be pretty difficult to remove
and<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.540> don't<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:39.780> that's<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and I really don't think that's the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
and I really don't think that's the
situation<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.489> here's<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
situation with this one here's the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
situation with this one here's the
packaging<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.899> comes<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> can

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
packaging that it comes in and you can

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470 
packaging that it comes in and you can
see<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.969> nice<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
see it right here the nice thing that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
see it right here the nice thing that
they<00:00:45.780> did<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
they did and you don't see it here but

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
they did and you don't see it here but
there's<00:00:48.090> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> separator<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.079> so

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there's kind of a separator here so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.080 
there's kind of a separator here so
they've<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.100> instructions<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
they've got some instructions that you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
they've got some instructions that you
definitely<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.809> follow<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:53.190> are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
definitely need to follow when you are

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.299 
definitely need to follow when you are
putting<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.390> macbook<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
putting this on your macbook but it's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
putting this on your macbook but it's
nice<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> separator<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> there

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
nice that there's a separator in there

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
nice that there's a separator in there
because<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.710> two<00:00:58.859> pieces<00:00:59.160> aren't<00:00:59.550> clashing

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because the two pieces aren't clashing

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.290 
because the two pieces aren't clashing
together<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> transport<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> getting

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
together and transport and getting

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.549 
together and transport and getting
scratches<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.539> things<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
scratches or things like that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.700 
scratches or things like that
so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.729> case<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.540> least<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> situation

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so this case at least in the situation

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.700 
so this case at least in the situation
where<00:01:07.950> I've<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.270> frosted<00:01:09.990> is

kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> rubberized<00:01:45.240> feet<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.259> built

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
kind of rubberized feet that are built

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.450 
kind of rubberized feet that are built
in<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:48.630> gives<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.229> real<00:01:49.710> good<00:01:49.979> added

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in and that gives some real good added

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
in and that gives some real good added
grip<00:01:50.790> when<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> sitting<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> tabletop

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
grip when this is sitting on a tabletop

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
grip when this is sitting on a tabletop
or<00:01:52.979> anything<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> fit<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
or anything like that and the fit is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.770 
or anything like that and the fit is
really<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.590> nice<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:57.149> say<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really really nice I will say this it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
really really nice I will say this it's
a<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:58.020> tricky<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.329> correct

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
a bit tricky to get it on the correct

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
a bit tricky to get it on the correct
way<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.530> want<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> follow<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
way you really want to follow the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.149 
way you really want to follow the
instructions<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.409> demonstrate

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
instructions on how they demonstrate

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
instructions on how they demonstrate
inside<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.210> package<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> put<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> on

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
inside the package to put this on

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.309 
inside the package to put this on
otherwise<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.489> may<00:02:08.670> find<00:02:09.030> yourself<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
otherwise you may find yourself in a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.830 
otherwise you may find yourself in a
situation<00:02:10.530> where<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.340> couple<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.970> these<00:02:12.170> clips

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
situation where a couple of these clips

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.800 
situation where a couple of these clips
don't<00:02:14.080> fully<00:02:14.470> sentient<00:02:15.130> into<00:02:15.520> place<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.420> had

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
don't fully sentient into place so I had

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.650 
don't fully sentient into place so I had
to<00:02:16.900> find<00:02:17.110> myself<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.180> taking<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.420> case

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
to find myself going and taking the case

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.600 
to find myself going and taking the case
off<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.290> putting<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.650> back<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> couple<00:02:21.520> of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
off and putting it back on a couple of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.150 
off and putting it back on a couple of
times<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.349> what<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.560> wanted<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
times to get it to do what I wanted to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.580 
times to get it to do what I wanted to
do<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:25.150> gonna<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.510> ahead<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> remove

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
do now I'm gonna go ahead and remove

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.070 
do now I'm gonna go ahead and remove
this<00:02:27.040> you're<00:02:27.670> gonna<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.540> really<00:02:28.959> not

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
this you're gonna see it's really not

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410 
this you're gonna see it's really not
all<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.410> difficult<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.310> want<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.910> kind

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
all that difficult you just want to kind

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.490 
all that difficult you just want to kind
of<00:02:31.510> pry<00:02:31.900> where<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.500> find<00:02:32.860> those<00:02:33.250> edges<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.410> in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
of pry where you find those edges and in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.830 
of pry where you find those edges and in
this<00:02:35.680> case<00:02:35.980> I'm<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.819> working<00:02:37.330> my<00:02:37.450> way<00:02:37.480> all

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
this case I'm just working my way all

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.479 
this case I'm just working my way all
the<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:37.989> around<00:02:38.110> now<00:02:38.470> keep<00:02:38.769> in<00:02:38.950> mind<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.370> I'm

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
the way around now keep in mind as I'm

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.759 
the way around now keep in mind as I'm
doing<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.940> I'm<00:02:40.390> also<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.080> angle<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.650> I

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
doing this I'm also at an angle as I

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.680 
doing this I'm also at an angle as I
film<00:02:42.069> this<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.700> I'm<00:02:43.120> kind<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.540> at<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
film this so I'm kind of at a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
film this so I'm kind of at a
disadvantage<00:02:44.280> doing<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:46.090> way<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.160> pop

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
disadvantage doing it this way as I pop

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120 
disadvantage doing it this way as I pop
each<00:02:48.640> one<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.000> these<00:02:49.090> edges<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.860> just

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
each one of these edges this is just

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.240 
each one of these edges this is just
coming<00:02:51.370> straight<00:02:51.970> up<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.480> straight<00:02:53.319> off<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
coming straight up and straight off so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.740 
coming straight up and straight off so
you<00:02:54.310> saw<00:02:54.549> in<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.760> video<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.330> removal

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
you saw in this video that the removal

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.539 
you saw in this video that the removal
process<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.470> case<00:02:56.709> really<00:02:57.010> isn't<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
process of this case really isn't that

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.820 
process of this case really isn't that
difficult<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.209> that's<00:02:58.330> nice<00:02:58.569> because<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.470> have

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
difficult and that's nice because I have

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.220 
difficult and that's nice because I have
tried<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.130> couple<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.459> other<00:03:00.580> brands<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.330> cases

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
tried a couple of other brands of cases

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.050 
tried a couple of other brands of cases
like<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.099> can<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.700> chore<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
like this and they can be a chore to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
like this and they can be a chore to
take<00:03:04.360> off<00:03:04.569> that's<00:03:04.870> not<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> situation<00:03:05.440> with

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
take off that's not the situation with

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.670 
take off that's not the situation with
this<00:03:06.160> one<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.610> anything<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.720> will<00:03:07.959> say<00:03:08.260> when<00:03:08.650> you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
this one if anything I will say when you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.949 
this one if anything I will say when you
are<00:03:08.920> installing<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.730> case<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.269> really<00:03:10.630> want

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
are installing this case you really want

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.180 
are installing this case you really want
to<00:03:11.049> follow<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.440> instructions<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.130> their

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
to follow the instructions of their

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.009 
to follow the instructions of their
inside<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.819> box<00:03:13.030> because<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.810> don't

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
inside of the box because if you don't

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.140 
inside of the box because if you don't
you<00:03:14.739> might<00:03:14.950> run<00:03:15.130> into<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.430> situation<00:03:15.640> where

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you might run into a situation where

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.509 
you might run into a situation where
some<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.480> these<00:03:16.859> clips<00:03:17.859> they're<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.340> going<00:03:18.489> to

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
some of these clips they're not going to

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.160 
some of these clips they're not going to
fit<00:03:18.820> correctly<00:03:19.180> or<00:03:19.750> they're<00:03:19.870> not<00:03:19.959> going<00:03:20.109> to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
fit correctly or they're not going to

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.870 
fit correctly or they're not going to
snap<00:03:20.500> into<00:03:20.739> place<00:03:20.950> or<00:03:21.250> they're<00:03:21.370> gonna<00:03:21.459> want<00:03:21.790> to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
snap into place or they're gonna want to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.479 
snap into place or they're gonna want to
unsnap<00:03:22.359> so<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.680> sure<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.190> follow

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
unsnap so really be sure that you follow
