some we're going to talk about tools and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
some we're going to talk about tools and
your<00:00:32.070> yarn<00:00:35.090> start<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.870> need

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
your yarn start to start with you need

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
your yarn start to start with you need
to<00:00:37.079> learn<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.070> tension<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.570> my

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to learn your tension way I do my

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.440 
to learn your tension way I do my
tension<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.440> wrap<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> around<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.129> pinky

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
tension is I wrap it around my pinky

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
tension is I wrap it around my pinky
around<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.780> pointer<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.710> hold<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
around my pointer and then I hold the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.310 
around my pointer and then I hold the
tail<00:00:45.420> between<00:00:45.690> my<00:00:45.960> thumb<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:48.110> my<00:00:49.110> middle

tail between my thumb and my middle

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.660 
tail between my thumb and my middle
finger<00:00:50.989> okay<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
finger okay and then the way I make a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
finger okay and then the way I make a
slipknot<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.870> behind<00:00:56.030> maybe<00:00:57.030> zoom<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
slipknot is I go behind maybe zoom in

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.240 
slipknot is I go behind maybe zoom in
just<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:58.800> bit

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.460 

go<00:01:02.250> behind<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.149> thread<00:01:03.660> between<00:01:03.840> my<00:01:04.199> middle

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
go behind the thread between my middle

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.520 
go behind the thread between my middle
finger<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:04.949> pointer<00:01:05.960> hook<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> pull<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
finger and my pointer hook and pull it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
finger and my pointer hook and pull it
up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
up

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.179 
up
I<00:01:08.360> do<00:01:09.360> 180<00:01:10.290> degrees<00:01:10.909> turn<00:01:13.369> came<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.760> finger

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
I do 180 degrees turn came off my finger

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
I do 180 degrees turn came off my finger
and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> catch<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.750> yarn<00:01:20.600> underneath

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and then I catch the yarn underneath

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then I catch the yarn underneath
like<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> hold<00:01:23.040> onto<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
like this and then I hold onto that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.270 
like this and then I hold onto that
little<00:01:23.909> knot<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.200> pull<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> through<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little knot and then pull it through and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
little knot and then pull it through and
that<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> slipknot

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that is a slipknot

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289 
that is a slipknot
it<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.619> also<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.950> counted<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> chain<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it can also be counted as a chain if you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170 
it can also be counted as a chain if you
don't<00:01:30.479> pull<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> tight<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.939> there's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
don't pull it tight okay now there's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.100 
don't pull it tight okay now there's
another<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> making<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.290> slipknot<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
another way of making a slipknot and

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.700 
another way of making a slipknot and
that<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.710> cross<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.250> over<00:01:39.409> like<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that is you just cross it over like this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
that is you just cross it over like this
I<00:01:42.170> take<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> fold<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> yarn<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> half<00:01:45.829> twist

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
I take it I fold the yarn in half twist

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
I take it I fold the yarn in half twist
it<00:01:46.979> away<00:01:47.189> from<00:01:47.430> me<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> tail<00:01:48.840> that's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it away from me and then the tail that's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.819 
it away from me and then the tail that's
hanging<00:01:49.350> down

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
hanging down

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.260 
hanging down
push<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.119> through<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.990> loop<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:53.070> pull

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
push that up through the loop and pull

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.639 
push that up through the loop and pull
it<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.990> pull<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> tight

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it up and then you pull that tight

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.550 
it up and then you pull that tight
that's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> slip<00:01:57.030> knot<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> slip<00:01:58.200> knot<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's a slip knot and that slip knot is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.170 
that's a slip knot and that slip knot is
not<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> count<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> stitch<00:01:59.670> because

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
not going to count as a stitch because

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840 
not going to count as a stitch because
it's<00:02:00.360> tight<00:02:01.189> okay<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.250> there's<00:02:02.670> different

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it's tight okay so there's different

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's tight okay so there's different
ways<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> I'll<00:02:04.350> use<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.280> or

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
ways to do it and I'll use one or all or

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.479 
ways to do it and I'll use one or all or
different<00:02:06.060> ways<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.439> stitching<00:02:07.890> as

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
different ways when I do my stitching as

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.889 
different ways when I do my stitching as
long<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.179> loop<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:09.750> hook

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
long as you got that loop on your hook

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
long as you got that loop on your hook
that's<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> most<00:02:10.590> important<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:12.330> want

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that's the most important thing you want

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
that's the most important thing you want
to<00:02:12.629> make<00:02:12.959> sure<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.410> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to make sure that it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220 
to make sure that it
is<00:02:13.830> loose<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.240> slide<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.840> back<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.050> forth

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
is loose you can slide it back and forth

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.830

lip I'm going to do a chain four so what
you<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.050> chain<00:02:46.530> four<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.490> yarn<00:02:47.790> over

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you do to chain four is you yarn over

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.510 
you do to chain four is you yarn over
your<00:02:48.240> hook<00:02:48.300> which<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.230> kind<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> scoop<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
your hook which is to kind of scoop the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.450 
your hook which is to kind of scoop the
yarn<00:02:51.120> around<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.540> hook<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.460> draw

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
yarn around the hook and you draw

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.410 
yarn around the hook and you draw
through<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:55.020> loop<00:02:55.760> let<00:02:56.760> me<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.270> it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
through that loop let me do it take it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.320 
through that loop let me do it take it
out<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:57.990> again

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
out and do it again

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.640 
out and do it again
scoop<00:03:01.100> catch<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.580> hook<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.200> pull

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
scoop catch it in the hook then you pull

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.140 
scoop catch it in the hook then you pull
it<00:03:04.800> through<00:03:04.830> by<00:03:05.220> twisting<00:03:05.730> your<00:03:05.790> hook<00:03:05.970> down

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it through by twisting your hook down

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.350 
it through by twisting your hook down
slightly<00:03:08.870> let's<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:10.110> one<00:03:10.440> chain<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.120> do

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
slightly let's do one chain then you do

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.420 
slightly let's do one chain then you do
that<00:03:12.510> again<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.600> called<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.900> yarn<00:03:16.170> over

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that again this is called a yarn over

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.160 
that again this is called a yarn over
which<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.610> basically<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.360> go<00:03:18.510> take<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.960> yarn

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
which is basically you go take the yarn

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.840 
which is basically you go take the yarn
over<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> hook<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.040> at<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> same<00:03:20.640> time

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
over the hook but at the same time

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.000 
over the hook but at the same time
you're<00:03:21.090> using<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.540> hook<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.500> under<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you're using the hook to go under the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.360 
you're using the hook to go under the
yarn<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> scoop<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.770> bring<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
yarn and you scoop it and you bring it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.680 
yarn and you scoop it and you bring it
downwards<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.060> two<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> see<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.450> two

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
downwards that's two so I see I have two

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.840 
downwards that's two so I see I have two
chains<00:03:30.990> right<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:32.370> don't<00:03:32.550> count<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
chains right there you don't count the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.210 
chains right there you don't count the
one<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.450> hook<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:34.890> it

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
one that's on the hook you now do it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.260 
one that's on the hook you now do it
again<00:03:35.900> three<00:03:38.000> yarn<00:03:39.000> over<00:03:39.590> catch<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.890> yarn

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
again three yarn over catch the yarn

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.400 
again three yarn over catch the yarn
push<00:03:42.270> your<00:03:42.480> hook<00:03:42.570> downward<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:46.050> pull<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
push your hook downward and pull it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.630 
push your hook downward and pull it
through<00:03:46.550> there<00:03:47.550> you've<00:03:47.700> got<00:03:47.730> four<00:03:48.180> chains

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
through there you've got four chains

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.250 
through there you've got four chains
okay<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.210> want<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.540> practice<00:03:51.780> making

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
okay and I want you to practice making

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.140 
okay and I want you to practice making
chains<00:03:52.740> like<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> till<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.850> come<00:03:54.030> out

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
chains like that till they come out

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.050 
chains like that till they come out
pretty<00:03:54.210> even<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:55.320> look<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.680> V's<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
pretty even they look like V's on the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.720 
pretty even they look like V's on the
front<00:03:57.330> almost<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> braid<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.580> you

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
front almost like a braid but then you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.200 
front almost like a braid but then you
look<00:03:59.880> at<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> back<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.970> there's<00:04:02.970> where

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
look at the back of it and there's where

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.760 
look at the back of it and there's where
you<00:04:03.270> can<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.720> looks<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:03.960> a<00:04:04.050> chain<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.740> has

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
you can see it looks like a chain it has

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.180 
you can see it looks like a chain it has
a<00:04:05.750> loop<00:04:06.750> at<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.020> top<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.380> loop<00:04:07.800> at<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:07.980> bottom

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
a loop at the top a loop at the bottom

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.449 
a loop at the top a loop at the bottom
and<00:04:08.550> one<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.910> bump<00:04:09.180> coming<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.959> middle<00:04:10.430> okay

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and one a bump coming up the middle okay

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.940 
and one a bump coming up the middle okay
the<00:04:11.880> front<00:04:12.180> side<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.660> one<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.290> faces<00:04:13.740> you

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
the front side is one that faces you

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.210 
the front side is one that faces you
should<00:04:14.250> be<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.520> side<00:04:14.730> with<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> V's<00:04:16.010> alright

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
should be the side with the V's alright

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.890 
should be the side with the V's alright
now<00:04:17.700> what<00:04:17.880> we're<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.420> is<00:04:18.660> we're

now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.080> form<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.650> circle<00:04:20.100> with<00:04:20.850> these<00:04:21.060> four

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
going to form a circle with these four

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.290 
going to form a circle with these four
chains<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.160> go<00:04:23.160> into<00:04:23.490> your<00:04:23.580> first<00:04:23.910> stitch

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
chains and you go into your first stitch

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.390 
chains and you go into your first stitch
just<00:04:25.370> poke<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.550> hook

first chain to see there's 1 2 3 4
chains<00:04:34.440> go<00:04:35.440> back<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.280> first<00:04:36.580> one<00:04:36.729> coming

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
chains go back to that first one coming

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.409 
chains go back to that first one coming
out<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.570> Slipknot<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:39.039> go<00:04:40.000> underneath

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
out of the Slipknot and go underneath

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.980 
out of the Slipknot and go underneath
that<00:04:40.570> little<00:04:41.229> loop<00:04:41.380> right<00:04:41.590> there<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.750> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
that little loop right there and you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.770 
that little loop right there and you
catch<00:04:44.259> up<00:04:44.470> your<00:04:44.680> yarn<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:46.180> want<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.509> do<00:04:46.630> it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
catch up your yarn and you want to do it

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.150 
catch up your yarn and you want to do it
a<00:04:46.870> yarn<00:04:47.080> over<00:04:47.440> back<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.070> front<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:50.770> strap<00:04:51.039> it

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
a yarn over back to front we strap it

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.499 
a yarn over back to front we strap it
down<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.340> little<00:04:51.699> bit<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.240> pull<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.810> through<00:04:54.509> ok

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
down a little bit and pull it through ok

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.120 
down a little bit and pull it through ok
and<00:04:55.750> see<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.199> first<00:04:56.500> loop<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.919> want<00:04:57.009> to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
and see that first loop you want to

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.740 
and see that first loop you want to
bring<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.370> through<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.880> second<00:04:58.270> loop<00:04:58.419> by

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
bring it through the second loop by

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.650 
bring it through the second loop by
pulling<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.320> down<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.560> through<00:05:00.360> now<00:05:01.360> if<00:05:01.510> you

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
pulling it down and through now if you

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.650 
pulling it down and through now if you
look<00:05:01.900> carefully<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:04.000> doesn't<00:05:04.330> look<00:05:04.419> like<00:05:04.630> a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
look carefully it doesn't look like a

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.629 
look carefully it doesn't look like a
loop<00:05:04.990> does<00:05:05.289> it<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:05.710> there<00:05:05.949> is<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.370> hole<00:05:06.789> in<00:05:08.639> the

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
loop does it but there is a hole in the

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.960 
loop does it but there is a hole in the
middle<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.120> circle<00:05:10.949> pull<00:05:11.949> it<00:05:12.100> out<00:05:12.280> you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
middle of that circle pull it out you

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.610 
middle of that circle pull it out you
can<00:05:13.180> see<00:05:13.389> it<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:16.479> do<00:05:16.539> have<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> video<00:05:17.320> that's

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
can see it and I do have a video that's

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.100 
can see it and I do have a video that's
a<00:05:17.889> tip<00:05:18.160> on<00:05:18.340> how<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.639> find<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.449> hole<00:05:19.690> on<00:05:19.900> how<00:05:20.050> to

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
a tip on how to find that hole on how to

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.080 
a tip on how to find that hole on how to
keep<00:05:20.380> track<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.889> it<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:23.430> that's<00:05:24.430> our<00:05:24.669> set<00:05:24.910> to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
keep track of it so that's our set to

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.020 
keep track of it so that's our set to
our<00:05:25.180> circle<00:05:25.680> so<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.220> step<00:05:27.460> 1

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
our circle so this is the step 1

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.870 
our circle so this is the step 1
I'm<00:05:28.650> going<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.770> stop<00:05:29.979> this<00:05:30.130> video<00:05:30.280> now<00:05:30.610> and

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
I'm going to stop this video now and

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:41.559 
I'm going to stop this video now and
we'll<00:05:31.150> go<00:05:31.360> on<00:05:31.570> to<00:05:31.690> step<00:05:31.870> 2<00:05:32.139> on<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> next<00:05:32.650> video
