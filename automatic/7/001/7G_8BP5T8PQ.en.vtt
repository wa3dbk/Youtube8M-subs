00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.309
 dry mix coral 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.429
 represent the new coral stone system 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.670
 decor for decoration of buildings and structures 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.450
 natural as it includes 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.510
 special glue for stone grout for 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.880
 seams and matt varnish protection for 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.130
 underlines of natural beauty can 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.190
 now you don't need to wrestle with 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 so what to glue the stone as beautiful 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 make stitches and highlight beauty 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.270
 natural stone structure 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.270
 foundation preparation 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.260
 first we examine the surface 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.609
 the base must be dry and durable without 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.879
 visible destruction 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:57.000
 clear from the influx of oil stains 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.780
 and other substances that reduce adhesion 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.180
 i.e. material adhesion to the base 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 also remove bumps and frail 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.159
 ground areas 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.680
 if there are cracks spat greasy 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.189
 stains residues of olives or polymeric 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 paints 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 remove solvent temperature 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.759
 grounds must be from + 5 to plus 30 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.759
 degrees Celsius 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.490
 priming after we have cleared 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.030
 we put the bases deeply getting 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.460
 primer cpp 8 before application 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.510
 mix well and in packaging and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.510
 pour in a bucket 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.030
 then take a big brush or roller and 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.670
 we put a primer on the basis of one 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 layer if the surface is porous with 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.700
 high absorbency characteristics 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 apply 2 coats of primer coral deep 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 penetrates the base in this way 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.960
 strengthen it also priming 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.950
 surface will allow to increase adhesion 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.780
 grip followed by a layer and reduce 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.490
 base water absorption 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.130
 will take water from materials 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.830
 which will be applied on top of such 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.810
 as a putty or glue after application 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.400
 cd8 coral primer 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:25.489
 give dry for 4 6 hours 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.250
 preparing for me before gluing 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.430
 rinse the stone thoroughly with 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.599
 using stiff brushes and water as well 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.060
 to dry 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.730
 it is necessary to remove 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:45.519
 dust which significantly reduces adhesion 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.519
 stone preparation of adhesive solution 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.069
 knead adhesive mixture measure off 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.010
 the required amount of pure water and 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.750
 dry mix in the proportions indicated on 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 screen we fall asleep dry glue and 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.420
 stirring low speed drill up 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.889
 formation of a homogeneous mass without lumps 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.709
 then we maintain the resulting mortar 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.250
 mixture for five minutes after which 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.799
 mix the adhesive mixture again 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.370
 will use for two hours 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.739
 in the same way cook then measure out 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.919
 the required amount of pure water and 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.500
 dry mix in the proportions indicated on 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.169
 screen to get the desired color 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.370
 grout which will allow to emphasize 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.430
 stone relief 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.760
 add the necessary pigment during kneading 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.459
 that is, call our grout 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.620
 can be used for 1 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.169
 o'clock 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.419
 mix and ready to work case 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.889
 thickening of the mortar mixture and its 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.229
 need to mix 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.610
 low speed drill but by no means 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:04:00.670
 case do not add water 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:03.240
 glued stone sticking 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.870
 the mixture using the flat side of the spatula 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.600
 we put on the wall 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.230
 after which we level the glue layer 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.420
 serrated side for 20 minutes with 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.920
 the time of application of the adhesive solution on 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.480
 wall must be glued stone 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.480
 we put a stone and we press 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.320
 now we put on the edges glued 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.990
 stone 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.460
 a thick layer of grout metal 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.110
 trowel width 30 50 millimeters and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.580
 We put the next stone picking up 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.650
 according to the form, if necessary, we give the stone 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.490
 necessary edge shape beating the edges 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.490
 hammer 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.580
 after gluing leave to dry 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.930
 stripping him 24 hours after 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.849
 gluing 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.129
 scouring protruding grout with 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.270
 trowel width 20 30 millimeters 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.860
 recommend using a spatula with 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.860
 radially rounded edges 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.460
 24 hours after stripping 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:15.240
 remove the grout from the surface 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.240
 stone using hard brushes and water 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.220
 applying varnish 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.430
 in order to emphasize natural 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.460
 stone color and pattern as well as protect 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.190
 stone from moisture need 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.450
 apply matt varnish protection for 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.970
 natural stone 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.250
 coral ctp 12 before applying carefully 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.550
 mix and and pack 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:51.050
 then take a big brush or roller and 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.050
 uniformly apply varnish on the stone 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:09.490
 leave to dry now you can 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.490
 admire the beauty of natural stone
