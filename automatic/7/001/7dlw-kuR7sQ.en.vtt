00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869

we don't have the same number of slalom
paddlers<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.590> think<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.920> has<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.159> do<00:01:25.399> and

paddlers and I think that has to do and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.820 
paddlers and I think that has to do and
that<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.149> don't<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.659> number<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.200> white

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830

to go to and learn the basics of
whitewater<00:02:03.319> paddling<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.009> what's<00:02:04.220> cool

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
whitewater paddling and what's cool

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.100 
whitewater paddling and what's cool
about<00:02:04.489> it<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.849> at<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> same<00:02:05.090> time<00:02:05.270> we<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.750> our

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
about it is at the same time we have our

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.380 
about it is at the same time we have our
national<00:02:07.009> team<00:02:07.280> athletes<00:02:07.670> or<00:02:07.879> training<00:02:08.270> on

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
national team athletes or training on

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.440 
national team athletes or training on
the<00:02:08.509> same<00:02:08.750> piece<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.259> whitewater<00:02:10.420> basically<00:02:11.420> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
the same piece of whitewater basically a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.229 
the same piece of whitewater basically a
slalom<00:02:12.110> course<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.250> series<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:14.000> gates

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
slalom course is this series of gates

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.260 
slalom course is this series of gates
and<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.349> gates<00:02:15.620> are<00:02:15.800> hung<00:02:16.069> from<00:02:16.700> wires<00:02:16.970> above

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and the gates are hung from wires above

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.869 
and the gates are hung from wires above
the<00:02:17.810> river<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.980> gates<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.370> positioned

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
the river and the gates are positioned

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.760 
the river and the gates are positioned
in<00:02:19.970> ways<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.209> will<00:02:20.599> challenge<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.260> paddlers

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
in ways that will challenge the paddlers

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.880 
in ways that will challenge the paddlers
to<00:02:22.069> get<00:02:22.580> down<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> river<00:02:23.470> wait<00:02:24.470> about<00:02:24.830> six

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to get down the river wait about six

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.770 
to get down the river wait about six
days<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> week<00:02:25.519> at<00:02:25.730> most<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.330> doing<00:02:26.599> two

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
days a week at most a for doing two

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.110 
days a week at most a for doing two

one in the gym or two in the water

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
one in the gym or two in the water
but<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.730> know<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.940> doesn't<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:34.550> find<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.820> when

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I'm on the water paddling by myself I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.220 
I'm on the water paddling by myself I
sort<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.050> i<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.500> into<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:40.890> zone<00:02:41.180> this

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
sort of i can get into this zone this

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.500 
sort of i can get into this zone this
flow<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.010> can't<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.790> find<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.360> any

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
flow that I can't really find in any

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.060 
flow that I can't really find in any
other<00:02:45.630> part<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.350> life<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:48.360> want<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:49.070> get
