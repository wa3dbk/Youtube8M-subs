 old videos still like that then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.159
 works so you just close 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.979
 your cellphone or whatever with that 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.360
 usb connector to the usb port and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.159

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.380
 few facts of the 12,000

 milliamperes are about 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.990
 six to seven 100 percent of the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 Charge status from an iphone 4s or 3gs 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.299
 200 to 250 from the google nexus 750 from 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.400
 ipad 72 from ipad 3 that means you can 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.510
