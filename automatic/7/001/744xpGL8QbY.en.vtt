00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 all right 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.310
 and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 this philosopher became a legend 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.700
 when he was still living the rumors 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.860
 transformed into a prophet and then into 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.320
 a scammer sometimes made him 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.349
 hero of anecdotes and others took him 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 by crazy I do not believe any doctrine 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.369
 integral but his whole life was a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.369
 example of serving philosophy 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 diogenes the natural synod cynical 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.570
 the dog was also called diogenes 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.780
 this philosopher lived in the fourth century 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.449
 before Christ 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.489
 it is known that his father was a coiner of 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.440
 currency and his whole family came from 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.440
 synod territory of the current turkey 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 when diogenes was still young it was 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.760
 accused of adulterating the coins and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 sent into exile outside his city and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 ojÃ©n is not denied his part of fault but 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.140
 what were the reasons why a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.660
 young man from a wealthy family acted like this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 according to the legend the reason why 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.650
 fake coins was not to get 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 benefits but to follow the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.080
 Delphi oracle instructions 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.270
 the young diogenes went to the oracle and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 he made a blatant question of what 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 I must do to make myself famous 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.140
 oracle responded to change the value of the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.060
 currency 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 diogenes took the prophecy at the foot of the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 letter the oracle became the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.020
 cynical slogan and metaphor of good 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 part of the behavior of the philosopher 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 expelled from his fate such a diogenes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.179
 traveled to Athens where he met the philosopher 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.179
 Greek artist in is the founder of cynicism 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 artist considered that man 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 should be detached from the prejudices that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.939
 they inculcate him to free themselves from the laws 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.980
 of society and live like a dog 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.170
 street 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.020
 the chemical word chemical which 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.730
 derived from kim means dog all 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.220
 followers of the philosophy of artists 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.080
 they would be called as kinicks the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.450
 word cynicism which comes from the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.250
 philosophical teachings of the kinicks in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.440
 the news has obtained a new 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.660
 meaning now not only defines the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.730
 action to deny social laws but 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.420
 also describes the action of denying the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.970
 existing moral and cultural laws 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.099
 diogenes became the best student 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.200
 of artist he is convinced that the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.720
 virtue was to abstain from 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.450
 needs and asceticism diogenes 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.090
 released his only slave changed his 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.370
 clothes for rustic clothes was made 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.760
 with a wallet and started living in the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.760
 streets 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.960
 in winter he used to sleep in the porches 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.150
 and public squares and in summer I slept in 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.340
 the sand heated by the sun 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.950
 diogenes lived a life tight to the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.230
 ideals of cynicism even came to 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 reproach his teacher for not following his 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.270
 own doctrines and not appreciate the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.600
 deprivations as a means of rectification 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.600
 moral 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.310
 diogenes stopped traveling through greece 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.370
 when they asked him where he was coming from 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.890
 I always answered, I'm cosmopolitan 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.379
 I am a citizen of the world in a 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.310
 occasion the lonely and helpless 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.110
 preacher fell into the hands of pirates will 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.530
 sold as a slave to a rich man of 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.959
 Corinth called geniales 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.330
 his new master did not take long to appreciate the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.250
 special knowledge of the philosopher and you 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 arranged as guardian of his children 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.640
 despite all the hardships he had 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.160
 that living diogenes was always faithful to its 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.350
 Cynic philosophy continues as a slave 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.170
 until the day of his death but since 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.750
 he appreciated his inner freedom that never 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.210
 he made him unhappy diogenes came to the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.130
 end of his asceticism on one occasion 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.560
 after seeing a child drink from the bowl of 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.050
 his hands destroyed the bowl so 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.320
 that was his only possession besides his 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.180
 layer whispered and his staff the philosopher 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.519
 I thought that the man did not need anything 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.709
 staff because everything needed is 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.870
 gave at birth the philosopher 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.940
 known as diogenes the dog will 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.850
 it behaved like a stray animal 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.580
 he rejected public laws and challenged 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.470
 the traditions already established too 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.510
 it is said that the philosopher lived in a 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.580
 barrel and that sunny days I walked 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.040
 with a torch when they asked him 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.200
 the reason for this he answered I'm 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.220
 looking for an honest man 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.010
 people always told him diogenes already 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.640
 you're too old it's time to 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.640
 that you calm down 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.840
 but the philosopher answered 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.849
 I'm almost finished now it's time 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.849
 to run not to stop 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.160
 his peculiar lifestyle his extreme 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.800
 acuity and its irresistible energy 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.610
 they made the philosopher a legend of the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.740
 ancient greece 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.830
 of the many elected ones saw to see the 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.740
 philosopher Alexander the Great found the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.340
 philosopher resting in a cypress near 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.340
 of corinth 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.310
 the omnipotent alejandro went to 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.710
 saying diogenes can fire me everything 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.020
 whatever you wish 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.440
 then the sharp tongue of diogenes 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.580
 he replied I wish you to move away 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.860
 covering the sun 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.680
 historical chronicles claim that the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.080
 philosopher lived to an advanced age 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.199
 the prophecy of the oracle of Delphi 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.539
 fulfilled the life of the philosopher challenge the 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.780
 bases of society and question the 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.680
 public morals turned him into all 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.680
 a legend 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.139
 the cynical philosopher of synod 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.990
 became the symbol of freedom and 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.780
 happiness even the omnipotent 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.360
 'alejandro magnno' being on the edge of the 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.789
 Death said if it was not Alexander 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.789
 I would have liked to be diogenes
