to<00:00:04.959> change<00:00:05.169> it<00:00:05.410> out<00:00:05.560> because<00:00:06.279> I<00:00:06.490> didn't<00:00:06.899> really

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899

like<00:00:08.109> the<00:00:08.230> weight<00:00:08.410> was<00:00:08.650> rotated<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.719> I'm<00:00:10.870> if

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
like the weight was rotated so I'm if

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.560 
like the weight was rotated so I'm if
you<00:00:11.230> had<00:00:11.769> 2<00:00:12.190> L<00:00:12.370> brackets<00:00:12.820> coming<00:00:13.120> up<00:00:13.240> on<00:00:13.389> both

you had 2 L brackets coming up on both
sides<00:00:13.809> we<00:00:14.019> disconnected<00:00:14.589> to<00:00:14.679> the<00:00:14.799> other

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889

this change gonna come around and then
I'm<00:01:20.020> gonna<00:01:20.230> connect<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.160> this<00:01:21.280> chain

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
I'm gonna connect this to this chain

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.420 
I'm gonna connect this to this chain
somehow<00:01:22.000> just<00:01:22.510> gonna<00:01:22.770> pull<00:01:23.770> with<00:01:24.310> the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
somehow just gonna pull with the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.590 
somehow just gonna pull with the
joystick<00:01:26.130> hopefully<00:01:27.130> will<00:01:27.340> take<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.760> engine

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
joystick hopefully will take this engine

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.110 
joystick hopefully will take this engine
will<00:01:29.080> just<00:01:29.340> play<00:01:30.340> back<00:01:30.550> here<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.730> little<00:01:30.760> better

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
will just play back here a little better

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.030 
will just play back here a little better
cuz<00:01:31.960> I'm<00:01:32.050> have<00:01:32.200> more<00:01:32.440> clearance

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
cuz I'm have more clearance

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.690 
cuz I'm have more clearance
I'm<00:01:33.280> will<00:01:33.460> clinic<00:01:33.730> but<00:01:33.970> some<00:01:34.510> more<00:01:34.720> leverage

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
I'm will clinic but some more leverage

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290 
I'm will clinic but some more leverage
at<00:01:36.700> first<00:01:36.970> these<00:01:37.270> were<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:39.520> getting

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
at first these were well I'm getting

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.240 
at first these were well I'm getting
about<00:01:40.450> an<00:01:40.690> inch<00:01:40.840> more<00:01:41.260> on<00:01:41.470> each<00:01:41.620> side<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:41.890> that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
about an inch more on each side so that

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.080 
about an inch more on each side so that
she<00:01:42.430> would<00:01:42.550> be<00:01:42.780> should<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:43.960> returned<00:01:44.260> easier

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
she would be should have returned easier

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.340 
she would be should have returned easier
I<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> big<00:01:45.689> bigger<00:01:46.969> diameter<00:01:48.229> should<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
I have a big bigger diameter should I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.910 
I have a big bigger diameter should I
could<00:01:49.500> turn<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.039> easier<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
could turn a little bit easier but on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.569 
could turn a little bit easier but on
that's<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.399> alright<00:01:53.609> now<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> whenever

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that's about it alright now and whenever

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.529 
that's about it alright now and whenever
