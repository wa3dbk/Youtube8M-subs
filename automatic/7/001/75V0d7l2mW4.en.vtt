 So neither conference was said before nor before the demand 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.590
 because it's great that you are only from 4 it in the foreground and first 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.880
 to reenter the pandemic 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.870
 what this new so first 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.520
 beforehand that has 4 he is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.530
 a hair he is Dior around 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.460
 only that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.930
 that would use 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.200

 % EBIT 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.979
 So megabits per second reached 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.979
 that's actually a proud one 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.529
 Finally, one would have said 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.680

 So that sounds never tried 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:42.989
 around 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.329
 Videos should then with this sensor in high definition so a thousand 80 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.299
 can be included and are therefore 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.679
 So by doing so would like 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.419

 say the program or open the program to stop the weather at and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.359
 Although then directly on how the weather is 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.659
 But you can also just ask questions years, I need these things or 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.659

 there is the 4 percent he supports both the gsm and the cdma network 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.330
 should it be said that it can also be used worldwide 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.059
 at Xing, you just can not stand it 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.509
 Well the prices are very high 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.789
 they would have the iPhone 4s 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.389
 Percent will be in the 16-gigabyte version for $ 200 as well as $ 99 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.319
 he has led us out of 99 dollars 109 $ 90 the 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:10.129
 16-gigabyte variant 294 92 and the four are the local councils for 379 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.309
 Euro now has it too 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:13.169
 ume 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.139
 the year so 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.300
 Although already pitch bad amount to pursue and I have already 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.069
 that's just percent 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.550
 Percent fixes and horror that's already open, we're not looking forward to starting 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.349
 and finally it starts 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.389
 Yes 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.430
 so far 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.389
 so rested of course in the competence was no longer about the new 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.270
 iPhone or the iPhone percent successor now percent talked but 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.749
 also about other things 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.370
 for example, percent that around David Rott Dr 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.980
 Percent the most popular game console console should be percent 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.990
 had compared to Sony Sum go and thus the Moody s 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.630
 And yes, sales figures and market share a lot of bells and whistles 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.350
 So you can read it like that, so I hope it's over 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.319
 that's the percent preview here 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.520
