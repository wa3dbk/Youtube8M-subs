 [Music] 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.990
 [Applause] 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.299
 here monster or droid and I just 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.920
 find out that a celebration 0.9 point two 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.240
 dismissal a thousand apologies and I was going to late 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.189
 take the page through or put it 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.170
 because well all morning again 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.570
 three to be a team see crazy with this 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.910
 the rains and the light but good this one 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.990
 want to see extract how come back I'm in 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.060
 the home screen to see that 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.800
 says to do point 9.2 and good what 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.350
 news brings brings news with the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.440
 performance we're not going to enter you for 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.289
 that they see and we continue 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.329
 and one as I told you there are new things with 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.809
 what is the generation of worlds 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.670
 apparently no longer will not generate 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.199
 what is the purple grass of colors 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.719
 crazy what purple is like 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.640
 generated one is not going to happen anymore 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.180
 also new ones that it brings is that the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.000
 the modes now have the health of pc it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.129
 they increased both good and bad and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 in pc health also do what 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.289
 is the use of ram that apparently good 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.240
 I did not hear you a lot of ram but you 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.729
 well maybe if you have to do with the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.429
 ram I noticed that I created the recorder this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.800
 that I think it has to be com why this 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.170
 and good as I tell you right now I had to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.550
 cut from the intro to here because I do not know 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 yes it is passion but I did not want 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.289
 risk when I'm recording and it happened 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 in the previous version when I was 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.399
 recording the past of the intro of picada 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.890
 play to play entry to any 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.259
 map was created the video no longer served their 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.569
 to be able to reproduce and good all the video 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.860
 everything was going to the trash it happened to me several 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.800
 times and I think it 's annoying 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.400
 and good a marathon 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.140
 but this is the map that I made for the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.659
 review of ultra mainer does not know what 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.310
 a village but well this I say no 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.829
 they are not many news in terms of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.299
 something visible in itself is not very visible 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.939
 the changes I tell them the changes were 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 more than anything internal in terms of 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.040
 performance the generation branch of worlds 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.590
 as well 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.090
 this matter was reported that is not 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.130
 can generate infinite worlds in 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.870
 devices with a core was deactivated 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.100
 the button went gray and good for 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 activate it they just have to go to 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.820
 options in my case I do not know if I have 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.820
 those options 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.740
 let's see when it is assumed that when 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.450
 the main menu goes down 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.950
 experimental says enable worlds 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.680
 infinite in this case does not appear the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.660
 button but at the end that it appeared they have 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 a core or something like that also notice that the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.640
 view distance limited me to 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.800
 three stripes nothing else I do not know why and 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 good 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.070
 so that those who are in the trial of 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.990
 nuclei and you can have infinities 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.540
 nothing more active in the switch that is 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.490
 well below it 's down experimental 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.320
 here in my case it is not because I do not have 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.450
 a core and good can not be displayed in 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.220
 the ipod because nobody is still not 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.680
 it still does not get to follow in laser 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.530
 point 9.0 in birds 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.230
 and good also to inform them what 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.110
 what about the skins that talk the 15 do not go 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.810
 to do all 15 apparently if it goes 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.300
 to leave the 0.9 and something or maybe in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.680
 the one that I keep just like that more than anything 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.580
 concentrate on ships that are very 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.739
 Serious the truth this and good the grass 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.120
 is more I believe that you the village if a 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.370
 equivocal this is the village where is the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.720
 purple grass I do not think it calls chords and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.720
 I think here saying where said 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.130
 do the review and does not distinguish it because 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.600
 everything is normal here everything was 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.489
 purple the day I brought them in the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.530
 review of grass colors and how 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.850
 you can see no more colors for 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.340
 behind and some to me the truth yes I 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.980
 liked to climb interesting in certain in 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.600
 certain places the southern grass and in purple 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.269
 very much and the green moat but 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 well they fixed it also what 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.390
 analyze change in enrollment on 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.269
 Aztec can obviously be that even in 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.489
 the facebook page for 2.3 I think that 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.489
 and several sub solutions in the wall of 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.750
 the page to always check me 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.540
 help in that thank you very much because 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 well I do not have 2.3 then many 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.340
 thank you and for this it is now that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.520
 I already have the same time 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.750
 I went back to see them I will bring what they are 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.459
 the pipes are going to 0.92 but what is not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.310
 it comes out as I tell you the changes of the 0.9 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.380
 point 2 they will put them to 0.9 point 1 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.870
 in aib it is so nobody will see the 0.9 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.699
 point 1 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.979
 and bring these news because it is no longer 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.530
 will bring the severe bucs that brought the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.030
 time a very bad version the 0.9 point 13 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 of all these ships with the the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.810
 performance but also the even 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.699
 to the former rights administrator and today 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.220
 I feel that there are jerks and the 170 egezy and 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.919
 how is lailac still brings many 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.979
 ships with what is the creative you get 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.580
 to mop if night happens also in mode 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.419
 Peacefully mobs come out of the grass and 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.010
 phrasing memory reminders in the chat 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.900
 many things that already good that are already 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.030
 solved wait and do not do more 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.350
 so anything weird they notice 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.729
 please have it in my case 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.039
 really nothing of what there was 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.510
 previously and well, nothing I think is 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.190
 all for this video I hope you enjoy it 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.710
 the truth I feel that it goes more fluid I do not 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.270
 like it a lot and like he said a tip 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.820
 for homework I will be doing the reviews 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.370
 and the performance test in both there 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.900
 posts the 4 in the 5 that are of those that 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.880
 I have and therefore nobody or everything 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.039
 this video not in the next one because it has 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.810
 liked in mind when writing and not 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.180
 forget that all the musicians needed 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.010
 that they occupy will be on the page of 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.870
 facebook working then here to blood no 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.680
 you can not and the one that you in the next 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.740
 video 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.410
 and vice 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.410
