this series all right hang on I'm going
to<00:01:51.390> switch<00:01:51.630> into<00:01:51.750> super<00:01:52.200> fast<00:01:52.470> speed<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to switch into super fast speed and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
to switch into super fast speed and
build<00:01:54.270> us<00:01:54.450> alien<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.829> chromastone

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
build us alien kind of the chromastone

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.300 
build us alien kind of the chromastone
alien<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.710> people<00:01:58.950> don't

believe that I have the superpower of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.420 
believe that I have the superpower of
speed<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.840> prove<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.259> while<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> build

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
speed so just to prove it while I build

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
speed so just to prove it while I build
chromastone<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> talk<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> at

let<00:02:36.480> me<00:02:36.540> fix<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.900> turn<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> Sun<00:02:38.190> round

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
let me fix that turn the Sun round

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
let me fix that turn the Sun round
because<00:02:38.700> sometimes<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> super<00:02:40.350> fast

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
because sometimes I go a super fast

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.390 
because sometimes I go a super fast
speed<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.130> fast<00:02:41.900> then<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.930> don't<00:02:43.319> see<00:02:44.160> we're<00:02:44.310> not

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
speed so fast then I don't see we're not

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690 
speed so fast then I don't see we're not
going<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:44.760> okay<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.280> excellent

notice he's got his little gross
his<00:02:52.769> crystals<00:02:53.190> growing<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.549> his<00:02:53.700> chest<00:02:54.030> at

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
his crystals growing out of his chest at

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.170 
his crystals growing out of his chest at
his<00:02:54.299> head<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.470> back<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.920> his<00:02:56.069> head<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.640> his

back that's pretty cool and I got one

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.750 
back that's pretty cool and I got one
extra<00:02:59.810> crystal<00:03:00.810> KC<00:03:01.769> lose<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.400> guess<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
extra crystal KC lose it I guess it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.220 
extra crystal KC lose it I guess it
takes<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> lose<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.810> extra<00:03:03.930> you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
takes you lose one you get one extra you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.610 
takes you lose one you get one extra you
can<00:03:04.380> put<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> somewhere<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:06.000> crystal

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
can put it somewhere and it's crystal

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.830 
can put it somewhere and it's crystal
like<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> others<00:03:07.980> he's<00:03:08.190> very<00:03:08.459> flexible<00:03:09.150> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
like the others he's very flexible and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.380 
like the others he's very flexible and
super<00:03:10.049> foldable<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.950> what<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.549> big<00:03:11.790> feet<00:03:12.150> you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
super foldable and what is big feet you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.530 
super foldable and what is big feet you
can<00:03:12.959> stand<00:03:13.200> up<00:03:13.380> pretty<00:03:13.590> easy<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.359> we

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
can stand up pretty easy and you know we

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.660 
can stand up pretty easy and you know we
put<00:03:15.810> about<00:03:15.959> one<00:03:16.140> leg<00:03:16.320> I'm<00:03:16.560> sure<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:17.430> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
put about one leg I'm sure like that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
put about one leg I'm sure like that
just<00:03:18.090> balance<00:03:18.450> him<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.959> he<00:03:19.140> holds<00:03:19.320> this

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
just balance him and he holds this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.300 
just balance him and he holds this
position<00:03:20.150> rather<00:03:21.150> well<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.739> we'll<00:03:22.950> take<00:03:23.160> some

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
position rather well and we'll take some

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.580 
position rather well and we'll take some
still<00:03:23.579> photos<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:24.030> show<00:03:24.650> some<00:03:25.650> folks<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.130> there

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
still photos to show some folks is there

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.810 
still photos to show some folks is there
let's<00:03:28.590> chromastone<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.220> can't<00:03:29.459> wait<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> start

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
let's chromastone I can't wait to start

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.190 
let's chromastone I can't wait to start
doing<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:31.609> start<00:03:32.609> doing<00:03:32.940> left<00:03:33.200> the
