that<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.749> goes<00:01:49.840> around<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.139> edge<00:01:50.319> which<00:01:50.950> is

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
that it goes around the edge which is

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.449 
that it goes around the edge which is
really<00:01:51.189> good<00:01:51.340> it's<00:01:51.789> also<00:01:51.939> got<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:53.459> shock

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
really good it's also got a shock

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
absorbent keel protector on the back it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.209 
absorbent keel protector on the back it
does<00:01:57.249> have<00:01:57.490> some<00:01:57.990> padding<00:01:58.990> through<00:01:59.319> the<00:01:59.529> chin

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
does have some padding through the chin

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.330 
does have some padding through the chin
and<00:02:00.249> the<00:02:00.789> carp<00:02:01.209> and<00:02:01.479> obviously<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.469> heel<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and the carp and obviously the heel and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.239 
and the carp and obviously the heel and
a<00:02:03.700> aluminium<00:02:04.539> toast<00:02:05.469> later<00:02:05.679> they<00:02:05.920> didn't<00:02:06.100> say

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
a aluminium toast later they didn't say

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.410 
a aluminium toast later they didn't say
its<00:02:06.369> aluminium<00:02:06.549> but<00:02:06.939> I'm<00:02:07.029> guessing<00:02:07.179> it's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
its aluminium but I'm guessing it's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.780 
its aluminium but I'm guessing it's
going<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.600> be

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
going to be

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.749 
going to be
I<00:02:07.820> mean<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:09.229> rest<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.560> birds<00:02:09.770> made<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.220> 1.3

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
I mean the rest of the birds made it 1.3

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.150 
I mean the rest of the birds made it 1.3
mil<00:02:10.970> leather<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:12.230> does<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.560> quite<00:02:12.950> good

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
mil leather it does have quite good

ventilation<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.870> boots<00:02:15.110> internally<00:02:16.040> is

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
ventilation the boots internally is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.650 
ventilation the boots internally is
quite<00:02:16.610> padded<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.030> actually<00:02:17.120> found<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.510> more

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
quite padded I actually found it more

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
quite padded I actually found it more
comfortable<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.140> wear<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.680> then<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.460> did<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
comfortable to wear this then I did the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.600 
comfortable to wear this then I did the
cities<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.750> not<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.530> much<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.010> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
cities which is not so much but this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.580 
cities which is not so much but this
felt<00:02:22.910> bit<00:02:23.120> more<00:02:23.300> padded<00:02:23.660> internally<00:02:24.290> than<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
felt bit more padded internally than the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.800 
felt bit more padded internally than the
city's<00:02:24.860> did<00:02:25.420> could<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.480> completely<00:02:26.630> wrong

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
city's did could be completely wrong

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.250 
city's did could be completely wrong
there<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:27.440> also<00:02:27.950> came<00:02:28.310> out<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.580> me<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
there but that's also came out to me the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.720 
there but that's also came out to me the
way<00:02:30.350> these<00:02:30.470> boots<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:30.950> set<00:02:31.310> up<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
way these boots are set up is that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.000 
way these boots are set up is that
there's<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.000> zip<00:02:32.210> that's<00:02:32.630> from<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.320> base<00:02:33.680> to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there's a zip that's from the base to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.920 
there's a zip that's from the base to
the<00:02:34.040> top<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:35.450> behind<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.690> see

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
the top it's behind this you can see

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.750 
the top it's behind this you can see
hopefully<00:02:39.500> because<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.400> goes<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
hopefully because if that goes all the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.130 
hopefully because if that goes all the
way<00:02:40.850> up<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.240> that's<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.350> goes<00:02:42.500> i<00:02:42.620> first<00:02:43.090> onto<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
way up so that's it goes i first onto a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.210 
way up so that's it goes i first onto a
velcro<00:02:45.140> pad<00:02:46.010> there<00:02:46.490> put<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.630> down<00:02:48.040> pop<00:02:49.040> that

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
velcro pad there put that down pop that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.490 
velcro pad there put that down pop that
over<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.459> top<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.890> your<00:02:52.100> toes<00:02:52.820> click<00:02:53.540> down

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.750 

tighten<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.620> push<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:59.170> turn<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.350> up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
tighten that up push this in turn it up

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.030 
tighten that up push this in turn it up
good<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> go<00:03:01.970> again<00:03:02.930> very<00:03:03.560> easy<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:03.920> off

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
good to go again very easy to get off

boob<00:03:15.010> right<00:03:16.010> outside<00:03:16.130> bit<00:03:16.459> obviously<00:03:16.760> it's

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
boob right outside bit obviously it's

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.880 
boob right outside bit obviously it's
completely<00:03:17.330> identical<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:17.989> from<00:03:18.590> what<00:03:18.709> i<00:03:18.769> can

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
completely identical but from what i can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.860 
completely identical but from what i can
tell<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.700> one<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.000> made<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.450> factory<00:03:20.720> by

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
tell this one was made in the factory by

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.180 
tell this one was made in the factory by
somebody<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.260> actually<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.830> their<00:03:22.010> job

somebody that actually like their job
this<00:03:22.580> was<00:03:22.820> done<00:03:23.060> by<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.269> token<00:03:23.959> emo<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
this was done by the token emo of the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.580 
this was done by the token emo of the
whole<00:03:24.920> workspace<00:03:26.290> problems<00:03:27.290> I've<00:03:27.380> had<00:03:27.410> with

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
whole workspace problems I've had with

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.970 
whole workspace problems I've had with
this<00:03:27.709> one<00:03:27.950> are<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:29.390> zipper<00:03:30.110> on<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.530> inside<00:03:30.680> of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
this one are the zipper on the inside of

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.900 
this one are the zipper on the inside of
this<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.720> bit<00:03:32.720> flaky<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.680> reckoned<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.130> there's

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
this is bit flaky I reckoned it there's

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.400 
this is bit flaky I reckoned it there's
a<00:03:34.970> pretty<00:03:35.330> good<00:03:35.390> chance<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:35.989> zip<00:03:36.290> is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
a pretty good chance that that zip is

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.110 
a pretty good chance that that zip is
going<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.620> give<00:03:36.739> away<00:03:36.830> next<00:03:37.220> couple<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.000> months

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
going to give away next couple of months

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.350 
going to give away next couple of months

the<00:03:42.620> heel<00:03:42.950> slider<00:03:43.250> there's<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.760> couple<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:45.190> hex

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
the heel slider there's a couple of hex

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.320 
the heel slider there's a couple of hex
bolts<00:03:46.610> they're<00:03:46.760> going<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.090> sides<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:48.380> the

what I've done is put some some glue on
it<00:04:09.030> camry<00:04:09.569> well<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.780> was<00:04:10.040> like<00:04:11.040> an<00:04:11.129> epoxy<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.670> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it camry well it was like an epoxy on it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.729 
it camry well it was like an epoxy on it
to<00:04:12.510> stick<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.080> down<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.349> hill<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.530> that

to stick it down to the hill and that

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.080 
to stick it down to the hill and that
seems<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.190> kept<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.700> place<00:04:14.879> for<00:04:15.060> the

seems to have kept it in place for the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.479 
seems to have kept it in place for the
last<00:04:15.269> couple<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.540> weeks<00:04:15.690> which<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.049> good<00:04:16.489> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
last couple of weeks which is good the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.469 
last couple of weeks which is good the
other<00:04:17.639> problem<00:04:17.760> I've<00:04:17.970> had<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.359> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
other problem I've had with it is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.199 
other problem I've had with it is
internally<00:04:19.019> there's<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.500> bolt<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.820> bolt<00:04:21.120> here

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
internally there's a bolt this bolt here

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.780 
internally there's a bolt this bolt here
which<00:04:22.079> goes<00:04:22.320> through<00:04:22.350> into<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> inside<00:04:23.729> of

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
which goes through into the inside of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.310 
which goes through into the inside of
the<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:25.260> lining<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:25.919> just<00:04:26.610> above<00:04:26.790> my<00:04:27.030> ankle

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
the the lining so just above my ankle

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.770 
the the lining so just above my ankle
there's<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.470> point<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.880> bolt<00:04:30.210> digs<00:04:30.570> into

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
there's a point that the bolt digs into

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.590 
there's a point that the bolt digs into
and<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.020> wore<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.320> for<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:32.010> week<00:04:32.820> before<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
and I wore this for a week before the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.939 
and I wore this for a week before the
thinking<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.139> birds<00:04:34.410> need<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.740> worn

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
thinking that the birds need to be worn

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.760 
thinking that the birds need to be worn
in<00:04:35.070> for<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.850> would<00:04:35.970> get<00:04:36.090> better<00:04:36.210> not<00:04:36.990> made<00:04:37.650> it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
in for it would get better not made it

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.730 
in for it would get better not made it
worse<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.960> actually<00:04:39.960> really<00:04:40.410> made<00:04:40.590> me<00:04:40.710> want

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
worse and actually really made me want

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.260 
worse and actually really made me want
to<00:04:40.919> throw<00:04:40.979> these<00:04:41.220> boots<00:04:41.490> off<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.699> cliff<00:04:41.910> which<00:04:42.180> I

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
to throw these boots off a cliff which I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.080 
to throw these boots off a cliff which I
had<00:04:42.800> before<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:43.979> ask<00:04:44.160> yes<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.639> did<00:04:44.789> go<00:04:44.880> back<00:04:45.000> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
had before you ask yes I did go back to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.460 
had before you ask yes I did go back to
the<00:04:45.150> dealership<00:04:45.360> these<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.199> actually<00:04:46.410> an

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
the dealership these are actually an

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.610 
the dealership these are actually an
end-of-line<00:04:47.060> boot<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.750> manufacturer

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
end-of-line boot so the manufacturer

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.870 
end-of-line boot so the manufacturer
probably<00:04:50.130> wouldn't<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:50.460> been<00:04:50.490> able<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.820> do

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
probably wouldn't have been able to do

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.490 
probably wouldn't have been able to do
anything<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.150> this<00:04:51.330> line<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.690> boot<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.050> I

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
anything with this line of boot and I

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.760 
anything with this line of boot and I
probably<00:04:52.710> would<00:04:52.949> have<00:04:53.010> had<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.220> go<00:04:53.340> up<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.699> a

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
probably would have had to go up to a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.900 
probably would have had to go up to a
city<00:04:55.770> or<00:04:56.070> something<00:04:56.340> else<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.580> get<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.760> same

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
city or something else to get the same

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.060 
city or something else to get the same
sort<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.180> level<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.510> protection<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.139> in<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.889> way

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
sort of level of protection so in a way

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.189 
sort of level of protection so in a way
it's<00:04:59.370> kind<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.669> workaround<00:05:00.000> I'm<00:05:00.389> only<00:05:00.930> paid

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
it's kind of a workaround I'm only paid

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.770 
it's kind of a workaround I'm only paid
250<00:05:01.770> dollars<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:02.430> Australian<00:05:03.300> two

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
250 dollars for these Australian two

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.909 
250 dollars for these Australian two
hundred<00:05:04.080> fifty<00:05:04.139> dollars<00:05:04.440> Australian<00:05:04.830> for

hundred fifty dollars Australian for

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.490 
hundred fifty dollars Australian for
these<00:05:05.039> so<00:05:05.910> I'm<00:05:06.000> not<00:05:06.090> too<00:05:06.300> disappointed<00:05:07.289> in<00:05:07.380> it

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
these so I'm not too disappointed in it

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.440 
these so I'm not too disappointed in it
but<00:05:07.710> at<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.010> same<00:05:08.190> time<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.520> am<00:05:08.669> because<00:05:09.330> I'm

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
but at the same time I am because I'm

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.710 
but at the same time I am because I'm
having<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.780> wear<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.260> piece<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.470> foam<00:05:11.660> next<00:05:12.660> to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
having to wear a piece of foam next to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.860 
having to wear a piece of foam next to
my<00:05:12.840> ankle<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.139> stop<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:13.560> bolt<00:05:13.800> from<00:05:13.950> begin<00:05:14.280> so

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
my ankle to stop that bolt from begin so

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.180 
my ankle to stop that bolt from begin so
yeah<00:05:15.870> bit<00:05:16.410> fiddly<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.800> that's<00:05:17.010> sort<00:05:17.160> of

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
yeah bit fiddly and that's sort of

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.460 
yeah bit fiddly and that's sort of
respect<00:05:17.490> but<00:05:17.849> what<00:05:18.479> I<00:05:18.510> recommend<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.080> yes<00:05:19.470> I

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
would probably run down and see if

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.310 
would probably run down and see if
they've<00:05:24.180> got<00:05:24.270> any<00:05:24.330> more<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.690> these<00:05:24.840> left<00:05:25.080> out
