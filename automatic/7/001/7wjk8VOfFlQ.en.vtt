00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
and working my way up with a wide tooth

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
and working my way up with a wide tooth
comb<00:02:00.779> my<00:02:01.779> hair<00:02:01.809> is<00:02:02.169> pretty<00:02:02.380> much<00:02:02.639> detangled

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
comb my hair is pretty much detangled

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.849 
comb my hair is pretty much detangled
because<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.719> do<00:02:04.779> it<00:02:04.959> in<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.109> shower<00:02:05.139> sometimes

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
because I do it in the shower sometimes

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.820 
because I do it in the shower sometimes
but<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.969> also<00:02:07.329> use<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.659> smaller<00:02:08.050> comb<00:02:08.319> just<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
but I also use a smaller comb just to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.669 
but I also use a smaller comb just to
make<00:02:09.039> sure<00:02:09.069> all<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.459> kinks<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.030> everything

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
make sure all the kinks and everything

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
make sure all the kinks and everything
out<00:02:11.150> especially<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.209> my<00:02:12.359> ends<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.079> want

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

only<00:02:13.640> seen<00:02:14.640> her<00:02:14.730> strand<00:02:15.000> knots<00:02:15.120> coming<00:02:15.569> up<00:02:15.719> in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
only seen her strand knots coming up in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.619 
only seen her strand knots coming up in
the<00:02:16.500> future<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.879> make<00:02:18.060> sure<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.209> hair<00:02:18.540> is

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
the future so I make sure my hair is

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.420 
the future so I make sure my hair is
detangled<00:02:19.230> before<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:19.859> washing<00:02:20.129> goes
