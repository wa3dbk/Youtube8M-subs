 the same news analogs of the drug bi-58 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 principle with a very similar action 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.150
 many why I would not like with you

 you do not feel you after feel 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.720
 here is the authenticity itself directly 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.710
 drug can check 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.250
 directly processing some of 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.810
 shrub plants and the result 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.900
 instant actually if the plant was 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.880
 infected and the flame through there is an hour 23 already 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.770
 see the result that there are ticks or 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.250
 are there any similar pests ? 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:40.620
 plants die too 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.220

 same actually divorced 1 bye 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 What do I personally like about this drug? 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.910
 for such small packaging 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.220
 volumes of what I bought to process 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010
 culture needs at least a couple of times per season 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
 payouts ie packing as i said 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.820
 2am cookies drug he divorced you 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.910
 will not stand if you need to use 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.830
 immediately before use preferably 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.130
 in such a way to shake the drug 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.030
 seeing him a little bit darker 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.600
 stops from this produced by 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.480
 the norm 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.000
 one shelf must be divorced time 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.180
 which liter of water can be given a little 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.790
 less there are 43 disputed liters 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:34.730
 water volume and thus process 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.730
 the plant after which it will actually be 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.370
 visible result is desirable to handle 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.370
 at 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.639
 principle as i usually use after 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:52.430
 lunch there they drove themselves before lunch to 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.340
 the temperature was no more than twenty five 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.560
 degrees or ratima so that there is no 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.939
 the most 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.049
 plant race or prominent sources that 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:09.370
 lucky because maybe they are the one 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:15.889
 the result is naturally desirable 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:18.259
 rubber glove raspirator than 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.199
 actually going on i scour 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.240
 somehow ordinary if it's some kind 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.380
 houseplant him a big bush 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.360
 currants and gooseberries and vishnu de gasset 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.900
 and that is, I have a small 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 which dissector
