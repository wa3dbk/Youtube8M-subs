 step-by-step surgical technique 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.869
 the anatomical limits of the other regions have always represented 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.259
 a challenge for the surgeon 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.539
 poor bone quality and the presence of the maxillary sinus 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.680
 I had limited the possibilities of placing the plant in this area 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.399
 moreover the degree of atrophy of the alveolar ridges often prevents the use 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.050
 clinical of short implants 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.880
 or angled implants that reduce invasiveness of the intervention 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.860
 surgical 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.190
 in these clinical cases the use of sinus surgery is the only one 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.440
 viable therapeutic solution 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.290
 which allows the patient to have the comfort of a fixed prosthesis 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.750
 over the years the codification standardization of the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.079

 unit the evolution of biomaterials of plantar surfaces 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.690
 allowed to achieve implant survival rates in cases of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.340
 maxillary sinus elevation comparable to survival 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.980
 ossola tv implant 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.420
 the literature data is our clinical experience 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.090
 allow us to state that maxillary sinus surgery is one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330
 predictable surgical technique 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 with excellent clinical results in terms of survival in remote arch support 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 the following chapters are covered in the video 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 surgical anatomy and 3d radiological investigations 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 the paranasal sinuses have happened neuma ticket of the facial massif 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.780
 covered with a respiratory mucosa composed of an epithelium 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.899
 multi-layered ciliate 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.550
 on which it flows unique 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.720
 secreted by the muciparous cells 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.190
 the mucus is divided into a single fraction in which the eyelashes are contained 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.040
 vibratulars that allow the movement of the most superficial fraction 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 diagnostic phase 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.889
 a very important parameter to evaluate when designing a 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.510
 maxillary sinus augmentation intervention and the degree of resorption meters 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.239
 of the alveolar ridge space 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.319
 this variable must be evaluated both in a coronal peak direction 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.540
 by measuring the amount of bone available at the ridge level 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.439

 during the execution of a sinus lift 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.349
 it is necessary for the surgeon to use adequate equipment 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.949
 and that it was assisted by an effective and efficient surgical team 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.479
 our school has designed two different roar circles for elevation 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.249
 of the maxillary sinus 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.500
 with a view to minimally invasive surgery 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.010
 it is our pinion that an antrostomy

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.249
 in the piezoelectric technique the sinus lift operation can 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.649
 be divided into two distinct phases 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.329

 laposte cmyk is a large-scale drilling management technique 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.869
 which allows to continue the maxillary sinus elevation without aborting

 surgery 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.189
 with respect to the traditional technique, changes have been made 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.109

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.300
 once in 1977 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.409
 it has been a remarkable evolution 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.669
