characters is gonna disappear forever
right<00:05:13.440> let's<00:05:13.890> just<00:05:13.950> say<00:05:14.190> that<00:05:14.370> if<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.640> fuse

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
right let's just say that if you fuse

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.870 
right let's just say that if you fuse
venom<00:05:15.750> into<00:05:15.960> spider-man<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:17.220> get<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> black

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
venom into spider-man you get a black

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.570 
venom into spider-man you get a black
spider-man<00:05:18.390> if<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:20.010> has<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.370> same

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
spider-man if you and it has the same

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.030 
spider-man if you and it has the same
moves<00:05:20.880> now<00:05:21.180> if<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.450> fuse<00:05:21.830> spider-man<00:05:22.830> into

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
moves now if you fuse spider-man into

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.800 
moves now if you fuse spider-man into
venom<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:25.260> know<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.860> get<00:05:26.040> a<00:05:26.210> let's<00:05:27.210> say<00:05:27.390> a<00:05:27.419> red

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
venom you know you get a let's say a red

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.700 
venom you know you get a let's say a red
and<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.680> guess<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.850> red<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.210> blue<00:05:30.450> venom<00:05:31.229> let's

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710

moves I mean most people would probably

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.330 
moves I mean most people would probably
fuse<00:05:36.060> venom<00:05:36.540> into<00:05:36.690> spider-man<00:05:37.080> because<00:05:37.830> his
