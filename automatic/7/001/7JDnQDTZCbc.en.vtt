00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
yo Elliott I've been working out for two

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.510 
yo Elliott I've been working out for two
months<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:17.130> getting<00:00:17.310> pretty<00:00:17.369> good

months and I'm getting pretty good

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.210 
months and I'm getting pretty good
results<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> left<00:00:18.869> side<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.439> my<00:00:19.560> back<00:00:19.890> my

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
results but the left side of my back my

lats and my lumbar erectors on that left

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.140 
lats and my lumbar erectors on that left
side<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.580> growing<00:00:24.560> differently<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.710> bigger

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
side is growing differently it's bigger

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
side is growing differently it's bigger
than<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> other<00:00:27.449> side<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.750> growing<00:00:28.109> uneven

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
than the other side I'm growing uneven

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.669 
than the other side I'm growing uneven
please<00:00:29.640> help<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.900> should<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> do

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
please help me what should I do

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
please help me what should I do
so<00:00:32.340> Lalo<00:00:32.880> here's<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.170> watch

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
so Lalo here's the thing if you watch

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.250 
so Lalo here's the thing if you watch
none<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.710> earlier<00:00:35.010> videos<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.110> put

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
none of my earlier videos I think I put

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440 
none of my earlier videos I think I put
one<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.469> maybe<00:00:37.649> two<00:00:37.860> months<00:00:37.980> ago<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one up maybe two months ago about the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.650 
one up maybe two months ago about the
nervous<00:00:39.780> system<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.370> how<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> muscles<00:00:42.210> will

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
nervous system and how the muscles will

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.869 
nervous system and how the muscles will
function<00:00:43.410> based<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.100> how<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> nervous<00:00:44.730> system

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
function based on how the nervous system

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.819 
function based on how the nervous system
speaks<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> muscle<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.559> does<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
speaks to the muscle right does that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.139 
speaks to the muscle right does that
make<00:00:46.980> sense<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.850> central<00:00:48.120> nervous

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
make sense so your central nervous

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.580 
make sense so your central nervous
system<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:48.960> peripheral<00:00:49.379> nervous

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
system and then your peripheral nervous

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
system and then your peripheral nervous
system<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.399> central<00:00:50.789> nervous<00:00:50.910> system<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
system the central nervous system the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
system the central nervous system the
Central<00:00:51.809> Command<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.309> generate

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
Central Command is where you generate

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
Central Command is where you generate
that<00:00:54.210> energy<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.260> lift<00:00:55.469> weight

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that energy so that you can lift weight

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.470 
that energy so that you can lift weight
right<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> generate<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> certain<00:00:57.360> amount

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
right so you generate a certain amount

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
right so you generate a certain amount
of<00:00:57.600> force<00:00:57.809> through<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.289> central<00:00:58.620> nervous

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of force through your central nervous

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
of force through your central nervous
system<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.520> goes<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> muscles<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
system and it goes out to the muscles so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.290 
system and it goes out to the muscles so
I<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.020> muscles<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.739> two<00:01:01.829> arms

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
I got two muscles right I got two arms

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
I got two muscles right I got two arms
the<00:01:03.300> brain<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:04.290> split<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.710> halves<00:01:04.949> right<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the brain is split into halves right it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
the brain is split into halves right it
kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> crosses<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.409> information

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
kind of crosses and then the information

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
kind of crosses and then the information
goes<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.180> these<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.479> sides<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> body

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
goes out to these two sides of the body

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.219 
goes out to these two sides of the body
boom<00:01:10.560> boom<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.659> generate<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
boom boom right so I can generate the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.490 
boom boom right so I can generate the
same<00:01:13.500> amount<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.010> strength<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.700> both<00:01:14.729> sides

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
same amount of strength on both sides

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.670 
same amount of strength on both sides
right<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.680> body<00:01:16.770> splitting<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:18.320> say<00:01:19.320> there's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
right your body splitting to say there's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
right your body splitting to say there's
a<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> nervous<00:01:21.420> impulse<00:01:21.780> coming

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
a if there's a nervous impulse coming

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
a if there's a nervous impulse coming
out<00:01:22.259> there's<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> 50/50<00:01:23.430> split<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> nervous

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
out there's a 50/50 split so the nervous

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
out there's a 50/50 split so the nervous
impulse<00:01:24.840> pulse<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> there's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> 50-50<00:01:26.340> split

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
impulse pulse and there's a 50-50 split

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.910 
impulse pulse and there's a 50-50 split
50%<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> energy<00:01:27.540> 50%<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> energy<00:01:28.740> right

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
50% of energy 50% of the energy right

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.550 
50% of energy 50% of the energy right
boom<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.790> double<00:01:30.540> bicep<00:01:30.960> both<00:01:31.229> arms<00:01:31.500> are

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
boom good double bicep both arms are

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.469 
boom good double bicep both arms are
growing<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.890> same<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:33.590> there<00:01:34.590> are

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
growing at the same time but there are

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.399 
growing at the same time but there are
imbalances<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> particular

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
imbalances you can have a particular

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.520 
imbalances you can have a particular
imbalance<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.460> skeletal<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
imbalance right it's actually skeletal a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.069 
imbalance right it's actually skeletal a
skeletal<00:01:43.530> imbalance<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.540> vertebrae

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
skeletal imbalance in your vertebrae

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.039 
skeletal imbalance in your vertebrae
that<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:47.009> cause<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that will cause it will be out of the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.480 
that will cause it will be out of the
line<00:01:49.200> means<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.500> such<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.130> perhaps<00:01:51.200> 60

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
line means in such a way that perhaps 60

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
line means in such a way that perhaps 60
40<00:01:53.490> percent<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> energy<00:01:54.810> goes<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.110> right

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
40 percent of the energy goes out right

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
40 percent of the energy goes out right
so<00:01:55.439> there's<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.680> imbalance<00:01:55.890> where<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> 50/50

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so there's an imbalance where a 50/50

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.340 
so there's an imbalance where a 50/50
split<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.509> normal<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.290> only

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
split would be normal but you're only

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
split would be normal but you're only
you're<00:01:58.530> getting<00:01:58.590> 60%<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> energy<00:01:59.759> here

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you're getting 60% of the energy here

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.220 
you're getting 60% of the energy here
and<00:02:00.149> only<00:02:00.570> 40%<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> energy<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
and only 40% of the energy there and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.810 
and only 40% of the energy there and
happen<00:02:02.620> is<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:03.130> arms<00:02:03.460> going<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.670> grow

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
happen is this arms going to grow

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.130 
happen is this arms going to grow
stronger<00:02:04.150> because<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.540> generate<00:02:04.930> more<00:02:05.080> force

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
stronger because you generate more force

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.680 
stronger because you generate more force
or<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.490> low<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.120> generate

more<00:02:07.810> force<00:02:07.870> on<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.350> side<00:02:08.590> than<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.220> other<00:02:09.250> so

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
more force on one side than the other so

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
more force on one side than the other so
you've<00:02:09.910> got<00:02:10.000> uneven<00:02:10.180> strength<00:02:11.110> or<00:02:11.350> even

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you've got uneven strength or even

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.910 
you've got uneven strength or even
