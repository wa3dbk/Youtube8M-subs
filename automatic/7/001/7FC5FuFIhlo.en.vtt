nut love that a lot of people try to

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.629 
nut love that a lot of people try to
figure<00:00:12.910> out<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.510> I<00:00:13.780> see<00:00:14.469> it<00:00:14.590> on<00:00:14.680> YouTube<00:00:15.100> but<00:00:15.400> I

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
figure out and I see it on YouTube but I

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.420 
figure out and I see it on YouTube but I
guess<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.660> correct<00:00:17.020> way<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.199> do<00:00:17.530> it<00:00:17.680> is<00:00:17.890> it's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
guess the correct way to do it is it's

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.060 
guess the correct way to do it is it's
tuned<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.789> an<00:00:18.880> open<00:00:19.180> e

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.440 
tuned to an open e
an<00:00:21.310> email<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:24.460> favorite<00:00:24.820> instrument<00:00:25.240> is<00:00:25.420> a

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
an email and my favorite instrument is a

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.740 
an email and my favorite instrument is a
is<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.869> lap<00:00:26.170> steel<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.950> know<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.100> always<00:00:27.750> loved

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
is a lap steel you know I always loved

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.830 
is a lap steel you know I always loved
how<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.140> sound<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:30.100> so<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.119> was<00:00:31.360> trying<00:00:31.720> to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
how that sound and so I was trying to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.270 
how that sound and so I was trying to
figure<00:00:32.020> out<00:00:32.260> how<00:00:32.439> can<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.680> do<00:00:32.739> that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
figure out how can I do that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.620 
figure out how can I do that
because<00:00:33.760> I<00:00:33.790> don't<00:00:33.850> know<00:00:34.059> how<00:00:34.150> to<00:00:34.239> play<00:00:34.450> it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
because I don't know how to play it

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.560 
because I don't know how to play it
obviously<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.280> always<00:00:36.730> tried<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.030> figure<00:00:37.450> it

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
obviously so I always tried to figure it

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:58.160 
obviously so I always tried to figure it
out<00:00:37.720> and<00:00:39.030> goes<00:00:40.030> like<00:00:40.150> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.620 

you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.430 

so<00:01:07.140> real<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.650> real<00:01:07.920> slow<00:01:08.340> it's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
so real like real slow it's

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.650 
so real like real slow it's
I'm<00:01:11.010> bending<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.940> b-string<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.720> whole-step

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
I'm bending the b-string up a whole-step

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.950
