00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
but right now I'm just trying to figure

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
but right now I'm just trying to figure
out<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.780> guys<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> couple<00:01:34.530> long

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
out where these guys I got a couple long

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
out where these guys I got a couple long
shots<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.450> an

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shots now look at I'm just about at an

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
shots now look at I'm just about at an
ammo<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> where<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
ammo and this is where it got a little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
ammo and this is where it got a little
bit<00:01:38.250> kinky<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> knew<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.960> guy<00:01:40.290> was

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
bit kinky here I knew that that guy was

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.690 
bit kinky here I knew that that guy was
hitting<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> didn't<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> waste<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
hitting me I didn't want to waste that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810 
hitting me I didn't want to waste that
so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> try<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> try<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> choose<00:01:44.640> my

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so I kind of a try to try to choose my

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
so I kind of a try to try to choose my
battles<00:01:45.090> wisely<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
battles wisely if you will and the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
battles wisely if you will and the
downside<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> why<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> might<00:01:48.479> actually

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
downside this is why I might actually

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
downside this is why I might actually
change<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.710> scavenger<00:01:50.310> often<00:01:50.729> change<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> for

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
change I'm scavenger often change it for

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
change I'm scavenger often change it for
the<00:01:51.270> other<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.810> lets<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.439> full

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the other one that lets you have full

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030 
the other one that lets you have full
ammo<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> start<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.960> even<00:01:55.920> with

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
ammo to start is because with even with

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
ammo to start is because with even with
scavenger<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.759> i'm<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.060> near<00:01:57.299> an<00:01:57.450> enemy<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> i

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
scavenger if i'm not near an enemy and i

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
scavenger if i'm not near an enemy and i
shoot<00:01:58.469> him<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> scavenger

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
shoot him I don't have the scavenger

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
shoot him I don't have the scavenger
pack<00:02:00.030> also<00:02:00.270> sometimes<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> enemy<00:02:01.619> draw

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pack also sometimes the enemy draw

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
pack also sometimes the enemy draw
doesn't<00:02:02.310> drop<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> scavenger<00:02:02.969> pack<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
doesn't drop a scavenger pack at all so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.210 
doesn't drop a scavenger pack at all so
I<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.930> what

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
I don't know what

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.580 
I don't know what
with<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.580> so<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.150> just<00:02:05.300> called<00:02:05.510> in<00:02:05.630> my<00:02:05.810> helo<00:02:06.380> or

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
with that so I just called in my helo or

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.460 
with that so I just called in my helo or
my<00:02:07.220> hind<00:02:07.820> excuse<00:02:08.690> me<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> don't<00:02:09.110> even<00:02:09.290> know<00:02:09.410> what

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
my hind excuse me I don't even know what

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.470 
my hind excuse me I don't even know what
the<00:02:09.590> heck<00:02:09.710> it's<00:02:10.160> basically<00:02:10.550> at<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.910> copter<00:02:11.330> from

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the heck it's basically at a copter from

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.630 
the heck it's basically at a copter from
modern<00:02:11.870> warfare<00:02:12.020> 2<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:12.860> but<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.280> crack

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
modern warfare 2 but but on crack

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.940 
modern warfare 2 but but on crack
because<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.450> actually<00:02:14.600> drops<00:02:15.230> bombs<00:02:15.530> over<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
because it actually drops bombs over the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.590 
because it actually drops bombs over the
enemy<00:02:16.160> now<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.060> only<00:02:17.120> reason<00:02:17.390> why<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
enemy now I'm the only reason why I know

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.880 
enemy now I'm the only reason why I know
that<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.930> because<00:02:18.080> I've<00:02:18.200> been<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> victim<00:02:18.590> of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
that is because I've been a victim of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.280 
that is because I've been a victim of
that<00:02:19.040> many<00:02:19.550> many<00:02:19.760> times<00:02:19.850> but<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:21.080> then<00:02:21.170> after

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that many many times but but then after

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.840 
that many many times but but then after
this<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:21.770> there<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.040> kind<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.430> this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
this then there is kind of like this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.630 
this then there is kind of like this
version<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:24.470> chopper<00:02:24.860> gunner<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.550> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
version of a chopper gunner that you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.280 
version of a chopper gunner that you
guys<00:02:25.790> will<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.690> I'll<00:02:26.810> use<00:02:26.840> here<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
guys will see that I'll use here in a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.080 
guys will see that I'll use here in a
little<00:02:27.410> bit<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.800> then<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.430> big<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.970> so

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
little bit and then the big one so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.480 
little bit and then the big one so
here's<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.330> helo<00:02:29.540> pilot<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.140> basically

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
here's the helo pilot which is basically

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.730 
here's the helo pilot which is basically
the<00:02:31.490> chopper<00:02:31.820> gunner<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:33.110> now<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.500> got<00:02:33.680> to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
the chopper gunner and so now I got to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.230 
the chopper gunner and so now I got to
find<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.920> little<00:02:34.010> place<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> post<00:02:34.550> up<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> can

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
find a little place to post up so I can

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.910 
find a little place to post up so I can
call<00:02:35.390> them<00:02:35.420> my<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.720> think<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:36.709> thing<00:02:36.740> I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
call them my I think and one thing I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.410 
call them my I think and one thing I
probably<00:02:37.190> shouldn't<00:02:37.760> be<00:02:37.820> doing<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.240> running

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
probably shouldn't be doing is running

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
probably shouldn't be doing is running
two<00:02:38.660> copters<00:02:38.990> in<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.350> row<00:02:39.500> because<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.280> just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
two copters in a row because it's just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.650 
two copters in a row because it's just
like<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> same<00:02:40.970> effect<00:02:41.240> from<00:02:41.330> modern<00:02:41.540> warfare

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
like the same effect from modern warfare

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.370 
like the same effect from modern warfare
2<00:02:41.930> when<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.230> callin<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:44.080> Harrier<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.230> then<00:02:45.320> you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
2 when you callin a Harrier and then you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.560 
2 when you callin a Harrier and then you
call<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:48.760> Harrier<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:49.940> attacked<00:02:50.270> our

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
call in a a Harrier that attacked our

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.860 
call in a a Harrier that attacked our
chopper<00:02:51.110> gunner<00:02:51.260> or<00:02:51.580> an<00:02:52.580> ac-130<00:02:53.180> when<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.720> did

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
chopper gunner or an ac-130 when you did

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.510 
chopper gunner or an ac-130 when you did
that<00:02:53.900> then<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.590> was<00:02:54.890> kind<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.220> pain<00:02:55.370> because

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
that then it was kind of a pain because

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.770 
that then it was kind of a pain because
they<00:02:55.700> would<00:02:55.820> just<00:02:55.850> decide<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> shoot<00:02:56.660> down

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
they would just decide to shoot down

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.630 
they would just decide to shoot down
your<00:02:56.930> support<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.530> not<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> wise<00:02:58.280> idea<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
your support so not a wise idea to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.920 
your support so not a wise idea to
probably<00:02:58.940> call<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.180> both<00:02:59.360> right<00:02:59.690> away<00:02:59.840> but

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
probably call in both right away but

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.500 
probably call in both right away but
this<00:03:00.230> thing<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.680> ridiculous<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:02.120> reminds

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
this thing is ridiculous this reminds

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.210 
this thing is ridiculous this reminds
you<00:03:02.600> definitely<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.530> chopper

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
you definitely have like the chopper

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.510 
you definitely have like the chopper
gunner<00:03:04.370> gunship<00:03:04.820> from<00:03:05.440> black<00:03:06.440> ops<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:06.950> i<00:03:07.190> do

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
gunner gunship from black ops but i do

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.699 
gunner gunship from black ops but i do
like<00:03:08.000> reversing<00:03:08.390> backwards<00:03:09.050> takes<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.590> little

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
like reversing backwards takes a little

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.140 
like reversing backwards takes a little
bit<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.920> time<00:03:10.070> which<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.310> realistic<00:03:10.880> i<00:03:10.970> mean

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
bit of time which is realistic i mean

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.120 
bit of time which is realistic i mean
when<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.390> kind<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.959> reverse<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.860> makes<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
when you kind of reverse it makes a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.550 
when you kind of reverse it makes a
little<00:03:13.250> more<00:03:13.430> difficult<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:15.200> can<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> just

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
little more difficult you can see I just

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.110 
little more difficult you can see I just
couldn't<00:03:15.950> kill<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.489> guy<00:03:16.700> right<00:03:16.820> here<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
couldn't kill this guy right here and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.000 
couldn't kill this guy right here and
then<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.269> try<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.480> back<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.380> think<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.890> try

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
then I try to back up and I think I try

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.979 
then I try to back up and I think I try
to<00:03:19.070> back<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:19.820> realize<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.720> me<00:03:20.810> but

um yeah right here I was stuck I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.699 
um yeah right here I was stuck I
couldn't<00:03:23.690> figure<00:03:23.780> out<00:03:23.900> why<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.140> wasn't<00:03:24.500> able<00:03:24.560> to

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.000 
couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to
move<00:03:24.830> back<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.310> just<00:03:25.489> decided<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.940> move<00:03:26.030> over

I've<00:04:20.840> found<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:22.100> first<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.120> all<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.960> think<00:04:24.260> it's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
I've found is first of all I think it's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.159 
I've found is first of all I think it's
hilarious<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:25.330> then<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.450> says<00:04:26.600> small<00:04:26.930> rod

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
hilarious that then it says small rod

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.830 
hilarious that then it says small rod
and<00:04:27.380> large<00:04:27.560> rod<00:04:27.800> also<00:04:28.310> oh<00:04:28.490> yeah<00:04:28.880> maybe<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.510> just

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
and large rod also oh yeah maybe I just

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.560 
and large rod also oh yeah maybe I just
noticed<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.229> my<00:04:30.380> um<00:04:30.590> my<00:04:31.040> my<00:04:31.850> dude<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.150> dead<00:04:32.330> my

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
noticed that my um my my dude is dead my

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.060 
noticed that my um my my dude is dead my
juggernauts<00:04:32.930> already<00:04:33.139> dead<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.710> could<00:04:33.950> be

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
juggernauts already dead it could be

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.230 
juggernauts already dead it could be
maybe<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.820> killed<00:04:35.000> him<00:04:35.090> myself

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
maybe it's because I killed him myself

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.590 
maybe it's because I killed him myself
there's<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.870> probably<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.200> possibility<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.860> that

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
there's a probably a possibility of that

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.659 
there's a probably a possibility of that
but<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:39.050> i<00:04:39.289> liked<00:04:39.740> head<00:04:39.919> of<00:04:40.010> said<00:04:40.160> small<00:04:40.460> rod

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
but but i liked head of said small rod

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.340 
but but i liked head of said small rod
because<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:41.479> have<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.660> small<00:04:41.930> rods<00:04:42.140> on<00:04:42.289> the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
because we have the small rods on the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.980 
because we have the small rods on the
left<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.919> larger<00:04:43.250> odd<00:04:43.430> fellows<00:04:44.180> on<00:04:44.570> the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
left and the larger odd fellows on the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.770 
left and the larger odd fellows on the
right<00:04:45.580> not<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:46.940> creates<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.479> blast

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
right not so it creates that blast

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.360 
right not so it creates that blast
radius<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.380> stuff<00:04:48.560> but<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.890> have<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.160> kind<00:04:49.280> of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
radius and stuff but you have to kind of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.400 
radius and stuff but you have to kind of
lead<00:04:49.580> with<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.970> little<00:04:50.090> bit<00:04:50.210> because<00:04:50.479> it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
lead with it a little bit because it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.680 
lead with it a little bit because it
strikes<00:04:51.800> within<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.310> certain<00:04:52.760> area<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.360> i

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
strikes within that certain area and i

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.300 
strikes within that certain area and i
don't<00:04:53.840> know<00:04:53.870> it's<00:04:54.229> kind<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.620> payment<00:04:54.979> this

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
don't know it's kind of a payment this

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.550 
don't know it's kind of a payment this
point<00:04:55.550> I'm<00:04:55.669> just<00:04:55.850> grabbing<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.539> mammal<00:04:57.350> in<00:04:57.530> a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
point I'm just grabbing a mammal in a

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.529 
point I'm just grabbing a mammal in a
separate<00:04:58.460> weapon<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.030> course<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.300> got<00:04:59.450> this

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
separate weapon and of course I got this

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.940 
separate weapon and of course I got this
little<00:04:59.750> rocket<00:05:00.110> I'm<00:05:00.380> actually<00:05:00.620> kind<00:05:00.890> of

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
little rocket I'm actually kind of

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.860 
little rocket I'm actually kind of
bummed<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.310> there's<00:05:01.460> no<00:05:01.610> javelin<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.570> this

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
bummed that there's no javelin in this

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.260 
bummed that there's no javelin in this
because<00:05:03.590> modern<00:05:03.800> warfare<00:05:04.039> was<00:05:04.400> obviously<00:05:05.000> jab

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
because modern warfare was obviously jab

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.570 
because modern warfare was obviously jab

the balance battle line instead of the

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.460 
the balance battle line instead of the
the<00:06:07.400> other<00:06:07.580> one<00:06:07.789> is<00:06:07.820> obviously<00:06:08.510> because<00:06:09.320> if

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
the other one is obviously because if

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.110 
the other one is obviously because if

the<00:06:13.370> other<00:06:13.520> one<00:06:13.700> is<00:06:13.849> a<00:06:14.240> slow<00:06:14.510> little<00:06:15.099> like<00:06:16.099> a

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
the other one is a slow little like a

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.760 
the other one is a slow little like a
helicopter<00:06:17.539> remote<00:06:18.140> control<00:06:18.440> thing<00:06:18.590> that

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
helicopter remote control thing that

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.860 
helicopter remote control thing that
shoots<00:06:18.950> rockets<00:06:19.010> and<00:06:19.550> it's<00:06:19.640> pretty<00:06:19.849> cool<00:06:20.030> it

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
shoots rockets and it's pretty cool it

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.300 
shoots rockets and it's pretty cool it
does<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.260> feels<00:06:21.470> like<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:21.710> get<00:06:21.830> probably<00:06:22.159> more

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
does it feels like you get probably more

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.730

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.140 
over and we still ended up losing him by
like<00:06:39.830> Cleveland<00:06:40.310> when<00:06:40.430> I<00:06:40.490> was<00:06:40.610> like<00:06:40.729> seriously

here again the small rod large rod and
the<00:06:46.729> blast<00:06:46.970> radius<00:06:47.090> right<00:06:47.539> here<00:06:47.750> it<00:06:48.140> says<00:06:48.200> it's

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
the blast radius right here it says it's

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.140 
the blast radius right here it says it's
recharging<00:06:49.099> and<00:06:49.250> right<00:06:49.610> there<00:06:49.789> I<00:06:49.820> thought<00:06:50.090> I

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
recharging and right there I thought I

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.430 
recharging and right there I thought I
would<00:06:50.270> have<00:06:50.390> killed<00:06:50.510> that<00:06:50.659> guy<00:06:50.810> didn't<00:06:51.110> happen

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
would have killed that guy didn't happen

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.409 
would have killed that guy didn't happen
I<00:06:51.620> hit<00:06:52.010> him<00:06:52.099> with<00:06:52.220> a<00:06:52.250> large<00:06:52.520> or<00:06:52.760> one<00:06:53.000> inning<00:06:53.120> and

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
I hit him with a large or one inning and

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.270 
I hit him with a large or one inning and
it<00:06:53.510> did<00:06:53.690> hit<00:06:53.870> so<00:06:54.110> ended<00:06:54.470> up<00:06:54.560> working<00:06:54.680> you<00:06:55.159> can

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
it did hit so ended up working you can

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.640 
it did hit so ended up working you can
also<00:06:55.430> move<00:06:55.669> the<00:06:55.729> juggernaut<00:06:56.300> to<00:06:56.650> whatever

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
also move the juggernaut to whatever

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.440 
also move the juggernaut to whatever
location<00:06:57.919> you<00:06:58.130> want<00:06:58.280> but<00:06:58.490> I'd<00:06:58.580> recommend<00:06:59.060> just

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
location you want but I'd recommend just

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.659 
location you want but I'd recommend just
be<00:06:59.630> careful<00:07:00.140> that<00:07:00.289> you<00:07:00.380> don't<00:07:00.500> end<00:07:01.190> up<00:07:01.460> hitting

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
be careful that you don't end up hitting

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.670 
be careful that you don't end up hitting
the<00:07:01.789> juggernaut<00:07:02.390> with<00:07:02.870> your<00:07:03.110> own<00:07:03.229> stuff<00:07:03.530> to

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
the juggernaut with your own stuff to

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.240 
the juggernaut with your own stuff to
try<00:07:03.860> new<00:07:04.340> yourself<00:07:04.700> also<00:07:05.450> uh<00:07:05.710> it<00:07:06.710> drops<00:07:06.979> care

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
try new yourself also uh it drops care

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.250 
try new yourself also uh it drops care
package<00:07:07.580> you<00:07:07.940> can<00:07:07.969> command<00:07:08.690> it<00:07:08.810> to<00:07:08.840> drop<00:07:09.080> care

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
package you can command it to drop care

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.779 
package you can command it to drop care
packages<00:07:09.650> wherever<00:07:09.950> so<00:07:10.190> ideally<00:07:10.640> you'd<00:07:10.760> want

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
packages wherever so ideally you'd want

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.580 
packages wherever so ideally you'd want

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
to drop the care packages near where

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.010 
to drop the care packages near where
your<00:07:12.710> teammates<00:07:12.860> are<00:07:13.570> but<00:07:14.570> the<00:07:14.840> only<00:07:14.960> thing

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020

your teammates are but the only thing
that<00:07:15.260> I'd<00:07:15.349> probably<00:07:15.380> say<00:07:15.830> is<00:07:15.979> probably

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
that I'd probably say is probably

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.970 
that I'd probably say is probably
painful<00:07:17.150> about<00:07:17.510> this<00:07:17.659> kill<00:07:17.900> streak<00:07:18.140> is

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
painful about this kill streak is

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.130 
painful about this kill streak is
it<00:07:19.070> is<00:07:19.280> too<00:07:19.580> low<00:07:20.150> to<00:07:20.180> the<00:07:20.390> ground<00:07:20.450> and<00:07:20.870> in<00:07:20.990> order

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
it is too low to the ground and in order

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.560 
it is too low to the ground and in order
to<00:07:21.230> move<00:07:21.470> from<00:07:22.100> flag<00:07:22.580> to<00:07:22.760> flag<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.090> takes<00:07:23.450> a

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570 
to move from flag to flag it takes a

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.970 
to move from flag to flag it takes a
long<00:07:23.720> time<00:07:23.780> if<00:07:24.140> there<00:07:24.230> was<00:07:24.350> a<00:07:24.410> way<00:07:24.440> to<00:07:24.530> zoom<00:07:24.830> out

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:24.980 
long time if there was a way to zoom out

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.100 
long time if there was a way to zoom out
and<00:07:25.190> zoom<00:07:25.820> back<00:07:25.970> in<00:07:26.210> it<00:07:26.300> would<00:07:26.420> be<00:07:26.540> probably<00:07:26.840> a

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
and zoom back in it would be probably a

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.380 
and zoom back in it would be probably a
little<00:07:27.230> bit<00:07:27.410> better<00:07:27.560> but<00:07:28.490> that's<00:07:28.760> uh<00:07:28.940> that<00:07:29.300> is

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390
