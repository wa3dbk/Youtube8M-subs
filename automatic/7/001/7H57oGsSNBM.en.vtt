00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 Hello 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 a few days ago I have on youtube 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.840
 a very nice video seen with one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.850
 Build up a 3 x 3 meter did 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.220
 to a tent-like construction 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 I'm in there right now 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.230
 Let 's take a look at the matter 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 outside 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.960
 we look at what've now from 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.960
 outside 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.440
 you need ten for this setup 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 tent pegs people who pay attention to weight 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 Now ten tent pegs will say that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 but it is not necessarily what 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.129
 I would like to lug around there 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 but then that one setup in this day 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 really the best protection against wind 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.579
 and weather has portman 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.470
 this setup in windy conditions 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.659
 you should absolutely pay attention that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 that was done so that the wind 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.340
 the back attacks and not in the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.659
 own into it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.659
 that would not be so great 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.140
 Here you can see the entrance of this one 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.299
 can if needed if it is now 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.490
 Example really should protect like 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 zoom out of buckets again 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.819
 You solve on both sides of the entrance 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 these strings work that inwards 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.600
 both sides and connects them 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 sleep 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.479
 with these cells one then one almost has 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.929
 a closed entrance and is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.799
 even better against bad weather 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.799
 protected 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.220
 The interior offers a lot of space for 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:12.019
 at least two persons and in case of emergency 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.019
 even have three people here 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.280
 I really like this setup 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 good because it is fast 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 build 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.270
 It offers a lot of protection 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.210
 bad weather influences if that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.170
 now face is snow or wind announced 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.270
 very important is also the interior 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.760
 offers so much space that there 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.280
 at least two people comfortably 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.350
 can stay overnight 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.440
 and in case of emergency there is still room there 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.300
 for a third person 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.790
 I hope this video was for you 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.360
 little informative and i could tell you 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.840
 give an excitement and say there 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.840
 bye
