00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 what is youtube mass to the scorpion 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.560
 Beck is the start for you and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to another 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 gameplay comes in people port today is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.510
 it's a typical one again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 sweaty fucking top round 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.030
 multi sweats here on the map of the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 draft with anton I then played 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 and with black at that time still as her 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 small was the game in december 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.810
 In any case, first gameplay already 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 half fucking years old and on each one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.350
 fall so to speak from the bloom time also in the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.730
 multi still could reasonably play 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.600
 was shortly after we all become ghost 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 the garbage bin bust ingolstadt 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 in any case 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 people today why the theme is so jost 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 anyway interested in no summer degree 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 the subject was but today it is time 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
 to pay for black ops you will 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 ask now what's going on again 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.079
 black ops two but do not talk 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 the other perspective and that's how it is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.110
 a bit so yes what us black ops 2 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 actually brought if I do not even 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 pull into 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 for example that I had to get one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.489
 whole story from the beginning 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 actually, with it , it also means so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 black ops came out that was like that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 in august there in august exactly what stops in the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 august the most 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 anton story in november 2012 the whole 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 came out of the way and it was like that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.670
 At the beginning everything only ground war came to fruition 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.170
 Hits played as the fight over crass 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 live gameplay by tesco and so on 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.180
 and then you like the first ones 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 past months and in 2000 with me did it go 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 not so good is what i mean i have 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 100 plus and wii I can not handle it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 It was just not good enough back then 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 thus no idea with pdw sweaty 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 like everyone else I have it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.140
 somehow do not shit this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.700
 fucking and finishing and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 then i have the motivation in the team 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 completely lost that was so in february 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.560
 or so and then came the time where we the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.880
 impact long greens have two 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.500
 months later, so I have almost two 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 months no second black ops 2 drawn 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 then came this whole nine love game 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 this gate without control orbit and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 so that the game right back 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 made because they drone the thing 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 cartridge role of the stop you just learn 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 finally how to use the weapon 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.329
 must work around that sounds maybe 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 weird but it's just because 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.299
 as soon as the bees keep their air you know 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.229
 that an adversary can come you 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.400
 much better on the same and too 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 concentrate and there I am from the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.149
 Twelve appetites for a 23 he has so far 27 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.890
 She guesses she has gone up altogether 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.680
 Of course it is very easy and on everyone 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 case people have to imagine it that way 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 then came this legendary multi team time 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 and without these legendary modes team time 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 now this reason comes this 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.719
 why do I actually have black ops 2? 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 as well as to demand in the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.060
 namely video was going on two so much 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.130
 Thanks to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.689
 because then came the modes team time 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.770
 and then came this legendary Amazon 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.880
 order I'm still a child 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.740
 I think I can do that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000
 butt later than I did then 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.410
 started again with anton in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300
 to contact me pretty much anton 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650
 would have given 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.730
 I would never have played with him 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.900
 my gameplay was not so damned 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.070
 I probably would have pulled up there 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.180
 not half as many now 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.100
 subscribers like me now so have 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 really no shit if we are so today 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.980
 say what has all the batteries of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.150
 I can actually say gamersware 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.740
 I also have all the batteries away from him 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.850
 without going all this together 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.900
 I never get so good at that 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.610
 gameplay longer play because of a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.020
 multi team have it also possible if 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.160
 today and multicultural teams had can 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.660
 You do not directly put a bullet in your head 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.350
 shoot because that takes anyway 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 Do not visit because the lobby is 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.040
 just so abnormally hampered though are 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.420
 In any case, people then came 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040
 i have ordered legendary amazon and i have 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.350
 my xbox controller ordered with me 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.270
 cable and my legendary adapter is 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.500
 so for years used so if one 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.210
 adapter searches with the xbox controller 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 can use a playstation and 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.300
 the other way round, the link to it is natural 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.800
 also in the video description available 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 and yes people you just have to 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.440
 pull so pure 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.820
 we just sweated on easy 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.260
 I have my mine without end 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.550
 nuclear plays just like the ones here 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.720
 was actually already relatively late 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.070
 but that was typical that marcel 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.930
 That's why I just wanted to show it that way 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.460
 much slower than the others still on 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.570
 early and second much less kills 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.190
 I've gotten that anton by now 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.210
 pretty much always on claranet always 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 a few more merkel but know like me 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.520
 that my mama compared to yes 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.150
 Finally with one of the best players 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.230
 at all 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.090
 and that's why I'm pretty 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.160
 happy with it and the people came then 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.900
 just this multitoe and it's me 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.220
 always say you have to introduce yourself 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.390
 now comes times throughout together so 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.980
 why you wanted to address the topic 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.300
 yes, that's what youtube really knows 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.070
 I do not earn good money , either 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.110
 that someone else had built the lies 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.330
 Just get to there everyone over 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.500
 let's say 100,000 cars have and 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.459
 picked up regularly and told you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.870
 that he does not earn much money with it 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.950
 he puts you to people one whole 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.570
 clear history and so it is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.220
 to be so with the live stream 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.840
 compared it fits a few cents than 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.550
 300 great price will definitely 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.040
 very good in any case 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.040
 In any case, I have quasi black ops 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.660
 2 and anton and multi animal and that 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 Decided if the people I have the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.770
 norby almost fucking my existence 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.480
 It is possible to say that everybody owe it to everyone 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.830
 case it is really violent so to speak 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.150
 you have to imagine if this 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.380
 months had not been when 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.790
 exactly one year if these months 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.260
 Not so blatant if I was not there 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.790
 this gamepad he played in this game 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.080
 what i really love about everything 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.340
 What really my call of duty is the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.080
 you can not say otherwise is so 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.010
 who tells me mw2 leaves or the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.870
 i can just arrive and say 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.580
 Fucking two is a lot much 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.940
 crass and has these months have 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.019
 I owe it to abnormal at the moment 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.340
 but not I am rich but that 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.230
 I learned good money that I can 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.580
 I definitely have to say that now 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.989
 take a look that this game is easy 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.850
 Of course, I was there too, of course 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.210
 the ass full of cereal for youtube 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.740
 of course and so on and so forth 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.509
 I would have this motivation from the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 I would not have pulled gameplay back then 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.940
 probably now what I have 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.360
 probably just too much but it 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.099
 had half I would say 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.509
 and should not be shit without this 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.610
 gameplays everyone who says otherwise 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.009
 just as good as that, for example 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.810
 For example, logix commented indeed 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.949
 also very very blatant but people believe 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.910
 her not that its succeed me too 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.560
 Part of it is that he is just like that 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.120
 from again crass scores uploads black 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.860
 ops 2 for example, I think, of course, 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.360
 already that I have people the cod videos 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.009
 also should play well cod because 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.270
 quite honestly that's otherwise otherwise 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.319
 Does not make sense or I mean 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.490
 why should you at the moment 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.080
 sit and watch as now again you can 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.669
 It looked just as good. I know what I am 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 my people in any case today 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.190
 Write what you text and the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.330
 rich comments and can access 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.370
 in each case one writes the comments 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.960
 hashtag thank you black ops 2 we are real 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.370
 without backup two I do not even know if 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.810
 anyone ever make any cod videos 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.440
 For example , I would say solution is one 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.789
 good example 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.199
 which has been easy since he was back in 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.280
 gone two really good signs that 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.690
 have taught you a bit how to 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.830
 that should play our since then 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.240
 he just returns full of motivation 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.289
