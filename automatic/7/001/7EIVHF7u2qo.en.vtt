how<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:50.449> Zopa<00:00:52.610> procreation

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
how it all looks like Zopa procreation

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
looks okay as you can see i'm not sure

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.150 
looks okay as you can see i'm not sure
about<00:01:01.050> those<00:01:01.230> nickels<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.800> doesn't<00:01:02.010> matter<00:01:02.129> i

me literally 45 minutes to put this
stand<00:02:25.750> together<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.609> as<00:02:27.760> simple<00:02:27.790> as

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
stand together it was as simple as

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.539 
stand together it was as simple as
putting<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.769> with<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.189> screw

putting this into that with one screw
but<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.510> thread<00:02:31.900> was<00:02:32.109> done<00:02:32.349> wrong

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
but as the thread was done wrong

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.539 
but as the thread was done wrong
initially<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.000> meant<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.370> screw<00:02:36.370> each

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
initially it meant that the screw each

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.220 
initially it meant that the screw each
time<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.909> went<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.329> wasn't<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.900> into<00:02:38.109> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
time it went in wasn't going into the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.369 
time it went in wasn't going into the
thread<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:38.859> doing<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.559 
get any dirtier I had to go like this in
I<00:02:55.510> look<00:02:56.139> at<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.290> fisting<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.939> had<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.209> go

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
I look at that fisting and it had to go

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.440 
I look at that fisting and it had to go
into<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.200> whole<00:02:59.439> day<00:03:00.189> for<00:03:00.430> dangle<00:03:00.819> couldn't

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
into the whole day for dangle couldn't

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.509 
into the whole day for dangle couldn't
be<00:03:01.540> dirty<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:02.230> such<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.409> dirty<00:03:02.620> one<00:03:02.859> anyway

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
be dirty about such a dirty one anyway

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.670 
be dirty about such a dirty one anyway
but<00:03:03.939> that's<00:03:04.329> how<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.540> worked<00:03:04.870> out<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.319> finally

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
but that's how it worked out and finally

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.809 
but that's how it worked out and finally
I<00:03:05.950> got<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:07.389> took<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.599> lot<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.489> me<00:03:09.489> shouting

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
I got it on it took a lot of me shouting

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.059 
I got it on it took a lot of me shouting
at<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.420> bloody<00:03:10.659> stab<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.319> get<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.739> put<00:03:12.040> it

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
at the bloody stab to get it in put it

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.129 
at the bloody stab to get it in put it
that<00:03:12.220> way<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.120> stands<00:03:13.419> perfectly<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:14.019> you

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
that way but it stands perfectly as you

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.939 
that way but it stands perfectly as you
can<00:03:14.290> see<00:03:14.440> there<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.650> no<00:03:14.949> there's<00:03:15.760> no<00:03:16.000> wait

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
can see there is no there's no wait

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.909 
can see there is no there's no wait
bringing<00:03:17.949> it<00:03:18.040> down<00:03:18.160> I'll<00:03:18.519> put<00:03:18.730> my<00:03:18.849> hand<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.239> it

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.710 
bringing it down I'll put my hand on it
and<00:03:20.919> it<00:03:21.099> really<00:03:21.489> takes<00:03:21.790> quite<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.150> lot<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.359> force

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
and it really takes quite a lot of force

and it really takes quite a lot of force
and<00:03:22.959> you're<00:03:23.680> not<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.069> really<00:03:24.310> be<00:03:24.430> making

well no problems right there and what I
was<00:05:19.860> talking<00:05:20.039> about<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:20.370> wire<00:05:20.639> over<00:05:20.879> here<00:05:21.210> as

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
was talking about the wire over here as

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.740 
was talking about the wire over here as
you<00:05:21.629> can<00:05:21.750> see<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:21.960> can<00:05:22.080> do<00:05:22.349> this<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:23.750> constantly

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
you can see I can do this and constantly

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.149 
you can see I can do this and constantly
loop<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.139> around<00:05:25.229> and<00:05:26.449> it<00:05:27.449> goes<00:05:27.930> really<00:05:28.560> really

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
loop it around and it goes really really

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.969 
loop it around and it goes really really
well<00:05:31.099> there<00:05:32.099> you<00:05:32.159> go<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:33.229> maybe<00:05:34.229> on<00:05:34.560> wines<00:05:34.800> but

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
well there you go so maybe on wines but

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.620 
well there you go so maybe on wines but
yeah<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.130> can<00:05:35.400> do<00:05:35.520> up<00:05:35.669> here<00:05:35.909> as<00:05:36.060> well<00:05:36.210> but<00:05:36.360> anyway

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
yeah I can do up here as well but anyway

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.629 
yeah I can do up here as well but anyway
point<00:05:37.289> is<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.770> keeps<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.159> nice<00:05:38.279> and<00:05:38.490> neat<00:05:38.610> and

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
point is it keeps it nice and neat and

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.409 
point is it keeps it nice and neat and
tidy<00:05:38.909> not<00:05:39.870> very<00:05:40.080> useful<00:05:40.380> if<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.849> ask<00:05:42.000> me<00:05:42.240> if

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
tidy not very useful if you ask me if

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.850 
tidy not very useful if you ask me if
well<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.229> know<00:05:43.289> if<00:05:43.440> you're<00:05:43.529> going<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> use

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
well you know if you're going to use

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.990 
well you know if you're going to use
your<00:05:44.009> headphones<00:05:44.580> hopefully<00:05:45.349> regularly<00:05:47.000> then

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
your headphones hopefully regularly then

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.119 
your headphones hopefully regularly then
you<00:05:48.629> know<00:05:48.719> it<00:05:49.080> would<00:05:49.229> be<00:05:49.319> kind<00:05:49.500> of<00:05:49.529> useless<00:05:49.710> so

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
you know it would be kind of useless so

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.790 
you know it would be kind of useless so

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
I'll put them over here you'll see my D

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.779 
I'll put them over here you'll see my D
to<00:05:54.539> thousands<00:05:55.020> over<00:05:55.139> there<00:05:55.379> let's<00:05:56.129> get<00:05:56.279> my<00:05:56.430> XP

goes around 10.5 to 11 centimeters and

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.150 
goes around 10.5 to 11 centimeters and
its<00:07:10.950> height<00:07:11.190> is<00:07:12.020> almost<00:07:15.169> by<00:07:16.169> is<00:07:16.470> 28

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
its height is almost by is 28

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.480 
its height is almost by is 28
centimeters<00:07:17.610> high<00:07:18.120> as<00:07:18.390> well<00:07:18.980> 28<00:07:19.980> sent<00:07:20.190> me<00:07:20.340> is

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
centimeters high as well 28 sent me is

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.469 
centimeters high as well 28 sent me is
this<00:07:20.640> highest<00:07:20.940> peak<00:07:21.360> up<00:07:21.840> there<00:07:22.550> so<00:07:23.550> I<00:07:24.060> hope

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
this highest peak up there so I hope

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.409 
this highest peak up there so I hope
that<00:07:24.690> helps<00:07:24.750> as<00:07:25.590> well<00:07:25.850> I'm<00:07:26.850> sure<00:07:27.060> if<00:07:27.150> you<00:07:27.210> want

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 
that helps as well I'm sure if you want

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:28.909 
that helps as well I'm sure if you want
to<00:07:27.479> know<00:07:27.570> dimensions<00:07:28.229> which<00:07:28.500> we<00:07:28.710> quite

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
to know dimensions which we quite

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.620 
to know dimensions which we quite
important<00:07:29.250> because<00:07:29.280> you<00:07:30.210> don't<00:07:30.360> know<00:07:30.450> if<00:07:30.540> it

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630 
important because you don't know if it

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.140 
important because you don't know if it
fits<00:07:30.870> around<00:07:31.020> your<00:07:31.260> desk<00:07:31.470> as<00:07:31.680> well<00:07:31.860> but<00:07:32.550> if

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
fits around your desk as well but if

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.460 
fits around your desk as well but if
you've<00:07:33.330> got<00:07:33.479> headphones<00:07:33.660> like<00:07:34.020> that<00:07:34.229> then

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
you've got headphones like that then

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.920 
you've got headphones like that then
you'd<00:07:34.650> probably<00:07:34.890> want<00:07:35.220> a<00:07:35.690> reasonable<00:07:36.690> height

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
you'd probably want a reasonable height

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.890 
you'd probably want a reasonable height
and<00:07:37.290> a<00:07:37.320> reasonable<00:07:37.800> size<00:07:38.660> because<00:07:39.660> also

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
and a reasonable size because also

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.090 
and a reasonable size because also
because<00:07:40.140> the<00:07:40.200> thickness<00:07:40.500> of<00:07:40.590> the<00:07:40.710> word<00:07:40.860> means

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100 
because the thickness of the word means

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.290 
because the thickness of the word means
that<00:07:41.280> it's<00:07:41.430> quite<00:07:41.610> heavy<00:07:41.760> so<00:07:41.910> it's<00:07:42.120> not<00:07:42.180> gonna

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 
that it's quite heavy so it's not gonna

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.750 
that it's quite heavy so it's not gonna
fall<00:07:42.510> down<00:07:42.570> I<00:07:42.990> then<00:07:43.860> in<00:07:44.100> comparison<00:07:44.550> to<00:07:44.640> this

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760 
fall down I then in comparison to this

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.710 
fall down I then in comparison to this
for<00:07:44.970> example<00:07:45.180> thing<00:07:45.660> i<00:07:45.780> bought<00:07:45.960> from<00:07:47.540> house<00:07:48.540> of

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
for example thing i bought from house of

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.870 
for example thing i bought from house of
fraser<00:07:48.960> you<00:07:49.380> can<00:07:49.500> see<00:07:49.590> a<00:07:49.620> huge<00:07:49.860> difference<00:07:49.890> the

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 
fraser you can see a huge difference the

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.240 
fraser you can see a huge difference the
thickness<00:07:51.300> of<00:07:51.419> the<00:07:51.570> wood<00:07:52.160> obviously<00:07:53.160> the

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.250 
thickness of the wood obviously the

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.150 
thickness of the wood obviously the
quality<00:07:53.610> of<00:07:53.640> the<00:07:53.790> wood<00:07:53.910> but<00:07:54.530> yeah<00:07:55.530> it<00:07:55.860> was<00:07:55.950> well

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 
quality of the wood but yeah it was well

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.070 
quality of the wood but yeah it was well
worth<00:07:56.190> it<00:07:56.550> i<00:07:56.610> bought<00:07:57.060> this<00:07:57.150> for<00:07:57.300> 750<00:07:57.900> and<00:07:58.020> i

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
worth it i bought this for 750 and i

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.830 
worth it i bought this for 750 and i
bought<00:07:58.229> that<00:07:58.380> for<00:07:58.590> about<00:07:58.680> 25<00:07:59.250> so<00:07:59.970> i<00:08:00.450> definitely

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 
bought that for about 25 so i definitely

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.930 
bought that for about 25 so i definitely
thinks<00:08:01.229> it's<00:08:01.560> a<00:08:01.650> nice<00:08:01.770> investment<00:08:02.340> for<00:08:02.820> sure

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.370 
these were kind of flimsy but these

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.800 
these were kind of flimsy but these
actually<00:08:05.790> work<00:08:05.970> very<00:08:06.300> very<00:08:06.390> well<00:08:06.630> with<00:08:07.110> my<00:08:07.260> ex
