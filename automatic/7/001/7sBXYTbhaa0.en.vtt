cells another benefit of green teas that
has<00:03:34.890> been<00:03:35.070> shown<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> prevent<00:03:35.880> heart<00:03:36.810> disease

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
has been shown to prevent heart disease

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.340 
has been shown to prevent heart disease
this<00:03:38.760> happens<00:03:39.300> as<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:41.330> helps<00:03:42.330> inhibit<00:03:43.050> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
this happens as it helps inhibit the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.270 
this happens as it helps inhibit the
formation<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:44.190> abnormal<00:03:45.290> blood<00:03:46.290> clots<00:03:46.860> so

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
formation of abnormal blood clots so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.229 
formation of abnormal blood clots so
those<00:03:48.090> blood<00:03:48.660> clots<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:49.080> would<00:03:49.380> lead<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
those blood clots that would lead to

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.990 
those blood clots that would lead to
heart<00:03:51.239> disease<00:03:51.680> are<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:53.190> lowered<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
heart disease are actually lowered and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.990 
heart disease are actually lowered and
it<00:03:54.660> also<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.110> can<00:03:55.410> see<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.980> lower<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
it also you can see the lower in the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.420 
it also you can see the lower in the
clogging<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.600> arteries<00:03:58.110> as<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.440> benefit<00:03:59.070> from

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
clogging of arteries as a benefit from
