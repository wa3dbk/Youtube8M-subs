the problems that we face on complicated
at<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.520> level<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:42.960> simple<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.410> thing

at one level the very simple I thing
which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.699> that<00:00:45.390> we've

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
which is just that there that we've

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
which is just that there that we've
disconnected<00:00:46.410> ourselves<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> natural

disconnected ourselves and we've started

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
disconnected ourselves and we've started
to<00:00:54.480> take<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> path<00:00:55.199> where<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.980> believe<00:00:56.519> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to take a path where we believe that
