surround<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.410> had<00:00:08.040> extra<00:00:08.550> granite<00:00:09.450> so

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
surround on it and had extra granite so

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.020 
surround on it and had extra granite so
I<00:00:09.780> cut<00:00:10.530> some<00:00:10.650> granite<00:00:10.950> then<00:00:11.309> put<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.790> top

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I cut some granite then put that on top

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.680 
I cut some granite then put that on top
of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.380> steel<00:00:13.380> tables

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.140 

so<00:00:18.230> here<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:18.530> bio<00:00:18.710> drill<00:00:19.280> and<00:00:19.640> it<00:00:19.730> has<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.850> cast

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
so here is bio drill and it has a cast

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.210 
so here is bio drill and it has a cast
iron<00:00:20.360> body<00:00:20.750> all<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.590> parts<00:00:21.860> on<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.010> inside

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
iron body all the parts on the inside

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.400 
iron body all the parts on the inside
wore<00:00:22.670> out<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.119> I<00:00:23.150> decided<00:00:23.570> to<00:00:23.689> make<00:00:23.840> a<00:00:23.900> smoker

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
wore out so I decided to make a smoker

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.339 
wore out so I decided to make a smoker
since<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.490> gas<00:00:25.700> grill<00:00:25.970> doesn't<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:27.110> that

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
since the gas grill doesn't have that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.530 
since the gas grill doesn't have that
charcoal<00:00:27.860> flavor<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.790> missed<00:00:29.119> that<00:00:29.300> some

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
charcoal flavor and I I missed that some

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.440 
charcoal flavor and I I missed that some
times<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.640> I'm<00:00:31.759> going<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.000> show<00:00:32.150> you<00:00:32.210> what<00:00:32.419> I
