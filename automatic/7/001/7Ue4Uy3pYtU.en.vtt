00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:29.980
 It's the personal afternoon here at the fishing port. 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.960
 montenegro there we will give a tip 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.960
 for you there about fishing for 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.150
 Winter how personal we have been walking. 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.900
 the fishing industry and staff has been 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.770
 people 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.989
 on the question of how to launch a ladder 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.840
 because love escapes is not the case with 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.820
 masses of the people, but in all 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.879
 others but when the person goes fishing there 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.460
 has difficulty in the sense of how 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.230
 put this and we'll try 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.270
 to give you a touch is to 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.789
 people are going to do it for you 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.739
 scale this type medium up to 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.710
 reach the point of attainment and where 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.869
 our staff and timber that logical 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.860
 the major issues will be centralized in the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.560
 middle of the lake 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.380
 We are going through a phase of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.459
 cold now where the fish are very 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.000
 larger 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.700
 It takes a very great sensitivity 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.940
 requires some techniques to 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.390
 This, for example, had a 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.429
 lake like this here for example a 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.110
 part of the lake has a meter and a half and 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.319
 other party has another four meters 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.810
 part is five and a half then the fish 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:41.830
 mainly he will choose the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.869
 less bad place for him're up to 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.849
 People have the same temperature I had. 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 and would have no problem with 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.170
 since they were rising more than 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.920
 as he did not know nor are in the background 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.450
 deep inside alternates the depth of the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 So we have a problem with 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.310
 then temperature changes beyond 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.410
 people have a good bait in winter to 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.509
 people do not even have to look 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.270
 is located the fish then you arrive 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.920
 in a fishing boat today as not 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.769
 many people fishing even in the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.099
 winter gives you the chance to play in a 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.530
 He did not take part to the other with the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.599
 another side risked another one until 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.690
 you hit the depth that the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.239
 Pichita, it's more for that too. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.319
 that has to arrive has that the staff has 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 put to the mass what he does he does 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.629
 a thong puts the hook gives an example 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.840
 More or less like I 'm doing. 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.140
 and pick it up at our ready it goes 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.019
 pick up a lot of dough in hand will pick up 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.670
 the hook put in the middle here and tighten 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.709
 It's to do 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.620
 the sky is going to give a form placed this 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.780
 but what happens when he gets the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.360
 bait and squeezed anyway without 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.890
 direction without anything that will happen to the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.480
 This is the scale here. 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.660
 so you ask for membership box not 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 is centralized in the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 Look ok, I got it. I put it. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.010
 Like I did with this one, but she got 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.090
 side 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.069
 it weakens further that neither 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.739
 mass of the neck is a marvel more 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.329
 it is still a mass, then the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.569
 happens that when the person goes 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.810
 launch is very much on the side of the 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.609
 and when it was expression in 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.260
 The top she dropped 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.329
 Look, it's almost gone. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.549
 Entire and the sun is what happens 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.819
 we indicate to you that this is 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.349
 the next you'll get but squeeze 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.440
 first hand 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.079
 This gives a very great consistency, 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.370
 ready after she's pretty sure that 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.620
 you already pressed 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.430
 then you come put the hook in the center 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.280
 of the mass 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.190
 see that it is already balanced 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.380
 now I'm going to format it in bulk now 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.150
 Yes, I'm going to work is shaping her like 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.160
 a little ball like the kitchen like you 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.570
 prefer to make it easier for 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.299
 play and ready 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.920
 this makes it centralized 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.350
 OK 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.780
 If I have two-striped fishing I 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.700
 I'll do the same in the other in the sun. 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.120
 and I'll have it twice and balanced 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.530
 now I'll try to drop the bait 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.280
 when I did with the other one I was wrong 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.110
 placed 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.580
 You'll see that it's from here it goes. 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.670
 being in the center of the mass 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.350
 when they realized the return completely 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.150
 centralized looks six and a half but ok 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.430
 this using more of that technique than we 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.620
 we spent on that first video that they give 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.390
 distance in the line of plus or minus one 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.640
 five and a half meters 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.440
 you will throw the two stripes together or 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.390
 one're only 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.790
 when you see the stick you will not have 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.580
 as pressure on the bait is the bait that goes 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.730
 be taking the line for you it's right 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.950
 So the one we've been through now is the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.380
 scheme so you can play 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.450
 mass but any other adhesive and that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.640
 Do you have beauty fishing? 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.050
 here we are using indicates for 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.600
 When did you go fishing with two 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.550
 resolve to put a spinner with three 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:30.200
 Outings are two little puppies enjoying good 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:33.220
 2 to 1 with 2/6 or 3/0 to steal because 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.490
 the sun 2 or 3 based it gives you still 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.260
 by the fact of the size of the hook and help 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.870
 you have a better consistency the mass 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.800
 at the bidding time it helps you protect 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.260
 the dough to escape from the beauty hook and 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.420
 line as we put it I use a 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.300
 line fluorescent green you can 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.490
 wear blue white as long as you see 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.140
 her because bottom fishing she is not 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.390
 that the party of being a nightclub 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.930
 The boy sinks you have the 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:06.140
 ball is easy to catch with fishing 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.540
 there is no such background 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.160
 then you have to have a 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.560
 perception in some way if you 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.300
 To insure ours is passing energy through 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.620
 difficult job but then will close its 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.600
 your line 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.180
 the track will have to be placed in the 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.160
 support what happens to you with 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.340
 the visible line 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.200
 You'll see the line running. 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.370
 especially on a sunny day 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.639
 if you are using the line 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.560
 transparent 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.199
 it is that you do not see the 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.289
 line the fish takes your bait and you do not 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.550
 realized how bait is exceptional 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.830
 action 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.080
 He'll certainly take yours. 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.039
 so you will not see is that if 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.229
 visible 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.969
 he even pulled you're looking at 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.889
 side is distracted you end up seeing 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:53.490
 who had action on the line 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:57.650
 run there hooked a fish and good beauty 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.650
 thanks people until the next 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.660

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.660
