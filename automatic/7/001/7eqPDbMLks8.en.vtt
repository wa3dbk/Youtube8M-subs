three different control options you can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350 
three different control options you can
use<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> accelerometer<00:01:25.280> actually<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
use the accelerometer actually or you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.469 
use the accelerometer actually or you
can<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:28.009> some<00:01:29.009> different<00:01:29.579> variation<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
can use some different variation of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.069 
can use some different variation of
on-screen<00:01:30.900> touch<00:01:31.430> controls<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.450> default

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on-screen touch controls or this default

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.380 
on-screen touch controls or this default
layout<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.670> joystick<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
layout which is just the joystick and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.560 
layout which is just the joystick and
two<00:01:36.930> buttons<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.610> personally<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
two buttons and I personally think the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.929 
two buttons and I personally think the
default<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.860> easiest<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> use

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
default one is the easiest one to use

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.080 
default one is the easiest one to use
and<00:01:42.299> you'll<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> action<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.880> few

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.690 
and you'll see it in action in a few
seconds<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> longest<00:01:47.430> load

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
seconds here this is the longest load

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520

jumps<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:49.950> into<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> game<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.930> loads

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
jumps right into the game so it loads

difficulty setting which actually makes

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.250 
difficulty setting which actually makes
a<00:03:33.060> big<00:03:33.239> difference<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:35.840> there's<00:03:36.840> plenty

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
a big difference here and there's plenty

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.800 
a big difference here and there's plenty
of<00:03:37.440> like<00:03:38.160> moves<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.329> even

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
of like moves that you can do even

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.069 
of like moves that you can do even
though<00:03:39.989> there's<00:03:40.260> no<00:03:40.940> actual<00:03:41.940> moves<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
though there's no actual moves that you

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.860 
though there's no actual moves that you
can<00:03:43.159> do<00:03:44.159> here<00:03:44.609> like<00:03:44.819> you<00:03:45.090> can't<00:03:45.389> do<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
can do here like you can't do the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.050 
can do here like you can't do the
scissors<00:03:46.470> or<00:03:46.739> anything<00:03:47.099> by<00:03:47.250> doing<00:03:47.280> any<00:03:47.730> move

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
scissors or anything by doing any move

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.599 
scissors or anything by doing any move
combination<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.500> can<00:03:49.650> still<00:03:49.949> shoot<00:03:50.190> players

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
combination you can still shoot players

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.390 
combination you can still shoot players
just<00:03:51.060> by<00:03:51.180> using<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.720> joystick<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.590> that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
just by using the joystick and that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.140 
just by using the joystick and that
still<00:03:53.819> makes<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.629> game<00:03:54.840> plenty<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.379> fun<00:03:55.620> and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
still makes the game plenty of fun and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.780 
still makes the game plenty of fun and
then<00:03:57.150> shooting<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.989> definitely<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.919> challenge

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
then shooting is definitely a challenge

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.509 
then shooting is definitely a challenge
but<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.299> satisfying<00:04:00.930> challenge<00:04:04.519> taking

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
but it's a satisfying challenge taking

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.180 
but it's a satisfying challenge taking
the<00:04:05.760> corner<00:04:06.329> kicks<00:04:06.599> here<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.409> probably<00:04:07.590> one

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
the corner kicks here it's probably one

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.759 
the corner kicks here it's probably one
of<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.400> funnest<00:04:08.639> parts<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.239> game<00:04:09.449> here<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
of the funnest parts of the game here it

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.059 
of the funnest parts of the game here it
usually<00:04:11.400> leads<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.970> some<00:04:12.180> good<00:04:12.419> results<00:04:12.739> if<00:04:13.739> we

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
usually leads to some good results if we

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.550 
usually leads to some good results if we
chip<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.699> here<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.329> then<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.900> go<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:16.409> that

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
chip it in here and then we go for that

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.319 
chip it in here and then we go for that
patter<00:04:16.979> oh<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.970> coaly<00:04:18.209> gets<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:21.150> it's<00:04:21.269> a

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
patter oh the coaly gets it so it's a

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.080 
patter oh the coaly gets it so it's a
really<00:04:21.539> great<00:04:21.659> game<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.320> by<00:04:22.800> default<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
really great game and by default the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.500 
really great game and by default the
games<00:04:24.720> last<00:04:25.110> five<00:04:25.650> minutes<00:04:26.070> each<00:04:26.340> half<00:04:26.729> you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
games last five minutes each half you

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.510 
games last five minutes each half you
can<00:04:27.720> set<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.320> last<00:04:28.530> ten<00:04:29.039> minutes<00:04:29.190> each

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
can set that to last ten minutes each

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.820 
can set that to last ten minutes each
half<00:04:29.849> and<00:04:30.150> then<00:04:30.750> you'll<00:04:30.960> get<00:04:31.139> double<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
half and then you'll get double the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.710 
half and then you'll get double the
gameplay<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.370> course

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
gameplay of course

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.300 
gameplay of course
otherwise<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.050> game<00:04:36.259> is<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.919> in

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
otherwise the game is just in

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.290 
otherwise the game is just in
fast-forward<00:04:38.300> time<00:04:38.780> as<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.319> see<00:04:39.349> it<00:04:40.009> is<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.639> 45

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
fast-forward time as you see it is a 45

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.740 
fast-forward time as you see it is a 45
minute<00:04:41.569> half<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:44.120> whistle<00:04:44.479> blows

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
minute half here and the whistle blows

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.270 
minute half here and the whistle blows
after<00:04:45.229> 45<00:04:46.069> minutes<00:04:46.990> but<00:04:47.990> 45<00:04:48.830> minutes<00:04:49.130> is

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
after 45 minutes but 45 minutes is

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.320 
after 45 minutes but 45 minutes is
accelerated<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.300> goes<00:04:50.539> by<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:50.870> five<00:04:51.110> minutes

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
accelerated so goes by in five minutes
