pure<00:02:26.950> value<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.520> mindset<00:02:28.050> my<00:02:29.050> only<00:02:29.320> gripe

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
pure value that mindset my only gripe

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.710 
pure value that mindset my only gripe
here<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.100> with<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.430> size<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.300> size<00:02:31.480> isn't

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
here is with the size and the size isn't

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.690 
here is with the size and the size isn't
bad<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.380> know<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.740> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> typical

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
bad I know it's kind of like a typical

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.210 
bad I know it's kind of like a typical
size<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.920> one<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.070> those

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
size and it's just one of those

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.440 
size and it's just one of those
situations<00:02:36.400> where<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:36.970> we<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.330> make

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
situations where I think we can make

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.720 
situations where I think we can make
more<00:02:37.900> value<00:02:38.410> here<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.610> if

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
more value here you know I think that if

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.240 
more value here you know I think that if
a<00:02:39.820> fish<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.690> with<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.170> overpair<00:02:41.709> he's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
a fish is in here with an overpair he's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
a fish is in here with an overpair he's
gonna<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.610> relatively<00:02:43.030> inelastic<00:02:43.330> you're

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
gonna be relatively inelastic you're

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.540 
gonna be relatively inelastic you're
gonna<00:02:44.020> call<00:02:44.290> pretty<00:02:44.500> much<00:02:44.680> regardless<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
gonna call pretty much regardless of the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.979 
gonna call pretty much regardless of the
size<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.000> long<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.480> bet<00:02:46.720> say<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
size so long as you don't bet say a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.170 
size so long as you don't bet say a
hundred<00:02:47.470> eighty<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.610> think<00:02:48.730> if<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.060> were<00:02:49.150> to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
hundred eighty so I think if we were to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.759 
hundred eighty so I think if we were to
bet<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.750> something<00:02:49.989> like<00:02:50.140> forty<00:02:50.620> or

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
bet this for something like forty or

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.860 
bet this for something like forty or
forty-five<00:02:51.160> or<00:02:51.340> even<00:02:51.820> fifty<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.510> he's<00:02:52.750> gonna

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
forty-five or even fifty that he's gonna

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.780 
forty-five or even fifty that he's gonna
continue<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.769> those<00:02:53.890> over<00:02:54.190> pairs<00:02:54.459> just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
continue with all those over pairs just

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.370 
continue with all those over pairs just
the<00:02:54.940> same<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.540> because<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.080> I'd<00:02:56.230> really

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the same so because of that I'd really

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.140 
the same so because of that I'd really
like<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.709> see<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.980> bigger<00:02:57.220> bed<00:02:57.519> size<00:02:57.760> here

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
like to see the bigger bed size here

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.210 
like to see the bigger bed size here

up<00:03:08.920> getting<00:03:09.130> called<00:03:09.400> Queen<00:03:10.239> on<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.540> turn<00:03:11.110> he

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
up getting called Queen on the turn he

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.640 
up getting called Queen on the turn he
checks<00:03:12.010> here<00:03:12.610> decided<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.090> bet<00:03:13.239> again<00:03:13.650> so

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
checks here decided to bet again so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.710 
checks here decided to bet again so
again<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:15.040> see<00:03:15.190> hero<00:03:15.430> coming<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.910> for<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> little

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
again we see hero coming in for a little

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.410 
again we see hero coming in for a little
bit<00:03:16.870> more<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.290> typical<00:03:17.650> bet<00:03:18.370> size<00:03:18.670> but<00:03:19.060> again

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
bit more of a typical bet size but again

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.850 
bit more of a typical bet size but again
I<00:03:19.540> think<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:19.989> could<00:03:20.230> definitely<00:03:20.500> be

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
I think that this could definitely be

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.699 
I think that this could definitely be
bigger<00:03:21.250> as<00:03:21.579> well<00:03:21.959> now<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.019> Queen<00:03:23.320> isn't<00:03:23.500> my

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
bigger as well now the Queen isn't my

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.870 
bigger as well now the Queen isn't my
favorite<00:03:24.070> car<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> world<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.730> certainly

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
favorite car in the world it certainly

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.810 
favorite car in the world it certainly
does<00:03:25.239> apply<00:03:25.510> pressure<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.230> eights<00:03:26.980> nines<00:03:27.340> tens

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
does apply pressure to eights nines tens

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.180 
does apply pressure to eights nines tens
jacks<00:03:28.269> all<00:03:28.510> those<00:03:28.690> kind<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:28.989> things<00:03:29.049> but<00:03:29.920> by

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
jacks all those kind of things but by

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.009 
jacks all those kind of things but by
the<00:03:30.250> same<00:03:30.459> token<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:31.060> still<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.810> bad

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
the same token I still think that a bad

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.600 
the same token I still think that a bad
opponent<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.620> still<00:03:32.799> gonna<00:03:32.920> make<00:03:33.100> plenty

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
opponent is still gonna make plenty

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.910 
opponent is still gonna make plenty
enough<00:03:33.700> second<00:03:34.180> best<00:03:34.360> mistakes<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.769> also

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
enough second best mistakes and I also

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.319 
enough second best mistakes and I also
again<00:03:36.340> think<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.820> could<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.060> made<00:03:37.180> more

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
again think that we could have made more

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.780 
again think that we could have made more
value<00:03:37.810> with<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> bigger<00:03:38.530> flop<00:03:39.070> see<00:03:39.340> bet<00:03:39.519> and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
value with a bigger flop see bet and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.130 
value with a bigger flop see bet and
again<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.239> bigger<00:03:40.390> flop<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:40.810> event<00:03:40.989> also

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
again the bigger flop see event also

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.630 
again the bigger flop see event also
does<00:03:41.410> kind<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.680> account<00:03:41.980> for<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.280> times<00:03:42.519> you

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
does kind of account for the times you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.720 
does kind of account for the times you
do<00:03:42.970> catch<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.480> turn<00:03:43.690> card<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.380> maybe<00:03:45.100> pauses

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
do catch a turn card that maybe pauses

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.060 
do catch a turn card that maybe pauses
action<00:03:46.209> or<00:03:46.510> slows<00:03:46.959> your<00:03:47.230> opponent<00:03:47.650> down<00:03:47.860> you

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
action or slows your opponent down you

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.039 
action or slows your opponent down you
get<00:03:48.220> more<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.549> that<00:03:48.579> immediate<00:03:49.360> value<00:03:49.810> right

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
get more of that immediate value right

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.479 
get more of that immediate value right
there<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.620> again<00:03:50.920> especially<00:03:51.070> when<00:03:51.400> they're

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
there and again especially when they're

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.100 
there and again especially when they're
going<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.640> be<00:03:51.760> inelastic<00:03:51.970> that's<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.810> good

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
going to be inelastic that's a good

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.400 
going to be inelastic that's a good
thing<00:03:53.350> for<00:03:53.380> us<00:03:54.299> but<00:03:55.299> in<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.600> situation<00:03:55.810> you

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
thing for us but in this situation you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.050 
thing for us but in this situation you
know<00:03:56.560> at<00:03:56.680> least<00:03:56.860> I'm<00:03:57.070> happy<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.489> heroes<00:03:57.790> Betty

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
know at least I'm happy the heroes Betty

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.490 
know at least I'm happy the heroes Betty
and<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:58.450> think<00:03:58.600> again<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.140> bet<00:03:59.290> size

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and I just think again the bet size

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.199 
and I just think again the bet size
could<00:03:59.739> be<00:03:59.829> a<00:03:59.860> little<00:04:00.130> bit<00:04:00.220> larger<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
could be a little bit larger in the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.030 
could be a little bit larger in the
situation<00:04:01.720> maybe<00:04:01.959> ninety<00:04:02.440> ninety<00:04:02.829> five

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
situation maybe ninety ninety five

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.400 
situation maybe ninety ninety five
something<00:04:03.519> in<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.700> ballpark<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.200> small

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
something in that ballpark so the small

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.560 
something in that ballpark so the small
blind<00:04:05.530> decides<00:04:05.829> to<00:04:05.980> call<00:04:06.190> deuce<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.359> river

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
blind decides to call deuce on the river

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.110 
blind decides to call deuce on the river
not<00:04:08.320> changing<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.070> too<00:04:09.250> much<00:04:09.400> obviously<00:04:09.640> pairs

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
not changing to too much obviously pairs

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.420 
not changing to too much obviously pairs
the<00:04:10.299> board<00:04:10.540> were<00:04:10.690> behind<00:04:10.930> boats<00:04:11.320> but<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.130> don't

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the board were behind boats but I don't

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.520 
the board were behind boats but I don't
think<00:04:12.609> there's<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.820> ton<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.120> those<00:04:13.420> he<00:04:14.230> checks

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
think there's a ton of those he checks

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.050 
think there's a ton of those he checks
here<00:04:15.190> decides<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:15.609> a<00:04:15.670> bet

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
here decides it's a bet

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.479 
here decides it's a bet
so<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:16.989> like<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.229> Heroes<00:04:17.680> betting<00:04:18.070> I'm<00:04:18.280> just

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
so I like to Heroes betting I'm just

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.890 
so I like to Heroes betting I'm just
really<00:04:18.760> not<00:04:18.880> sure<00:04:19.120> why<00:04:19.239> we're<00:04:19.419> choosing<00:04:19.599> this

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
really not sure why we're choosing this

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.810 
really not sure why we're choosing this
bet<00:04:20.140> size<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> think<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.280> definitely<00:04:21.669> on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
bet size I think this is definitely on

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.520 
bet size I think this is definitely on
the<00:04:21.849> smaller<00:04:22.180> side<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.960> know<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.260> look

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
the smaller side you know if we look

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.480 
the smaller side you know if we look
here<00:04:24.010> we

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
here we

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.129 
here we
in<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.819> hand<00:04:25.060> with<00:04:25.300> I'm<00:04:25.569> sorry<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.810> started<00:04:26.050> the

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
in the hand with I'm sorry I started the

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.770 
in the hand with I'm sorry I started the
river<00:04:26.289> with<00:04:26.470> about<00:04:26.650> 240<00:04:27.280> 286<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.180> middle<00:04:28.509> I

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
river with about 240 286 in the middle I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.809 
river with about 240 286 in the middle I
really<00:04:29.740> have<00:04:29.830> no<00:04:29.979> problem<00:04:30.340> with<00:04:30.400> shoving

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
really have no problem with shoving

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.550 
really have no problem with shoving
again<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.509> you<00:04:31.599> think<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.900> small<00:04:32.110> mines<00:04:32.319> still

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
again if you think the small mines still

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.469 
again if you think the small mines still
gonna<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.800> inelastic<00:04:33.009> I<00:04:33.669> mean<00:04:33.849> he<00:04:33.970> did<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> cold

hand the river doesn't really change too
much<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.759> actually<00:04:42.880> may<00:04:43.180> make<00:04:43.599> him<00:04:43.750> feel<00:04:43.960> a

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
much it actually may make him feel a

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.170 
much it actually may make him feel a
little<00:04:44.050> bit<00:04:44.289> more<00:04:44.349> comfortable<00:04:45.220> if<00:04:45.520> he<00:04:45.580> did

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
little bit more comfortable if he did

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.570 
little bit more comfortable if he did
say<00:04:46.449> like<00:04:46.750> have<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> jacks<00:04:47.319> or<00:04:47.500> whatever<00:04:47.740> board

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
pair doesn't really freaked him out

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.719 
pair doesn't really freaked him out
versus<00:04:50.470> say<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.710> river<00:04:50.860> being<00:04:51.099> a<00:04:51.250> three<00:04:51.520> or

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
versus say the river being a three or

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.120 
versus say the river being a three or
nice<00:04:51.940> or<00:04:52.120> something<00:04:52.419> like<00:04:52.509> that<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.009> this

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
nice or something like that so in this

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.249 
nice or something like that so in this
situation<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:55.090> bit<00:04:55.509> as<00:04:55.630> big<00:04:55.840> as<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.050> think

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
situation just bit as big as you think

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.080 
situation just bit as big as you think
that<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.620> get<00:04:56.770> called<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.370> fissure<00:04:57.819> he

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
that you can get called the fissure he

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.550 
that you can get called the fissure he
is<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.389> more<00:04:58.539> I'm<00:04:58.659> just<00:04:58.780> gonna<00:04:58.960> shove<00:04:59.259> here

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
is the more I'm just gonna shove here

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.320 
is the more I'm just gonna shove here
and<00:04:59.889> again<00:05:00.159> I'm<00:05:00.340> not<00:05:00.370> really<00:05:00.669> super<00:05:00.880> scared<00:05:01.240> of

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
and again I'm not really super scared of

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.270 
and again I'm not really super scared of
boats<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:02.650> know<00:05:02.680> if<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:02.949> look<00:05:03.069> at<00:05:03.159> the<00:05:03.220> way

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
boats you know if you look at the way

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.460 
boats you know if you look at the way
the<00:05:03.400> hand<00:05:03.610> played<00:05:03.880> out<00:05:04.060> if<00:05:04.330> he<00:05:04.870> had<00:05:05.169> flopped

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
the hand played out if he had flopped

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.290 
the hand played out if he had flopped
something<00:05:05.949> like<00:05:06.159> pocket<00:05:06.699> fives<00:05:06.880> back<00:05:07.150> at

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
something like pocket fives back at

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.059 
something like pocket fives back at
forest<00:05:07.599> pocket<00:05:07.870> deuces<00:05:08.050> don't<00:05:08.620> we<00:05:08.740> think<00:05:08.889> he

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
forest pocket deuces don't we think he

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.620 
forest pocket deuces don't we think he
probably<00:05:09.340> would<00:05:09.699> have<00:05:09.909> played<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.389> more

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
probably would have played it more

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.230 
probably would have played it more
aggressively<00:05:11.319> somewhere<00:05:12.220> whether<00:05:12.819> that<00:05:13.090> be

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
aggressively somewhere whether that be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.700 
aggressively somewhere whether that be
in<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.360> flop<00:05:13.659> or<00:05:13.840> whether<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.139> be<00:05:14.259> in<00:05:14.289> a<00:05:14.470> turn

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
in the flop or whether that be in a turn

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.279 
in the flop or whether that be in a turn
whatever<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:16.120> also<00:05:16.419> if<00:05:16.539> he's<00:05:16.659> bad<00:05:16.900> enough<00:05:17.169> to

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
whatever and also if he's bad enough to

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.510 
whatever and also if he's bad enough to
cold-call<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.740> three<00:05:18.009> bit<00:05:18.159> out<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.310> position

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
cold-call a three bit out of position

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.490 
cold-call a three bit out of position
with<00:05:18.940> pocket<00:05:19.270> fives<00:05:19.449> pocket<00:05:19.840> fours<00:05:20.050> or<00:05:20.169> pocket

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
with pocket fives pocket fours or pocket

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.710 
with pocket fives pocket fours or pocket
deuces<00:05:20.710> well<00:05:21.460> again<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.300> don't<00:05:22.389> have<00:05:22.599> a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
deuces well again I don't have a

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.360 
deuces well again I don't have a
tremendous<00:05:23.199> amount<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.560> respect<00:05:23.889> for<00:05:24.099> that<00:05:24.250> in

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
tremendous amount of respect for that in

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.360 
tremendous amount of respect for that in
the<00:05:24.460> first<00:05:24.699> place<00:05:25.169> so<00:05:26.169> in<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:26.590> situation<00:05:26.770> it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
the first place so in this situation it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.560 
the first place so in this situation it
gets<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.580> little<00:05:27.699> bit<00:05:27.909> weird<00:05:28.090> because<00:05:28.210> we<00:05:28.449> do

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
gets a little bit weird because we do

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.300 
gets a little bit weird because we do
end<00:05:28.750> up<00:05:28.840> facing<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.259> check<00:05:29.590> shove<00:05:29.889> on<00:05:30.159> the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
end up facing the check shove on the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.709 
end up facing the check shove on the
river<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.940> at<00:05:31.060> this<00:05:31.180> point<00:05:31.419> we're<00:05:31.630> getting

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
river and at this point we're getting

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.600 
river and at this point we're getting
roughly<00:05:32.199> four<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:32.500> a<00:05:32.530> half<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.889> one<00:05:33.099> need<00:05:33.580> to

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
roughly four and a half to one need to

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.550 
roughly four and a half to one need to
be<00:05:33.789> good<00:05:33.969> at<00:05:34.090> least<00:05:34.180> 18<00:05:34.690> percent<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.229> time

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
be good at least 18 percent of the time

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.820 
be good at least 18 percent of the time
and<00:05:35.919> here<00:05:36.849> decides<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.360> make<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.630> big<00:05:37.810> fold<00:05:38.110> so

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
and here decides to make the big fold so

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.570 
and here decides to make the big fold so
in<00:05:39.430> this<00:05:39.639> situation<00:05:39.990> I'm<00:05:40.990> not<00:05:41.050> folding<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:42.159> just

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
in this situation I'm not folding I just

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.890 
in this situation I'm not folding I just
don't<00:05:42.759> think<00:05:42.940> there's<00:05:43.060> any<00:05:43.210> way<00:05:43.389> we<00:05:43.539> can<00:05:43.690> give

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
don't think there's any way we can give

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.719 
don't think there's any way we can give
him<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.380> level<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.860> respect<00:05:45.250> for<00:05:45.490> only

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
him that level of respect for only

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.629 
him that level of respect for only
having<00:05:46.120> boats<00:05:46.539> and<00:05:47.349> yeah<00:05:48.159> there's<00:05:48.460> three

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
having boats and yeah there's three

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.520 
having boats and yeah there's three
combos<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.180> pocket<00:05:49.599> queens<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.259> that's<00:05:50.380> all

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
combos of pocket queens and that's all

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.779 
combos of pocket queens and that's all
well<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:50.830> good<00:05:50.919> but<00:05:51.310> by<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.520> same<00:05:51.729> token

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
well and good but by the same token

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.610 
well and good but by the same token
there<00:05:52.389> are<00:05:52.479> three<00:05:52.750> combos<00:05:53.110> of<00:05:53.199> pocket<00:05:53.500> aces

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
there are three combos of pocket aces

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.640 
there are three combos of pocket aces
there<00:05:54.219> are<00:05:54.370> six<00:05:54.699> combos<00:05:55.120> of<00:05:55.150> pocket<00:05:55.539> kings<00:05:55.780> he

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
there are six combos of pocket kings he

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.459 
there are six combos of pocket kings he
may<00:05:56.889> view<00:05:57.430> your<00:05:57.490> weird<00:05:58.360> roughly<00:05:58.930> third<00:05:59.199> pot

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
may view your weird roughly third pot

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.040 
may view your weird roughly third pot
size<00:05:59.710> bent<00:05:59.979> on<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.400> river<00:06:00.639> as<00:06:01.030> being<00:06:01.419> weak<00:06:01.659> and

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
size bent on the river as being weak and

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.409 
size bent on the river as being weak and
maybe<00:06:02.259> he<00:06:02.440> thinks<00:06:02.680> he<00:06:02.770> can<00:06:02.919> do<00:06:03.039> this<00:06:03.419> just

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
maybe he thinks he can do this just

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.600 
maybe he thinks he can do this just
ultimately<00:06:04.690> I<00:06:05.110> can't<00:06:05.440> only<00:06:05.710> give<00:06:06.039> him<00:06:06.219> credit

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
ultimately I can't only give him credit

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.820 
ultimately I can't only give him credit
for<00:06:06.639> having<00:06:07.180> hands<00:06:07.659> that'd<00:06:07.840> be<00:06:07.990> me<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.409> in

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
for having hands that'd be me and in

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.260 
for having hands that'd be me and in
this<00:06:08.949> situation<00:06:09.130> I<00:06:09.550> just<00:06:09.580> don't<00:06:09.940> see<00:06:10.150> myself

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
this situation I just don't see myself

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.480 
this situation I just don't see myself
finding<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.139> fold<00:06:11.380> against<00:06:11.770> this<00:06:12.069> kind<00:06:12.340> of

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
finding the fold against this kind of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.240 
finding the fold against this kind of
opponent<00:06:12.960> given<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.050> math<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.469> think<00:06:14.500> I'm<00:06:14.949> good

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
opponent given the math I think I'm good

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.189 
opponent given the math I think I'm good
here<00:06:15.550> enough<00:06:16.000> for<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.210> time<00:06:16.479> for<00:06:16.750> sure<00:06:17.020> to

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
here enough for the time for sure to

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.260 
here enough for the time for sure to
justify<00:06:17.680> making<00:06:18.039> this<00:06:18.159> call<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:18.849> I<00:06:18.940> think<00:06:19.150> the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
justify making this call and I think the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.089 
justify making this call and I think the
fold<00:06:19.569> is<00:06:19.810> a<00:06:19.840> little<00:06:20.440> bit<00:06:20.590> on<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.860> tight<00:06:21.039> side

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
fold is a little bit on the tight side

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.390 
fold is a little bit on the tight side
of<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.580> spectrum<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:22.270> say<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.080> least<00:06:23.289> so<00:06:23.740> Matt
