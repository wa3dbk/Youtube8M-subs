 today more people are addicted 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 very close to this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.680
 For example, our compatriot Larisa Mikhailovna 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 I like doing this I already do 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 It turns out at the exit when I start a new one 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.510
 tree or some new color 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.080
 don't exactly know what happens 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.720
 for gifts for decoration and have 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.369
 Trees are made of natural stone, 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 natural stone is bathing their beads 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.960
 unravel u and it turns out like this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.369

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.750
 brings ultimate luck and the main thing is that 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.959
 you get great pleasure from it 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.940
 This is the most important thing this master is able to 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.289
 create bead really 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.780
 amazing creations 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.909
 among the works and can be found as completely 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.489
 simple crafts and unusual 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.369
 decorations or realistic flowers and 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.170
 Larissa Mikhailovna's magnificent trees 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.569
 each work perfectly picks 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.360
 material and combines different techniques 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.760
 weaving beads thanks to this even 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.340
 simple figures turn into the present 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.800
 a work of art and in fact this is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 where the little did not specifically study 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.590
 a hobby turned into love and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.400
 zeal in real mastery I am nowhere 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.900
 did not study 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.410
 I just wanted to here and so and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.239

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.280

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.940

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.110
 making bead jewelery 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.610

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.700
