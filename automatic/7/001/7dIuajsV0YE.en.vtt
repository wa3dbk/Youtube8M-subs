the color guard etc etc but the you know
the<00:00:54.690> 2013<00:00:55.289> model<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.680> essentially<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.520> same

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the 2013 model is essentially the same

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.619 
the 2013 model is essentially the same
as<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.390> 2010<00:00:57.780> model<00:00:57.930> wise<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.590> 450<00:00:59.039> F

reverse cylinder etcetera etcetera so
it's<00:01:06.630> been<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:06.930> interesting<00:01:07.290> um<00:01:07.760> some<00:01:08.760> big

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's been really interesting um some big

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
philosophy really centralizing the mass
of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> bike<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> feel<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> lot

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
of the bike to make it feel a lot

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
of the bike to make it feel a lot
lighter<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> scales<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.259> little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
lighter we put it on the scales a little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.050 
lighter we put it on the scales a little
earlier<00:01:34.920> today<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> was<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.610> half<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.909> kilo

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
earlier today it was only half a kilo

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
earlier today it was only half a kilo
lighter<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:37.350> been<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.890> interesting

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
a lot of laps on the bikes that gave us

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
a lot of laps on the bikes that gave us
a<00:01:53.939> real<00:01:54.210> insight<00:01:54.720> into<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> personalities<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
lot of up and down hills so there's a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
lot of up and down hills so there's a
real<00:01:57.719> good<00:01:57.810> feel<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.020> chassis<00:01:58.770> braking

engine etc and because really you've got
to<00:02:01.890> test<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> bike<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> different<00:02:02.729> terrain

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to test the bike a different terrain

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850 
to test the bike a different terrain
we've<00:02:03.420> come<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.320> sound<00:02:04.590> track<00:02:04.770> at

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
we've come out here to a sound track at

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.249 
we've come out here to a sound track at
a<00:02:04.920> mate's<00:02:05.100> place<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.049> feel

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a mate's place you know to really feel

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.449 
a mate's place you know to really feel
the<00:02:07.409> sort<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.619> torque<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> engine<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.399> how

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the sort of torque of the engine and how

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.490 
the sort of torque of the engine and how
the<00:02:08.520> chassis<00:02:08.929> behaves<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.110> completely

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the chassis behaves in completely

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.580 
the chassis behaves in completely
different<00:02:10.770> terrain

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
different terrain

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.650 
different terrain
so<00:02:12.489> that's<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.849> side<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> equation<00:02:13.209> this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
so that's that side of the equation this

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.470 
so that's that side of the equation this
is<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.989> create<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.430> big<00:02:15.430> big<00:02:15.819> feature

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
is going to create a big big feature

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.670 
is going to create a big big feature
which<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.989> be<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> October

the world so again the idea once we were
done<00:02:40.420> testing<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.930> two<00:02:41.110> Yamahas

then the huge improvements on the new

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.280 
then the huge improvements on the new
bike<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:50.180> way<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.510> front<00:03:50.780> sticks<00:03:51.080> in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
bike just the way the front sticks in

bike just the way the front sticks in
and<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.830> steers<00:03:52.760> like<00:03:52.940> when<00:03:53.120> you're<00:03:53.240> breaking

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
and and steers like when you're breaking

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.090 
and and steers like when you're breaking
into<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.780> corner<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.650> get<00:03:54.770> off<00:03:54.920> the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
into a corner in it and you get off the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.620 
into a corner in it and you get off the
brakes<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.880> get<00:03:55.970> off<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.210> brakes<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.510> lot

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
brakes you can get off the brakes a lot

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.030 
brakes you can get off the brakes a lot
earlier<00:03:56.960> and<00:03:57.080> just<00:03:57.110> steer<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.800> have<00:03:57.890> no

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
earlier and just steer it in you have no

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.640 
earlier and just steer it in you have no
dramas<00:03:58.460> to<00:03:58.550> push<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> front<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.690> it<00:04:00.470> just

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
dramas to push on the front and it just

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.170 
dramas to push on the front and it just
feels<00:04:00.770> a<00:04:00.950> lot<00:04:01.070> more<00:04:01.250> stable<00:04:01.460> in<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.820> corners

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
feels a lot more stable in the corners

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.920 
feels a lot more stable in the corners
and<00:04:02.360> an<00:04:03.050> easier<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.560> ride<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.760> 14<00:04:05.270> motor

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
and an easier to ride the 14 motor

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.160 
and an easier to ride the 14 motor
I<00:04:06.170> felt<00:04:06.830> compared<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.400> 13<00:04:07.610> just<00:04:08.330> seems<00:04:08.960> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
I felt compared to the 13 just seems to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.950 
I felt compared to the 13 just seems to
be<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:09.860> really<00:04:10.040> smooth<00:04:10.520> motor<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.180> really

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
be just a really smooth motor and really

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.670 
be just a really smooth motor and really
usable<00:04:12.320> power

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
usable power

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.500 
usable power
well<00:04:12.950> we'll<00:04:13.400> test<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.730> on<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.420> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
well we'll test it on the on the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.660 
well we'll test it on the on the
hard-packed<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:15.080> just<00:04:15.260> found<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.590> -<00:04:15.740> really

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
hard-packed I just found it - really

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.170 
hard-packed I just found it - really
really<00:04:17.570> controllable<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> throttle<00:04:18.709> just

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
really controllable the throttle just

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.340 
really controllable the throttle just
gives<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.360> best<00:04:20.540> response<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.200> back

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
gives you the best response to the back

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.640 
gives you the best response to the back
wheel<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.820> me<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.270> was<00:04:23.420> a<00:04:23.450> big<00:04:24.320> winner<00:04:24.560> for

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
wheel so to me that was a big winner for

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.090 
wheel so to me that was a big winner for
the<00:04:24.950> for<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.370> new<00:04:25.490> bike<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.800> induction<00:04:27.800> noise

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the for the new bike and induction noise

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.940 
the for the new bike and induction noise
is<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.360> about<00:04:29.480> gone<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:29.800> yeah<00:04:30.800> it's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
is that just about gone so yeah it's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.920 
is that just about gone so yeah it's
quite<00:04:31.220> quite<00:04:32.090> interesting<00:04:32.210> when<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.720> ride

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
quite quite interesting when you ride

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.580 
quite quite interesting when you ride
the<00:04:32.960> two<00:04:33.170> back<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.470> back<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.980> 14<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:35.240> me<00:04:35.560> he's<00:04:36.560> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
the two back to back the 14 to me he's a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.920 
the two back to back the 14 to me he's a
much<00:04:36.860> better<00:04:36.890> bike<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.520> found<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.540> biggest

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
much better bike I found the biggest

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.050 
much better bike I found the biggest
difference<00:04:39.320> between<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.770> 2013<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.670> 2014

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
difference between the 2013 and 2014

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.320 
difference between the 2013 and 2014
bike<00:04:41.480> he's<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:42.530> know<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.770> handling<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.550> how

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
bike he's you know the handling the how

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.970 
bike he's you know the handling the how
it<00:04:44.480> feels<00:04:44.720> between<00:04:45.020> your<00:04:45.140> legs<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.440> know<00:04:45.590> it's

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
it feels between your legs you know it's

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.490 
it feels between your legs you know it's
a<00:04:46.100> lot<00:04:46.280> more<00:04:46.460> nimble<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.660> found<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.110> turns

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
a lot more nimble and I found it turns

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.440 
a lot more nimble and I found it turns
really<00:04:48.680> well<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.460> feels<00:04:49.670> really<00:04:50.030> nice<00:04:50.240> to

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
really well and it feels really nice to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.770 
really well and it feels really nice to
sit<00:04:50.630> on<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.680> know<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.830> find<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.460> can<00:04:52.780> flip

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
sit on and you know I find I can flip

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.150 
sit on and you know I find I can flip
flopper<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.320> throw<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.560> around<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.860> lot<00:04:54.980> more

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
flopper and throw it around a lot more

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.520 
flopper and throw it around a lot more
so<00:04:55.520> that's<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.360> biggest<00:04:56.810> point<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.290> me<00:04:57.380> is

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
so that's the biggest point for me is

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.830 
so that's the biggest point for me is
just<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.100> know<00:04:58.190> how<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.790> bike<00:04:59.000> feels<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.570> and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
just you know how the bike feels and and

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.980 
just you know how the bike feels and and
I<00:05:00.260> think<00:05:00.560> it's<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.740> step<00:05:00.950> forward
