00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello I am eugenia and today I show you how 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.680
 make a fun park for this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.930
 we need a cardboard and a paper this 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.330
 paper will cover the cardboard then it 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.330
 I'm going to give a wrinkle texture 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 and he hit it from behind with tape 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.720
 [Applause] 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.910
 once I have it stuck I give it 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.579
 back and this is going to be the grass of 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.280
 our amusement park to do 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.559
 the games we need paper ribbons 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 that we are going to cut previously with 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.420
 help from an adult and we're going to paste 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.970
 in different ways putting a little bit of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.580
 vinyl tail at the end we can 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.430
 start doing a circle hitting like this 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.890
 It can also be modified with folds 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.670
 a square I can do it by folding two 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.100
 tipitas I can also make a loop of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.220
 the roller coaster I put vinyl tail in 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.650
 one end I stick to the paper I make a curl 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.450
 or two as much as I want my roller coaster 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.240
 you can also have some ups and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.970
 down with this I'm going to make a slide 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.400
 or I can also do stairs can be 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.200
 fold for one side then took the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.210
 paper to the other side and I turn it to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.390
 I'll double up here 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.830
 I have some forms that I was doing 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.030
 previously what we are going to do now 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.399
 are some details finally we are going to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.860
 put a welcome sign to the park 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.780
 the park is ready now you can 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.840
 start playing what we did was 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.090
 first take a cardboard one way 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.070
 rectangular we cover it with a paper 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.070
 previously wrinkled 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.890
 We take strips of paper that we cut with 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 the help of an adult and we join them 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.050
 different ways we finally did 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.630
 details with a marker and we place a 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.709
 welcome poster 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.709
