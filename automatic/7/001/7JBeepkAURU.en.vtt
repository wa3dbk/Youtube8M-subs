00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
into the habit of doing these like every

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
regular basis so I never see how that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.730 
regular basis so I never see how that
goes<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:40.660> one<00:02:40.840> thing<00:02:40.990> that<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.260> want<00:02:41.650> to
