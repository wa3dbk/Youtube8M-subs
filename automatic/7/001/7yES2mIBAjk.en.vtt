00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.290
 watch the channel and sockets and we on 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 mobile congress barcelona 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.780
 here the nvidia company brought the tablet 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 tiger laptop key 1 is a prototype outwardly he 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.949
 a bit like regular granule 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.260
 which is left but their insides are strong 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.480
 different in the tablet is installed chip 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 tegra key 1 with mobile architecture 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.949
 Kepler and this is one hundred and ninety two cores and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 full jack &amp; gets you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.840
 It is made by 28 nano meter 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.759
 process in this little 7 inch 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 the tablet are incredible power 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 able to issue such graphics this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 The program is developed and nvidia 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.950
 Realistic called render.ru 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.290
 guys made a 3d room that is well 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
 Such graphics look very lively 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.579
 now there is no mobile games infinity 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 blade 3 is no match 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 and real racing 3 nervously smokes on the sidelines 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.780
 on this capable new chip kei 1 which 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.879
 will work either on two denwer cores 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 with a frequency of 2 GHz and 5 and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.399
 either at 4 but with a frequency of 2 and 3 GHz but all 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 Equal room is not the most interesting 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.030
 a year ago and nvidia showed 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 realistic graphics on the face 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.070
 the person just showed it on p. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.229
 and now it is finalized and ported to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.659
 mobile tiger kay 1 you only 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 Imagine how much power the chip has 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.820
 supports de rede x 11 about angel and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.619
 tessellation it works without difficulty with 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.400
 unreal engine 4 engine 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.310
 tiger key 1 is not even the xbox 360 level 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.799
 and ps3 is a little better and still fits 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 everything in the palm of your hand is naturally key 1 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 supports ultra hd resolution 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.400
 I can not convey all those feelings that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 pursuing live communication st players one 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.259
 but you can believe we are waiting for a great 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.360
 being not only in building games but also 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 in all mobile related areas 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 graphics by the way on the tablet was 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 installed 1d we 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.729
 a game with pseudo 3d graphics called it 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 three 2 game is similar to Alice in the country 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.340
 miracles but this is not the most yes 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.899
 the main thing is how volumetric and beautifully looks 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.170
 similar on the screen of a mobile device 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.420
 in general, I am delighted without a doubt on this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.250
 our journey through mvc ends 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.250
