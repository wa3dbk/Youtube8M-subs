00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello you love I have one again 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 cinema force update video for you and me 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.840
 I know it's a bit longer 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.509
 since the last update video came 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 but it was just that I did not like that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 really has accumulated a lot because 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 I either have a tutorial about it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 and then I find that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 superfluous that twice in the camera too 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 hold 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.150
 yes or I just did not come so often 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 simulate or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.619
 yes, when orders were due I have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 unfortunately they often forget that too 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 result then to photograph or to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 film that is an order I have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 happened to think of it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.879
 Turn on the camera briefly 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.800
 and so that you cover octopus 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.730
 octopus earrings and I wanted 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 just a little something different 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 Try as they may know 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.219
 her that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.629
 i'll say standard octopus 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.280
 studs maybe you can do that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.809
 start something and then I have 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.000
 here are these little cats made 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 yes actually totally cute I wanted 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 always other so different 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.219
 make colors of cats I am 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 somehow never got to everyone 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.699
 case I found the very sweet then I have 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.860
 made a little damage and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 little teddy actually came just like that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.750
 In the end, this is glittering 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 tan 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.980
 drove very nice is actually quite 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.510
 nice and yes is a tiny little 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.950
 I thought that it was very sweet, I knew that 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.540
 not know what to do then have 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 I'll just hold this little one 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.500
 teddy and this is one 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.900
 little squirrel that's me too 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.460
 sweet and I really want that too 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.460
 Do it often and then maybe 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.930
 in my shop assortment with record 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.010
 yes, I think really cute 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 maybe you'll see that a bit 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.890
 unfortunately from the paint you have the one 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.330
 a few white spots have seen so good 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.090
 Of course , then does not come directly into the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.250
 pot but by the art I think that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.080
 simply means then I have some 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.369
 user made i do not know me 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.410
 somehow totally stand on such 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.950
 Charm bracelets I 'm the mega mega 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.390
 pretty and that's why I like that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.190
 also totally like it though 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.680
 very very expensive 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.899
 more complicated than chains for me 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.000
 I then with me this very many of 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.050
 make this little trailer and here 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.880
 I have such a small cafÃ© 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.470
 turtles a small cafe 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.570
 turtle bracelet made that ours 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.039
 already landed in my the wander shop 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.660
 and i think this bracelet is that 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.440
 just as cute with the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 marshmallows and yes as I said I have 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.620
 a bit in the local for a while 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.390
 The cinema and then I always have 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.910
 think about what could you do 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.130
 and yes, the Karawanken I had yes 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.810
 already done in tutorial and lies 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.209
 yes actually close that I also have one 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.070
 Charm bracelet with little duck make 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.830
 and I tried the chamber 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.480
 duckling not too small but also 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 not too big because I like it 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.400
 that somehow not so elements huge 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.360
 are on charm bracelets then I have 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.950
 also a 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.750
 Medium applied with the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.830
 result I am so satisfied I am here 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.570
 so much loves in it 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.920
 I could not decide forever 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.210
 If I should not keep it to myself 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 I have it now in the bowl 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.780
 packed and that it is with this 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.700
 the little bunny and the carrot me 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.340
 just think that's so nice 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.890
 and yes the mass of the bunny is 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.180
 but so easily transparent so that it 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.370
 the with masses and I think that fits 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.770
 here the customers just like me 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.290

 rice balls forum with different 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.500

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 I now have a bracelet 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.870
 hung and that's the happy says 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.820
 bracelet so to speak with many 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 funny positive faces and me 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.290
 I'm not so in love with the pedals 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.660
 hammer and still this perrin 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
 combinations but so i have to go there 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.130
 let's say I'm totally happy that I'm there 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.020
 so beautiful we are found 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.580
 So I am very happy with and 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.380
 this is the charm bracelet 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.239
 Number 2 which then emerged from it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.670
 and that is more like that in the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.470
 apps so these silly faces as we do today 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.570
 form 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.180
 I could catch the faces 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.430
 totally funny and personally awake 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.280
 how to bring me up to laugh 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.600
 and fitting because I already have something 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.970
 to make them I also have a time 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.440
 small not sushi a bigger one 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.660
 Polar bears are made and two this year 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.790
 Rockabilly style can be said that way 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.830
 a bit pin up moderately with these 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.100
 Score with this tied loop 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.450
 and also below that the kelp has too 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.890
 already spotted the pattern I found 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.510
 Somehow quite funny and I wanted to 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.390
 Try and I'll have it 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.770
 sewn a loop myself and have 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.930
 then hung so few days off 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.460
 and i think this is a pendant 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.830
 this is really a very nice placement 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.890
 idea and then I have some of 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.360
 i made these kite industries 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.580
 I think because not all 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.230
 filmed and not all photographed 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.690
 For one, I have a lot of these 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.880
 The standard chains also made this possible 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.250
 gives to my shop and so this 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.440
 standard always in the shop there and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.180
 then have inspired by it too 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.860
 Some people do such a farm now 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.080
 but already sold 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.610
 and here i have made an industry 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.770
 that looks completely the same way 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.660
 he breathes that just as posh 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.310
 is and the industry is already 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.470
 could have gone to a dear person 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.140
 you can win on mine 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.340
 facebook page so in combination with 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.490
 a contest by dr 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.720
 mona and yes, here's another one 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.699
 few other colors 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.050
 you can certainly at any time 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.760
 if you somehow ins 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.320
 individual wishes have just arrived 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.479
 There are so many dragon chains 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.340
 Variants where you can let off steam then 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.660
 in the color alone if only the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.000
 color changes does it make a 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.220
 huge amount and looks simple 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.729
 every time different and yes I think that 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.410
 kites are just totally cute i fight 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.240
 also the kombis are beery desired 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.080
 have the customers of mine 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.060
 have desired 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.979
 yes I was totally happy so that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.900
 was super fun this 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.669
 dragon here for example the color 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.680
 we come with this red orange gold 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.630
 It's just awesome so I have to 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.330
 necessarily make times by default 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.000
 and yes I'm almost annoying the dawanda 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.560
 so extremely expensive than salesman otherwise 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.139
 I would also do more from home 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.210
 but yes as I said falls 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.130
 Wish to stick again and mine 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.510
 differ from standard products 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.700
 can you really help me anytime 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.830
 write and I can do it very much 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.320
 like for you and put this here 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.820
 I also thought that was great and me 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.590
 personally this has a lot of steam punk 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.450
 remember and I believe I will 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.720
 also once again at 1 small steampunk 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.660
 make dragon out of it 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.450
 I have to look 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.870
 that was so not so old that 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.460
 order and yes as I said very much 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.920
 inspired I'm excited 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.060
 extent in the direction of steampunk 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.200
 because I am in the direction 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.560
 actually not really 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.180
 have dared about the cinema then something 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 slow and actually similar 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.200
 and it was mine 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.900

 Bunny on it Yes I think I have one 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.590
 learned a lot about usb sticks 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.800
 and in the meantime something works like that 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.330
 better than before yes I'll say 12 years 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.220
 through the first time 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.900

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.570
 a product is what i somehow yes 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.250

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.360
 I'm just really proud of it 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.760
 I just wanted to show you that 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.490
