that that wasn't really being done at

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.170 
that that wasn't really being done at
the<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> mean<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.140> common

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the time I mean now it was common

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.030 
the time I mean now it was common
does<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:32.570> but<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:32.960> was<00:01:33.110> doing<00:01:33.410> like<00:01:33.680> colored

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
does it now but I was doing like colored

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.150 
does it now but I was doing like colored
lights<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:35.440> objects<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.530> shouldn't<00:01:36.890> be<00:01:36.980> that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
lights on objects that shouldn't be that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.100 
lights on objects that shouldn't be that
color<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.730> that's<00:01:38.300> what<00:01:38.450> got<00:01:38.540> me<00:01:38.600> noticed<00:01:38.840> it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
color and that's what got me noticed it

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.590 
color and that's what got me noticed it
was<00:01:39.230> that<00:01:39.320> visual<00:01:39.770> style<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:40.850> kind<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.510> think

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
was that visual style so I kind of think

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.330 
was that visual style so I kind of think
I<00:01:41.720> bring<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.020> visual<00:01:42.500> start<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.800> all<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.130> trucks

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
I bring a visual start to all the trucks

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.850 
I bring a visual start to all the trucks
I<00:01:43.460> make<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.260> that's<00:01:45.260> kind<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.530> what<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.680> go

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
I make now so that's kind of what I go

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.850 
I make now so that's kind of what I go
for<00:01:46.100> anyway<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.000> Eureka<00:01:47.630> moment<00:01:47.660> truck<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
for anyway the Eureka moment truck the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.420 
for anyway the Eureka moment truck the
11<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.460> worked<00:01:49.700> on<00:01:49.880> was<00:01:50.000> probably

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
11 that I worked on was probably

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.890 
11 that I worked on was probably
archipelago<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.030> floating<00:01:53.390> islands

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
archipelago it's the floating islands

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.620 
archipelago it's the floating islands
track<00:01:54.200> with<00:01:54.560> waterfalls<00:01:55.070> coming<00:01:55.970> often<00:01:56.240> that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
track with waterfalls coming often that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.880 
track with waterfalls coming often that
was<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> moment<00:01:57.020> when<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.290> made<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.530> track

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
was the moment when I made that track

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460 
was the moment when I made that track
and<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.280> thought<00:01:58.369> yeah<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.050> cool<00:02:00.229> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
and I just thought yeah this is cool I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.800 
and I just thought yeah this is cool I
could<00:02:01.190> see<00:02:01.430> something<00:02:01.460> different<00:02:01.970> that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
could see something different that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.109 
could see something different that
wasn't<00:02:03.110> trials<00:02:03.380> HD<00:02:03.530> inside<00:02:04.040> warehouses<00:02:04.640> that

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
wasn't trials HD inside warehouses that

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.430 
wasn't trials HD inside warehouses that
was<00:02:05.360> probably<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.690> one<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.050> most<00:02:06.170> proud

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
was probably the one that was most proud

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.499 
was probably the one that was most proud
of<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.430> about<00:02:07.550> those<00:02:07.790> satisfying

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
of and what about those satisfying

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.660 
of and what about those satisfying
shortcuts<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.709> kind<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:09.979> intentionally<00:02:10.520> put

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
shortcuts you kind of intentionally put

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.190 
shortcuts you kind of intentionally put
a<00:02:10.700> few<00:02:10.910> shortcuts<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.540> there<00:02:11.780> even<00:02:11.959> though<00:02:12.140> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
a few shortcuts in there even though you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500 
a few shortcuts in there even though you
can't<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> kind<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.459> thing<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> perfect

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
can't do a kind of thing on the perfect

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750 
can't do a kind of thing on the perfect
running<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.290> million<00:02:15.610> somebody<00:02:16.610> could

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
running one in a million somebody could

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.580 
running one in a million somebody could
do<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.420> put<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.989> little<00:02:18.140> helper

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
do that so you put that little helper

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
do that so you put that little helper
there<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.220> case<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.690> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
there just in case then when you see a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.840 
there just in case then when you see a
replay<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.140> someone<00:02:21.470> doing<00:02:21.620> anything<00:02:21.950> yes<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
replay of someone doing anything yes it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.970 
replay of someone doing anything yes it
would<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.330> can't<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.020> but<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.410> come<00:02:24.770> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
would I can't do it but they come and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860 
would I can't do it but they come and
that's<00:02:25.100> all<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.280> takes<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.420> you're<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.780> an

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that's all it takes so you're not an

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.470 
that's all it takes so you're not an
expert<00:02:27.230> then<00:02:27.470> I'm<00:02:28.040> okay<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.880> can<00:02:29.150> pass<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
expert then I'm okay I can pass the
