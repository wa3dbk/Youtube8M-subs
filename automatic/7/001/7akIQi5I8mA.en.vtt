the<00:00:00.690> back<00:00:00.840> plate<00:00:01.079> on<00:00:01.260> it<00:00:01.500> pops<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.610> it's<00:00:03.090> a

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
the back plate on it pops in it's a

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.970 
the back plate on it pops in it's a
little<00:00:03.270> wobbly<00:00:03.750> but<00:00:04.049> once<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.770> get<00:00:04.859> two

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
little wobbly but once you get two

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.789 
little wobbly but once you get two
screws<00:00:05.220> in<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.460> fits<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.210> pretty<00:00:06.330> good<00:00:06.799> so

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
screws in it fits in pretty good so

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:19.540 
screws in it fits in pretty good so
we're<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.610> take<00:00:09.150> your<00:00:09.269> screw<00:00:18.320> um

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
we're going to do is take your screw um

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550 
we're going to do is take your screw um
you<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> picture<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.930> eventually<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you get the picture just eventually you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:45.900 
you get the picture just eventually you
just<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.100> four<00:00:23.369> in

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.319 

well<00:00:46.910> I'm<00:00:46.970> going<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.180> speed<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.390> up<00:00:49.180> so<00:00:50.180> after

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
well I'm going to speed this up so after

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.689 
well I'm going to speed this up so after
you<00:00:50.629> screw<00:00:51.470> in<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.860> screws<00:00:52.430> into<00:00:52.610> the

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
you screw in the screws into the

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.579 
you screw in the screws into the
motherboard<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:53.900> have<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.199> motherboard

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
motherboard and you have the motherboard

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.210 
motherboard and you have the motherboard
and<00:00:54.820> everything<00:00:55.820> else<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.150> done<00:00:56.920> as<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.129> can

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
and everything else is done as you can

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.570 
and everything else is done as you can
see<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.760> Scoob<00:00:59.030> pops<00:00:59.360> out<00:00:59.690> a<00:01:00.019> little<00:01:00.949> bit<00:01:01.129> from

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
see the Scoob pops out a little bit from

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.509 
see the Scoob pops out a little bit from
the<00:01:02.000> actual<00:01:02.390> cooler<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.290> then<00:01:04.250> from<00:01:04.460> there

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the actual cooler and then from there

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.249 
the actual cooler and then from there
you<00:01:05.030> take<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> other<00:01:05.390> screws<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.080> get

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
you take the other screws that you get

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.420 
you take the other screws that you get
these<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.740> you're<00:01:09.830> just<00:01:09.979> going<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.220> put<00:01:10.399> that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
these and you're just going to put that

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.060 
these and you're just going to put that
on<00:01:10.729> top<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.080> can<00:01:12.350> screw<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:12.800> with<00:01:12.950> your

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
on top you can screw it in with your

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.380 
on top you can screw it in with your
hand<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:13.550> right<00:01:13.789> at<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.030> end<00:01:14.149> you're<00:01:14.270> going

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
hand but right at the end you're going

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.050 
hand but right at the end you're going
to<00:01:14.479> need<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:15.700> flathead<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:18.280> now<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:19.460> get<00:01:19.880> that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
to need a flathead to now just get that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.639 
to need a flathead to now just get that
extra<00:01:20.330> tightness<00:01:20.899> right<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.530> end

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
extra tightness right in that the end

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.460 
extra tightness right in that the end
and<00:01:22.180> after<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.539> pretty<00:01:23.750> much<00:01:23.840> done<00:01:24.229> just

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
and after that you pretty much done just

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.499 
and after that you pretty much done just
make<00:01:24.649> sure<00:01:24.800> it's<00:01:24.979> nice<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.270> snogging<00:01:26.270> it

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
make sure it's nice and snogging it

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.919 
make sure it's nice and snogging it
doesn't<00:01:26.930> move<00:01:27.020> around<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.600> these<00:01:32.750> are<00:01:32.899> the

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
doesn't move around so these are the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.529 
doesn't move around so these are the
temperatures<00:01:33.530> I'm<00:01:33.830> getting<00:01:34.179> ignore<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.300> max

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
temperatures I'm getting ignore the max

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.660 
temperatures I'm getting ignore the max
that<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:36.140> was<00:01:36.440> having<00:01:36.679> a<00:01:36.740> problem<00:01:36.920> for<00:01:37.490> but

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
that I was having a problem for but

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.850 
that I was having a problem for but
that's<00:01:38.360> just<00:01:38.600> something<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.050> messed<00:01:39.289> up<00:01:39.440> on<00:01:39.619> but

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
that's just something I messed up on but

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.149 
that's just something I messed up on but
um<00:01:40.720> years<00:01:41.720> ago

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 

obviously<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.749> of<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:46.020> load<00:01:46.200> on

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
obviously there's not much of a load on

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.749 
obviously there's not much of a load on
the<00:01:46.439> CPU<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.249> but<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
the CPU right now but and for all you

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
the CPU right now but and for all you
Celsius<00:01:50.759> fans<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.359> I<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.530> want<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Celsius fans out there I don't want to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.819 
Celsius fans out there I don't want to
see<00:01:52.859> Fahrenheit<00:01:53.929> around<00:01:54.929> 80<00:01:55.350> degrees<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:56.369> like

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
see Fahrenheit around 80 degrees is like

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.779 
see Fahrenheit around 80 degrees is like
right<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.090> I'm<00:02:00.209> about<00:02:00.390> getting<00:02:01.789> so

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
right here is what I'm about getting so

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.770 
right here is what I'm about getting so
26<00:02:03.479> 234<00:02:04.109> Celsius
