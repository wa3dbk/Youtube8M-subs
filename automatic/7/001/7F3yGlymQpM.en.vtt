quick turn and under one roof we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
quick turn and under one roof we
designed<00:00:42.239> our<00:00:42.329> design<00:00:42.629> process<00:00:42.660> essentially

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
designed our design process essentially

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.510 
designed our design process essentially
around<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> fact<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.829> how<00:00:46.829> styling

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
around the fact that we can how styling

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
around the fact that we can how styling
and<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:48.180> aerodynamics<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> same<00:00:49.500> time

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and have aerodynamics at the same time

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.990 
and have aerodynamics at the same time
and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.610> they're<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:50.730> many

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and I don't think they're very many

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.389 
and I don't think they're very many
places<00:00:51.270> where<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.289> place<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.890> could<00:00:53.280> do

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
places where in one place you could do

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.130 
places where in one place you could do
the<00:00:53.550> design<00:00:53.910> engineering<00:00:54.480> test<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the design engineering test and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
the design engineering test and
development<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.539> high-performance

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
development and get a high-performance

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
development and get a high-performance
vehicle<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.670> that
