00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.260
 Ask why we fight 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 It is like asking why leaves fall. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.300
 It's our nature. 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.300
 But maybe there's a better question. 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 Why are we fighting? 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.100
 To protect home and family, 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.000
 to balance 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 and brought harmony. 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.460
 For my kind, the real question is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.160
 what it is worth fighting for. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Wrent translation and timing.
