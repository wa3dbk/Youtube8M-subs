00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 but let's see another big one this this 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.870
 It was much more elegant than much more 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 talent 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.910
 valerón that are still active is that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 is still active and we are going to see him 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 valero have asked us many fans 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.700
 many of them canaries not everything for 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.500
 the posts that he started in the long 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 inegi that is the city of david silva 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
 This is also his first stage in the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 palms started in the palms b came to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.600
 the palms that is this stage and then already 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.340
 we're going to see her in the biggest you appreciate her 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 cloth in a football player one of a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.579
 intelligence and extreme skill 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 Mythical by cold day is also true 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.309
 I would not put frank carlos on 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.510
 insular with the irons of that is yes 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 is a player who has the virtue of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 stop the time that when things are 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.960
 complicate in the area of ​​con it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 Find the time and the moment look 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 not just the play the pass to the player who 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.059
 that nobody has seen the different player 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
 central colors pure talent is not what 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.050
 that was always this way, look no one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.050
 You have seen this line of the pass 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 never 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:14.790
 in the world I 've always liked the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.160
 players who let others run 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 because they do not need no and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.110
 I admire footballers who do not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.180
 they need the speed to stand out 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.710
 because in that way the player who 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.670
 act in that way you need much more 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.770
 talent 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 however I must confess that it is good 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 valerón 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.480
 maybe it could have come a bit that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480
 neither 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.470
 this season it seems to me and the second is 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.390
 the descent in remembering us then 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 notice that that control and everything in it for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.000
 the relative in the forum legality does not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 good for none of that template 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.210
 very strange things happened to him that he has 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.210
 booty stuff took away the post 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.750
 this shirt is entering a 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 Interview with which large Hasselbaink 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.729
 very big but I'm pretty goals to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.729
 atleti in that league I do not know if like 80 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.950
 in the bernabéu 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.230
 in sport entertained he made some 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.819
 seasons is part of the big one for the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.569
 of the great superpower that this is a 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.620
 Munich party we must remember the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.160
 exaggerated carlos saying he has 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 bochini things 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.790
 a player a false slow in the sense 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 that in the end you run the ball and 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 it's not exactly yes because always 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.560
 what I believe is a 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.650
 mistake when you see that a player 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.330
 does not have physical speed qualify it from 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.740
 slow but the speed as well has 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.990
 said soccer 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.660
 mental the same stationary that you pass 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.550
 al united a very serious injury break 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.800
 of the inner cruciate ligament that then 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.480
 a year stopped almost a year stopped 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.650
 then it relapsed again 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.330
 they should sing football because it goes on and on 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
 follow what has already marked his first double 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.709
 of his story with the palms has been 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.319
 commented magnificent by harassing the link 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.230
 of the attacker knicks and the guard link 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.180
 overflows to rivals and I'm 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.160
 announcing speaking sprint simply they 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.140
 cheat with the body of the centenariazo 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.750
 officials grace has commented a lot 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.370
 that he was a player in the national team 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.319
 current in the way of playing current 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.150
 the Spanish team that would fit in 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.470
 wonder and once they asked him in 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.270
 In addition to himself long ago Vicente del 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.980
 forest and we said that if on the computer 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.980
 current valerón would have would have room
