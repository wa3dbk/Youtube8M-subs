00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
areas on a wall that need touch-up maybe

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.570

you<00:01:36.170> banged<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.680> with<00:01:36.830> something<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.400> might

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
you banged it with something you might

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.969 
you banged it with something you might
try<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.270> weenie<00:01:38.570> roller<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.500> really<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.830> might

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
try a weenie roller but really you might

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.499 
try a weenie roller but really you might
just<00:01:40.130> need<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.369> reroll<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.030> whole<00:01:41.210> wall

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
just need to reroll the whole wall

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
because especially with dark colors it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.060 
because especially with dark colors it
can<00:01:44.270> flash<00:01:44.660> if<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:45.320> walk<00:01:45.560> up<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
can flash if you just walk up to it and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.710 
can flash if you just walk up to it and
go<00:01:46.190> like<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.060> middle<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.509> wall

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
go like that in the middle of the wall

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.450 
go like that in the middle of the wall
you<00:01:47.930> might<00:01:48.110> be<00:01:48.259> able<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:48.830> spot<00:01:49.160> even

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
you might be able to see that spot even

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.770 
you might be able to see that spot even
though<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> same<00:01:50.030> paint<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.570> same

color

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.290 
color
now<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.740> might<00:01:52.070> check<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.490> ceiling<00:01:53.030> if<00:01:53.210> you

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
now you might check the ceiling if you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.240 
now you might check the ceiling if you
bumped<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.840> anywhere<00:01:54.259> when<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.649> roll<00:01:55.009> in<00:01:55.130> the

bumped it anywhere when you roll in the
walls<00:01:55.460> now<00:01:55.910> it's<00:01:56.119> time<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.420> touch<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.110> up<00:02:02.080> now

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
walls now it's time to touch that up now

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.020 
walls now it's time to touch that up now
after<00:02:03.710> you've<00:02:03.950> done<00:02:04.130> your<00:02:04.190> touch-up<00:02:04.580> it's
