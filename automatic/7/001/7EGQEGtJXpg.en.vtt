00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
about the way well uh no I don't like I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.760 
about the way well uh no I don't like I
like<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.630> said<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.899> don't<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.289> try<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> teach

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
like I said I don't like to try to teach

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.139 
like I said I don't like to try to teach
hitting<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.280> he's<00:01:58.520> got<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.729> lot<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:58.909> power

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
hitting I know he's got a lot of power

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.539 
hitting I know he's got a lot of power
you<00:01:59.420> I<00:02:00.049> think<00:02:00.350> his<00:02:00.530> wrist<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.039> probably<00:02:01.399> when

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
you I think his wrist is probably when

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.859 
you I think his wrist is probably when
it<00:02:01.640> was<00:02:01.819> it<00:02:01.940> because<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.330> can<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.630> how<00:02:02.810> he

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
it was it because you can see how he

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:03.789 
it was it because you can see how he
swings<00:02:03.200> too<00:02:03.350> hard

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
swings too hard

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.249 
swings too hard
but<00:02:04.340> one<00:02:05.000> thing<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.360> forgot<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.899> say<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.229> I

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
but one thing I forgot to say that I

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.380 
but one thing I forgot to say that I
really<00:02:06.560> believe<00:02:06.890> in<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.000> keeping

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
really believe in and that is keeping

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.650 
really believe in and that is keeping
your<00:02:08.479> back<00:02:08.720> foot<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.819> one<00:02:10.819> place<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.390> don't<00:02:11.480> like

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
your back foot in one place I don't like

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.280 
your back foot in one place I don't like
to<00:02:11.870> see<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.019> hitter<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.799> guess<00:02:13.549> Stan<00:02:14.150> Musial<00:02:14.420> bit

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
to see a hitter I guess Stan Musial bit

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.170 
to see a hitter I guess Stan Musial bit
away<00:02:15.470> after<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.310> he<00:02:16.340> used<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.730> drag<00:02:16.910> his

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
away after a because he used to drag his

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.420 
away after a because he used to drag his
right<00:02:17.420> eye<00:02:17.450> let<00:02:17.810> his<00:02:18.049> back<00:02:18.290> foot<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
right eye let his back foot but if you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.390 
right eye let his back foot but if you
can<00:02:19.580> keep<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:20.000> back<00:02:20.209> foot<00:02:21.280> stationary<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
can keep that back foot stationary and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
can keep that back foot stationary and
when<00:02:22.579> you're<00:02:22.730> swinging<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.630> won't<00:02:23.810> move<00:02:23.959> your

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
when you're swinging you won't move your

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.720 
when you're swinging you won't move your
head<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.620> much<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.040> makes<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.340> ball<00:02:25.519> look

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
head so much and it makes the ball look

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.610 
head so much and it makes the ball look
a<00:02:25.850> lot<00:02:26.000> easier<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.420> hit<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.870> you're<00:02:27.260> moving

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
a lot easier to hit if you're moving

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.099 
a lot easier to hit if you're moving
your<00:02:27.739> head<00:02:27.890> at<00:02:28.190> all<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.359> motion<00:02:29.630> up<00:02:29.900> here

the whole plate covered if the balls

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.779 
the whole plate covered if the balls
inside<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:33.080> perfect<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:34.160> if<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.430> outside

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
inside it's perfect but if it's outside

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.820 
inside it's perfect but if it's outside
you<00:04:35.000> can<00:04:35.120> still<00:04:35.330> control<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.560> I'll<00:04:36.650> just

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
you can still control it so I'll just

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.969 
you can still control it so I'll just
try<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> couple<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.820> times

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.879 

perhaps<00:04:43.979> that<00:04:44.639> would<00:04:44.819> have<00:04:44.969> been<00:04:45.119> in<00:04:45.889> 1953

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
perhaps that would have been in 1953

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.939 
perhaps that would have been in 1953
automated<00:04:47.399> on<00:04:50.959> alright<00:04:51.959> it<00:04:52.109> was<00:04:52.289> -<00:04:52.469> that<00:04:52.919> was

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
automated on alright it was - that was

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.569 
automated on alright it was - that was
too<00:04:53.249> close<00:04:53.459> to<00:04:53.519> fry<00:04:53.879> that<00:04:57.859> was<00:04:58.859> a<00:04:58.889> perfect<00:04:59.309> want

00:04:59.569 --> 00:04:59.579 
too close to fry that was a perfect want

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:03.919 
too close to fry that was a perfect want
you<00:04:59.699> to<00:04:59.789> hit<00:04:59.909> that<00:05:00.919> okay
