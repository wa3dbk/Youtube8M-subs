00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.830
 This is Georgy. 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.569
 Georgy has a nice shop. There he renews second-hand computers and then resells them. 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:10.749
 But things look different in the back of the workshop. 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.249
 Georgy uses cheap labor, 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:18.710
 to install Microsoft's clandestine software on computers, 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.309
 who sells in his sleek shop and online. 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.060
 Sometimes they even take original certificates of authenticity from old ones 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 computers and place them on the second-hand computers, 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.350
 so customers can not find the difference. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.020
 This is Banjani, the footballer. Renewed second-hand computers are so profitable that they attract all kinds of customers. Even really rich and famous people like Banjin. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.080
 But when Banjin takes his computer home, he soon finds something wrong. 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.910
 Illegal software on his updated computer can not be updated and he loses all the photos with his famous friends. 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360
 When Banzini gets angry, he loses control ... and has a habit of grabbing the first, 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.130
 what's going on. 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.120
 Banzini has no stopping. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.160
 Many people, 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.550
 He is determined to avenge. 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 who update computers, 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.660
 and that means, 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.310
 that it's getting terrible around. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 Celebrities organize and take the law in their hand. 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.380
 We do not want to get out of Microsoft 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.290
 witnesses of such situations. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 That is why we are working with small and large companies, 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.570
 which update computers and offer the customer good products, 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.810
 which work. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.940
 This means, 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.600
 that we provide the customer with legal and authenticity certificates; 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 regardless of whether the re-used second-hand computers are sold in the main street store, 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.420
 by phone or online. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.520
 Microsoft does not resort to violence for the capture of criminals. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 If you are like Georgy, Microsoft will use the full power of the legal system, 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 to pursue any unlicensed activity. 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870
 The web is tightening. 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.590
 Make the right choice.
