00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.859
 jo so hello first so I wanted you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.929
 today only times I show how my setup 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.809
 you have at home , because I am also 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.500
 at the moment you have your own home cockpit 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.750
 build what you see here is just 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.070
 my self-built mcp on me 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.779
 wanted to enter today 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.789
 the whole thing is going on per 7 3 7 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 which also bought is great 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 happy with it and well maybe 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.600
 Already the buttons see the movies straight 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 but that's still possible 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.940
 otherwise the mcp should actually be so far 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 function 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.059
 that's all but one thing the other 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410
 still comes and that is nothing more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.399
 That's why we're showing up now 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 constructed here as the whole is the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.629
 camera the hand so here we all have 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.430
 buttons and display all seven segment 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 with switches and asics so or hintersee 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.310
 the franke wants from different forks 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 and so what i have to be there so nice 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.700
 Unfortunately I did not do it because like 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.080
 said homemade 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.430
 So try a little bit to show her 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 but there you do not see much 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.540
 I almost did not look myself 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.180
 more by a small look to the rear 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 also shows that everything is hidden again 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 have as we hid it but 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 As I said, everything is difficult now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.320
 recognizable 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 I have everything in front of it , too 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 to pack a box so that you can 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 Do not take this whole cable back 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.430
 looks 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.259
 how do i have the things here? 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.000
 connected and there are many 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.409
 but different 7 segment drivers 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.960
 A relatively expensive in my opinion 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.299
 and you can always only seven 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.310
 connect or something 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.320
 that would just be too expensive for me 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 That 's why I have with the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.509
 Arduino explained 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:23.410
 arduino and to be exact we see 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:26.260
 here back here without yes with only three in 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.310
 puts i only try to look at three 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.000
 Inputs provider now in plus or 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.630
 minus it arrives and three inputs are enough 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.790
 completely off at all seven segment 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 to control ads 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.410
 Here we have built one and even 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.630
 is something I call it which then 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.760
 in turn can drive seven segments 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.250
 I'll try here we have one 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 small self-built things, yes, like 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.780
 I can also tell you more about that 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.959
 say or give you tips or 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.420
 like if you would like it if 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.640
 is desired as said write me 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.500
 then just give or give leave 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.180
 comment I can then also like you 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 again to play a whole but 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 I think first the interest must 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.120
 only be awakened this reason 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.500
 so first that we get that far that me 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.500
 also like to demonstrate 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:41.910
 For that we open it once on the side 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.910
 Here I have the displays now open 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:54.160
 good now so once you have that all 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.840
 in the promotion displays the course 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.470
 now just temporarily 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.810
 Run this pc to demonstrate that 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.320
 then we go on our flight simulator 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:13.990
 pc where finally everything on it 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:17.640
 bmi runs so well then we open first 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.640
 happy are completely normal 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:38.380
 and then of course and open then too 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:41.530
 right roses mcp there you have to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.520
 actually already work so now 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.550
 I have already here 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.030
 Again, everything has been done 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:55.840
 on the side here too that it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.440
 works from here on to 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.330
 example on 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.840
 It shines everything I can here too 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.840
 turn off 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.590
 a little bit weird at the moment 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:22.430
 Always Sometimes if the initial order 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:25.550
 make now the thing but new here 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.150
 we also worked too 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.150
 everything is wonderful 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.730
 So we can pretty when I 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.800
 every turn is like here also one 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:42.430
 have a rash and a display that 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.020
 everything works so well 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.650
 of course we have the here too 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.390
 display 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:57.850
 we turn then have the same indication 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:06:01.940
 here as well as it can look us 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:08.630
 what else does not like us because 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:13.600
 Get out of here and do that here 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.600
 season so far a room has not 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:23.270
 I am trying here once at so 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:32.390
 for example, come here and we 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:35.300
 select and then see that too 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:40.010
 already shines on the panel of the 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:45.370
 By the way, cockpit from above has me 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.370
 I do not know 100-150 big ones 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.430
 they light up on none at all 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.430
 problem 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.140
 that works too 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:13.790
 or if I am now to diplom sounds 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:20.210
 attachment then we have too 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:27.430
 if the autopilot disconnects the 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:27.430
 So sound then it should be designed 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:41.960
 do you like that said that options 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.120
 yes, I am very satisfied with that 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.120
 I do not stop 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.220
 1000 of them spent on how 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.110
 it is natural with other manufacturers 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.210
 are the better quality you have to 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.670
 of course, but I have it myself 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.280
 built and I say for the beginning 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.900
 is enough and it may come later 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.550
 then a real new one 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.340
 far, I have actually shown everything 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.770
 First of all what I wanted to be 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.820
 and well if there is interest then 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.120
 I also like to do a new video 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:19.570
 about the function as the whole then 

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.570
 works ok until then a lot of fun
