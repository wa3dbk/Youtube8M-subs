00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.119
 to make a fondant carrot 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.989
 we need an orange fondant ball 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.750
 and another smaller one of green fondant 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.610
 we'll start with the carrot 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.119
 we will make a trickle with the fondant 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.119
 orange 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.320
 and flatten we have one end with 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.320
 finger 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.420
 with a ball of wake or with the handle of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.760
 a spoon we make a small 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 hole in the end that we have flattened 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.180
 this will help us to fit the leaves 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 then we will prepare the leaves 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.440
 To do this, we crush the finger with 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.750
 grandmother of green fondant 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.750
 and alice one of the extremes 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.170
 with a knife we will make some cracks 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.170
 in the part that we have smoothed 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.100
 and from the other end we will take out a small 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 peak 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.360
 this peak is the one that will go inside the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.869
 hole that we made in the part of the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.869
 carrot 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.360
 we will stick the two ends together with 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.360
 a brush a little water 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.830
 finally we only have to make some 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.990
 small cuts with a knife 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.990
 simulating the drawing of the carrot 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 Let it dry for at least 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.560
 12 hours
