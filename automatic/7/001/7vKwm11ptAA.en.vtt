00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:21.609
 after there tyson losers weaver 2015 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.160
 we have revolutionized in a way 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.500
 substantial game not only at the level of 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.480
 gameplay but also with regards to the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.349
 presentation of the game in mode e 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.269
 online 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.190
 all this was possible because 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.379
 we had an extra year and got to know 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 and use the powerful fox engine e 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.210
 this has brought a new lifeblood 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.829
 one of the most important changes of 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.239
 this year we have opened a new one 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.609
 study in england 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.469
 obviously the Japanese studio knows what 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.379
 is doing the but we also wanted the team 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.449
 were the home of football in Europe 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.059
 better understand the fans and what 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.429
 they want the opening of this new one 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.410
 study was certainly an opportunity 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.019
 unique to make changes 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.520
 key to the game the first thing to which 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.520
 we thought at the beginning of 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.960
 development of pes 2015 was like 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 revolutionize the gameplay 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.549
 we listened to the requests of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.310
 our fans asked us to recreate the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.159
 classic feeling of press that is not alone 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.329
 score a great goal but create action 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.820
 which leads to scoring 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.380
 textbook defensive action i 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.030
 players want each player 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.009
 have your own style 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.590
 pirlo must know how to do the perfect 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.049
 filtering or pop passage but must 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.939
 sprint through the midfield 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.950
 the idea of ​​recreating the true feeling of 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.979
 pes is what is fed all the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.590
 process of development of pes 2015 of 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.590
 process and making the ship gate 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 wow we're his fans of course 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 we followed the advice of the fakes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.450
 all aspects of the game since 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.870
 presentation there are new menus of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 game 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.260
 the statistics are updated 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.030
 weekly as the form of 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.310
 players or their injuries or 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 even transfers the costume 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.020
 of online we have new online modes 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.240
 like the ever club that replaces the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.710
 master league online but the club is the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.660
 how you can create yours 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.300
 team also through micro 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.550
 Transactions is a decidedly mode 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.650
 innovative that we worked a lot on 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.080
 something we would never have tried to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.910
 do until last year we also have 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.520
 renewed the master league since it is 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.570
 so dear to the players of pes 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.210
 especially with regards to the phase 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.670
 of the transfers we have also added 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.710
 coach licenses for example 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.900
 comparing with you and with 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.480
 guardiola will be seen in the field of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.310
 completely different game styles 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 many questions are asked every year 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.690
 as regards fishing licenses 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.230
 and although it is early to go down in the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 details 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.620
 I can already confirm that we have 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.480
 maintained the exclusivity of the uefa 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.640
 champions league 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.560
 we also have the counterpart 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 South American the libertadores cup and the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.160
 Asian champions league in pes 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.370
 we will therefore find the three main ones 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.260
 then exclusive club competitions 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.820
 there will also be second divisions 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.700
 like the Italian one and the Spanish one 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.530
 the French and the English one in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 future we will also announce other licenses 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.400
 of various teams various states then 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.850
 I advise fans to keep their eyes well 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.310
 open 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.050
 community feedback has been 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 very important to make changes 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.970
 substantial to the modes preferred by the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.100
 gamers in the master league 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.320
 I could manager on license we have 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.330
 added coaches to every team that 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.920
 will allow players to create everyone 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.690
 the coaches they want 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.730
 we have also renewed creation 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 of stadiums with new options on desire 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.090
 I'm sure fans won't do it this year 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.490
 will wait to get their hands on pes 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.290
 for next-generation consoles e 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.390
 we really worked a lot for 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.370
 don't disappoint their expectations 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.260
 graphically it is very different and there is a 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.180
 new lighting system that 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.860
 allows you to recreate the passage of the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.360
 time 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.310
 if for example we start a game of 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.830
 afternoon with evening arrival at 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.540
 shadows will dynamically change the 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.300
 graphic representation of the public and theirs 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.430
 animations are ten times higher and 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.209
 in general it is graphically much more 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.209
 true to reality 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 su de siervo has its years ago 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.890
 the thing though most of the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.000
 gamers want to know is what a game 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.220
 will run 1080p and 60 frames per second 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.410
 and this I can confirm already from now 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.840
 one of the fundamental aspects that 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 they wanted the 2015 country is that 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.440
 the gaming experience was the same 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.250
 regardless of the platform of 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.230
 game 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.419
 obviously who has a console next 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.070
 gen wants to make the most of it ed 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.590
 we made sure they had that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.700
 who desire but the feeling because it will be 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.950
 the same on all platforms so 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.020
 I'm pingue of cut the guys working 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.730
 whiteout an exclusive height that does not 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.380
 we still announced by none 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.290
 part and that we have renewed 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.150
 completely sound compartment 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.310
 we wanted the audio to always be suitable 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.800
 to the context yes if for example we perform 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.570
 a slip hurt the public ce 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.940
 he will note the holidays we also have 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.130
 changed the commentator for Italy and 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.660
 for the first time I can confirm that 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.660
 will be fabio caressa and fabio 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.580
 hello gay
