 They always wanted their favorite jersey of theirs

 Club especially memories of the last holiday or concert experiences

 Dust-free to the wall or preserved for posterity 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
 the club grew from these it is no longer a problem from now on 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.659
 We show you how it works 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.550
 with the Fraport from Nielsen you get a complete package including accessories

 Franco Xingu is assembled using the enclosed assembly instructions 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 The first thing they do is remove the hanger in the frame 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 To do this, take the Borscher Blome marker and make reference to this the middle of the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.170
 frame 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.650
 then do not remove the film from the adhesive side of the film 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.080
 both sides 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.960
 the adhesive strips on the long side of the parking now sticks the second foil 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.910
 peel off the hook and place the hook at the marked position on the inside of the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.280
 Give up frame 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.790
 the hook should be placed on the lower edge of the framework program 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.110
 become 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.640
 the adhesive strip kick duration 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 Now they just need a decent space on the wall 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.310
 in addition to a pen mark the drill holes with the enclosed 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.010
 template 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.480
 then attach the hanger to the wall with the screws and dowels 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.710
 with the two narrow screws, the two staircases become the top of the wall 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 attached while the two amarcord screws attached ounces to the wall 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120
 become 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 When this happens, hang the frame on the wall 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.320
 now you can use the special wrench the hammer head 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.820

 Decorated at will 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.910
 For example, take a jersey from your favorite club 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.380
 To do this, take the hanger and hang the jersey on both 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.070
 it is then attached to the hook in the frame 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.260
 In order to be able to fix the jersey better, good pins can be used with it 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.810
 nothing more slipping in the room or hanging awry 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 Finally, just use the lid on the frame and you're done 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.070
