00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
you are Alex and this is our 125 project

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.100 
you are Alex and this is our 125 project
ya<00:00:09.320> see<00:00:10.320> wonderful<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> see<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> 135<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:12.929> have

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
ya see wonderful to see a 135 so we have

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.210 
ya see wonderful to see a 135 so we have
here<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:15.859> digital<00:00:16.859> signal<00:00:17.520> processor

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
here is a digital signal processor

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.920 
here is a digital signal processor
harmonizer<00:00:20.220> harmonizer<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.359> reverb<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
harmonizer harmonizer with reverb and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279 
harmonizer harmonizer with reverb and
delay<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> he<00:00:24.000> will<00:00:24.119> play<00:00:24.330> tones<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> will

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
delay so he will play tones and I will

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.730 
delay so he will play tones and I will
flip<00:00:25.470> switches<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.269> we<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.500> play

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
flip switches and we will see so play

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.850 
flip switches and we will see so play
here's<00:00:29.960> straight<00:00:30.960> eat<00:00:31.170> own<00:00:32.899> right

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
here's straight eat own right

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340 
here's straight eat own right
so<00:00:36.860> I'm<00:00:37.130> going<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.280> turn<00:00:37.460> on<00:00:37.760> awesome<00:00:38.600> down<00:00:38.810> go

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
so I'm going to turn on awesome down go

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.600 
so I'm going to turn on awesome down go
down<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.950> turn<00:00:43.220> on<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:44.559> minor<00:00:45.559> third<00:00:45.890> with

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
down the turn on a minor third with

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.090 
down the turn on a minor third with
office<00:00:47.180> women<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:48.050> fundamental<00:00:48.379> element<00:00:48.920> to

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
office women the fundamental element to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.210 
office women the fundamental element to
do<00:00:50.949> now<00:00:51.949> I'm<00:00:52.129> turning<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:52.519> perfect<00:00:53.180> fit

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
do now I'm turning on perfect fit

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:09.030 
do now I'm turning on perfect fit
including<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.309> lantern<00:00:57.790> now<00:00:58.790> take<00:00:59.420> my<00:00:59.780> seven

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.890 

perfect<00:01:10.040> bill<00:01:10.250> on<00:01:10.610> his<00:01:10.820> own<00:01:11.000> I'm<00:01:11.330> shouldn't

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
perfect bill on his own I'm shouldn't

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.520 
perfect bill on his own I'm shouldn't
major<00:01:12.880> major<00:01:13.880> certain<00:01:14.360> measures<00:01:14.690> up<00:01:14.870> about

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
major major certain measures up about

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.710 
major major certain measures up about
down<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.890> matter<00:01:16.930> with<00:01:17.930> low

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.580 

la<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.250> guess<00:01:26.250> we'll<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.490> claps<00:01:27.410> sounds<00:01:28.410> good

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
la I guess we'll do claps sounds good

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
la I guess we'll do claps sounds good
alright<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.540> variable<00:01:30.930> delay<00:01:31.229> well

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
alright so we have a variable delay well

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550 
alright so we have a variable delay well
variable<00:01:32.250> delay<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.820> Sam<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.720> pro<00:01:34.110> clapper

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
variable delay and Sam the pro clapper

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.300 
variable delay and Sam the pro clapper
so<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.729> delay<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so this is the delay on this is more of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.570 
so this is the delay on this is more of
a<00:01:38.369> river<00:01:39.320> yeah<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.800> is<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> minimal

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
a river yeah this is with a minimal

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.980 
a river yeah this is with a minimal
reverb<00:01:43.190> does<00:01:44.190> allowed<00:01:47.600> there<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.660> go<00:01:48.750> that's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
reverb does allowed there you go that's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.520 
reverb does allowed there you go that's
good<00:01:49.729> now<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.420> degrees<00:01:51.750> re

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
good now this is what in degrees re

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.960 
good now this is what in degrees re
river<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:56.550> is<00:01:56.670> matt<00:01:57.149> summary<00:01:57.690> river

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.690 

now<00:02:02.650> reality<00:02:03.650> also<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.010> trailing<00:02:04.400> really

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
now reality also a trailing really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.240 
now reality also a trailing really
lately<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:07.160> is<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> minimum<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.030> delay

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.520 

this<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> medium<00:02:14.030> feeling<00:02:14.390> elated<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:18.350> is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
this is a medium feeling elated this is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
this is a medium feeling elated this is
what<00:02:18.680> max<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.160> transfer<00:02:19.640> lately<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:22.130> love
