00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 for the first time in santiago de chile- 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.799
 we are in the traditional super old 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 Mapocho station that in this opportunity 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.690
 they have turned it into this great fair of the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 sport is a dedicated exhibition 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.789
 especially everything you have to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 see with running in the expomaratón as 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 we know a round for all this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 exposure to see what fun and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.599
 are there for sport and you 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.599
 you come with us 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 in kabul bean 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.339
 knowing of the star of this expo 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.980
 marathon is the launch of the new 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.980
 adidas shoe is called energy bus 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.600
 but basically more than a sneaker 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.150
 of release that a new material is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 the idea this material is power 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.850
 replace and improve what has been done 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.230
 so far in this case all the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.540
 pads of the world since the 80s 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.860
 was that a light night and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.410
 cushioning everything perfect that material 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 zero for durability bus and to replace 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.750
 this radically change the booth 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.390
 the record is something like they have sneakers 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.160
 it's much softer so dampens 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.050
 much more efficient and there are multiple 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.220
 deliver much more boost this material 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.229
 it compresses and expands in a way 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.940
 elastic then dampens and also 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.120
 impulse damped impulse at every step 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.240
 what a give 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.240
 yes 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.750
 yes 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.189
 the technology they use here how much 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.770
 it takes more or less time to create 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.719
 in will radically change the technology 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.609
 that is being used with the EBA to a bus 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.219
 this material inside what gives days in 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.469
 the three years is to develop it that 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.990
 it was something invented by adidas used the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.810
 nasa first of all and also what 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.549
 accepted formula 1 did not change that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.530
 technology and adapted it to the sport of 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.140
 this case a single earth says morán 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.750
 like three years that transition between something 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.400
 which is like something like not so efficient 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.079
 as for that sport to do it or 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.440
 transform it into a jungle day of 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.440
 portion 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.220
 in an ordinary refrigerator was 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.890
 minus 50 traditional material 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.860
 it is cold it is compressed and put in its 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.790
 hard mind almost doubles its stiffness 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.769
 to maracena 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.659
 and bush at the same temperature 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.280
 keeps extremely stable that does not have 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.689
 elastic form and also retains all 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.310
 the cushioning properties and 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.780
 elasticity the bush are already 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.159
 available so that the valley people will 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.680
 I buy them this negative look at three 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.090
 colors still so I calculate that already 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.620
 after us models and they go to 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 come through that inside the model 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.670
 Sibelius is like the shoe that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.099
 any radio is looking for a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.319
 Amateur until a hilito the chapel is 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.209
 textile and that material and a technology 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.109
 that day by day is that if we are going to breathe 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.120
 it's like the list of that area like 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.639
 compression session tighten has already happened 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.950
 textile dress a shoe 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.659
 compression to run then wraps 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 the foot in elastic form avoids any 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.780
 rubbing does not have to build inside like that 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 that avoids any kind of education 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.240
 we just jump and accumulate a 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.700
 energy that is going to become a 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.710
 message for runners imagine 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.710
 here once you finish running 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.480
 you write a little message on the ipad that 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.150
 go to the side you put the code of the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.680
 number look at the broker number and you 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.300
 You put a message that you want when 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.910
 are running and going by kilometer 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.520
 39 there is an arch that has some sensors 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.770
 that activate some sensors that you have 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.270
 little piece of paper and what do you do is the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.920
 message that you have written to people 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.900
 that has been here good then the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
 guys are running from repo see a 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.709
 message from his family of his friends from 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.709
 her in love her in love etcetera 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.060
 you knew all the technology that they have 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.010
 the new adidas energy bus from 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.010
 santiago de chile we return to the c
