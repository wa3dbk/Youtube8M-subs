00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:13.250
 replacing rings on almera g15 as we know 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 many swim momentum 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:22.070
 because here is such 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:25.820
 I bought a thin ring thicker 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.820
 rubber equipment store 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.550
 what we need for this to change in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.329
 first this is a key for 8 to 10 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:49.489
 tharks head 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:49.489
 e-8 and here's the key is the torx 25 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.329
 first thing we do is 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:07.790
 I unscrew this bolt by 10 and take it away 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:13.690
 it aside then remove means 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.270
 gas cable is the same we take it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.040
 there is a gum here that is, we have it 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.960
 have pushed aside 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.920
 and space as it were freed us 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.440
 after which we are from this place completely 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.220
 just pull it just fastens there and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 we take the side too, whom we take out to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.470
 before yourself you should not forget to take off here 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 this pipe that goes to the vacuum 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 he just disengages here as if 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.800
 and left 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.820
 after which it means when we are all 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.210
 freed up 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.140
 go to the removal 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:07.540
 whether this plane is bom ba sen and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.520
 here are two bolts then bottom and 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.620
 analysis is worth it here 2 here next 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:25.940
 unscrew here so take 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:31.220
 with my crust and like that opening one 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:37.910
 this side is another well-fed when we 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.170
 unscrewed two bolts remove immediately here 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.590
 these suitable 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.480
 their connector 3 1 2 and this is the third one 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:55.550
 just snap and take off the most 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.660
 Of course it's difficult to remove it like this 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:03.650
 I donâ€™t know how to call it 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 general here is this bells and whistles well she 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.950
 unscrewed on two bolts which 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.400
 stand behind her and for this we need 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.470
 key for 8 is exactly this format 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.070
 because to twist like this 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.070
 more convenient 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.319
 and then collect in reverse 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.319
 sequences 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.160
 in many forums I looked there like 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.550
 showed that this nut is necessary 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.290
 unscrew this is the most important thing she 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.390
 as if holding this unit my 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.530
 the filter is not located in this place but 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.630
 it is located exactly here already here 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.360
 and when we took this one away 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.530
 that is, it is drawn back to us then 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.980
 need to have this one key so that 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:11.019
 have he this seems grandfather hook 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:14.300
 this is torso 25 25 after replacing these rings 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.070
 as we see one thinner than the other much 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.340
 thicker 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.440
 turnover dropped sharply and when i 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.660
 started up 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:33.520
 It was 3000 rpm at 25 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:38.330
 degrees now for now 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.100
 Turnover fell significantly Come 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.760
 I'll show you the car now 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.180
 of course on the street minus damn 25 pipets 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.180
 full 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.840
 cold fitting machine 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.840
 icy as hell frozen pancake 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 Where is the cabin show 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.110
 all played and our main thing now 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:23.120
 attention so to speak on the tachometer 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.120
 what will be the momentum 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.539
 so apparently here from 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.539
 completely 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.519
 here they jumped 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.010
 and 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.190
 went to warm up 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.920
 i.e. turns get out 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.900
 thousand there 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:59.020
 all but not like I had three thousand 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.320
 that is, I think it's okay then 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.630
 there is a russian ring 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.990
 store bought zina equipment for 25 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:13.000
 rubles significantly reduced savings 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.360
 gasoline at least as much as maria 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.360
 earlier
