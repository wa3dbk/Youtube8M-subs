00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
few years would hit bumps would bottom

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
few years would hit bumps would bottom
out<00:00:23.670> quite<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> bit<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.600> she<00:00:25.109> wasn't<00:00:25.260> really

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890 
out quite a bit and she wasn't really
enjoying<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> ride<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.660> that's<00:00:27.660> when<00:00:27.810> we

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
enjoying the ride so that's when we

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.230 
enjoying the ride so that's when we
started<00:00:28.170> searching<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.800> found<00:00:29.029> ran<00:00:30.029> into

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
started searching and we found ran into

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.920 
started searching and we found ran into
legend<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.009> they<00:00:32.009> were<00:00:32.660> kept<00:00:33.660> hearing<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they were the best shocks out there so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
they were the best shocks out there so
we<00:00:36.329> went<00:00:36.450> ahead<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.780> went<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.559> we

shot after about you know say about

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.389 
shot after about you know say about
16,000<00:00:49.590> miles<00:00:50.270> they<00:00:51.270> weren't<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:51.539> good<00:00:52.399> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
16,000 miles they weren't very good you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
16,000 miles they weren't very good you
know<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.270> consistency<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.230> where

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
know with these the consistency on where

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
know with these the consistency on where
you<00:00:55.649> keep<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> able<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> adjust<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> stays<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you keep it able to adjust it stays the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
you keep it able to adjust it stays the

same so with that consistency like your

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
same so with that consistency like your
stock<00:01:01.079> shocks<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> coils<00:01:01.859> inside<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.370> them

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
stock shocks the coils inside of them

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
stock shocks the coils inside of them
they're<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.239> shot<00:01:03.449> after<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> while<00:01:03.930> while<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
they're the shot after a while while the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
they're the shot after a while while the
air<00:01:04.439> springs<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.060> air<00:01:06.210> springs

air springs they with the air springs

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.550 
air springs they with the air springs
that<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.720> having<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.170> keep<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that these having them keep that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
that these having them keep that
consistency<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> makes<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> real<00:01:09.510> nice<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to have that adjustability with just by

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
to have that adjustability with just by
using<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.000> thumb<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> could
