(upbeat music)

00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:09.209
- Hi, I'm Jerry James
Stone, and you're watching

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.477
Cooking Stoned.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.746
On today's show I'm going to make...

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.255
I'm going to make this
grilled cheese sandwich

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:16.717
which I think is just the best

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.785
grilled cheese sandwich ever.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.789
It has asparagus, which I love,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.325
and it's in season,
asparagus is everywhere.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.728
And I have a how-to video
on how to blanch asparagus

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:28.929
and how to store asparagus.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.064
So if you don't know how
to do those two things,

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.500
check out my how-to section.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.018
But also, on top of that,

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.798
this grilled cheese sandwich,

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:41.241
the top part of it is an egg in a basket.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.077
So it's an egg in a basket
grilled cheese sandwich.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:44.879
So when you cut into it,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.615
you just have this
amazing yolk everywhere,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.050
and it's gooey and cheesy and asparagus.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.452
It's just, I can't tell
you how many of them,

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.020
I've eaten so many of them.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.691
I mean, you can see how many I've eaten.

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.592
Anyway, I think you're
really gonna enjoy it.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.093
The first thing we need to do is prep

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.629
the cheesy part of our
grilled cheese sandwich.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.815
I'm just going to put some of this Gruyere

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:09.815
on the bread slices so
it's all nice and gooey.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.338
Now we're going to add our asparagus,

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:12.839
the blanched asparagus.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.107
If you don't know how to blanch asparagus,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.443
I have a video on this.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.631
Just check it out.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.557
You'll be a pro in no time, I swear.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:24.357
Now we're going to add
the remaining cheese.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.969
It's gonna be nice and gooey.

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:33.438
Which every grilled cheese
sandwich should be, right?

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.223
And then we're just going to
stick these in the broiler

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.568
for a few minutes, just to get the cheese

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.602
all nice and melted.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.104
You would typically
just do this in the pan,

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.872
but because this grilled cheese has

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.043
so many moving parts
with the asparagus and

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:50.577
the egg in the hole, it's just easier

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.541
to do it in the broiler first.

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:54.879
Now that we've made our egg in the hole

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.552
we're going to take our bottom half,

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.921
with the cheese and the asparagus,

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.255
add that to the pan.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.179
You might need more butter,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.091
depending on how much you put in.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.656
Look at that sizzling up.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.967
And now let's top off our sandwich.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:17.637
(upbeat music)
