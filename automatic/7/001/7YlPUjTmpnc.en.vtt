Adobe Flash it's a good idea just to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.220 
Adobe Flash it's a good idea just to
create<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.530> simple<00:00:15.129> Flash<00:00:15.549> movie<00:00:16.230> doesn't

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
create a simple Flash movie doesn't

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.929 
create a simple Flash movie doesn't
really<00:00:17.380> make<00:00:17.590> a<00:00:17.619> lot<00:00:17.860> of<00:00:17.890> sense<00:00:18.279> but<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.670> shows

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
you how flash really works so that's

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.609

way on my 20th frame let's do another

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.109 
way on my 20th frame let's do another
keyframe<00:01:51.890> I'm<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:53.040> choose<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.490> selection

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
keyframe I'm gonna choose my selection

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
keyframe I'm gonna choose my selection
tool<00:01:54.150> now<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.660> I'm<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.220> take<00:01:56.460> away<00:01:57.710> this
