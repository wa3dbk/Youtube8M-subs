Swansea on Sunday for some reason we've
just<00:01:58.439> been<00:01:58.619> completely<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> boil<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
just been completely off the boil the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
just been completely off the boil the
passing<00:02:00.750> there's<00:02:00.899> been<00:02:01.020> no<00:02:01.170> desire<00:02:01.619> there's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
passing there's been no desire there's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.270 
passing there's been no desire there's
been<00:02:02.100> such<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> slow<00:02:02.850> tempo<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.409> can't<00:02:05.100> put

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
been such a slow tempo and you can't put

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.410 
been such a slow tempo and you can't put
your<00:02:05.369> finger<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.149> sure<00:02:06.270> whether

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
your finger on it I'm not sure whether

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
your finger on it I'm not sure whether
we're<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> bit<00:02:07.079> tired<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> bit<00:02:07.560> jaded<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
we're just a bit tired a bit jaded and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
we're just a bit tired a bit jaded and
therefore<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:09.090> exit<00:02:09.599> from<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.840> competition

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
therefore our exit from this competition

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.530 
therefore our exit from this competition
might<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.739> help<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> second

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
might actually help but then the second

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.880 
might actually help but then the second
heart

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
heart

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.410 
heart
as<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.430> said<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.700> hard<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.940> explain<00:02:14.180> because

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
as I said it's hard to explain because

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.540 
as I said it's hard to explain because
we<00:02:14.660> look<00:02:14.810> quite<00:02:15.020> good<00:02:15.050> 2nd<00:02:15.590> half<00:02:15.740> sporting<00:02:16.310> sat

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
we look quite good 2nd half sporting sat

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.710 
we look quite good 2nd half sporting sat
back<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.790> thought<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.209> could<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.480> come<00:02:17.660> out

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
back I thought they could have come out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.930 
back I thought they could have come out
was<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> bit<00:02:18.110> more<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.400> passing<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:19.850> was

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
was a bit more but the passing there was

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.460 
was a bit more but the passing there was
a<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.090> more<00:02:20.120> inventiveness<00:02:20.900> bit<00:02:21.319> more

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
a bit more inventiveness bit more

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.410 
a bit more inventiveness bit more
creativity<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.459> think<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.910> deserved<00:02:23.270> a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
creativity and I think we deserved a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.500 
creativity and I think we deserved a
couple<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.780> goals<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.110> got<00:02:24.260> three<00:02:24.590> but

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
couple of goals we got three but

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.640 
couple of goals we got three but
hopefully<00:02:26.510> as<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.720> said<00:02:26.900> moving<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
hopefully as I said moving on to the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.380 
hopefully as I said moving on to the
Chelsea<00:02:28.010> game<00:02:28.190> we've<00:02:28.640> got<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.850> bit<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> belief

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
should hug the ball it really was superb

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880 
should hug the ball it really was superb
to<00:03:02.180> watch<00:03:02.360> no<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.810> agree<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.800> way

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890

to watch no I agree with that the way
they<00:03:04.070> swarmed<00:03:04.730> backwards<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.209> forwards<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
they swarmed backwards and forwards and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.420 
they swarmed backwards and forwards and
I<00:03:05.690> was<00:03:05.810> thinking<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.200> Marston<00:03:06.650> Venga<00:03:06.950> when

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
I was thinking that I Marston Venga when

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.040 
I was thinking that I Marston Venga when
he<00:03:07.519> talked<00:03:07.700> about<00:03:07.940> Barcelona<00:03:08.150> he<00:03:08.720> called

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
he talked about Barcelona he called

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.690 
he talked about Barcelona he called
talked<00:03:09.290> about<00:03:09.500> sterile<00:03:09.920> domination<00:03:10.580> and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
talked about sterile domination and

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.910 
talked about sterile domination and
which<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.540> sort<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.080> sort<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.620> agreed

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
which is sort of like sort of agreed

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.470 
which is sort of like sort of agreed
with<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.160> twin<00:03:13.400> extend<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> Barcelona<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
with that twin extend the Barcelona the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.640 
with that twin extend the Barcelona the
way<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.690> they<00:03:14.780> play<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.140> little<00:03:15.350> bit<00:03:15.440> slow

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
way that they play is a little bit slow

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.170 
way that they play is a little bit slow
for<00:03:15.680> me<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.459> if<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:16.670> was<00:03:16.820> sterile

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
for me and if but if that was sterile

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.120 
for me and if but if that was sterile
domination<00:03:17.720> well<00:03:17.840> let<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.140> did<00:03:18.380> was<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> virile

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
domination well let it did was a virile

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.160 
domination well let it did was a virile
domination<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.209> found<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.600> much<00:03:20.930> more

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
domination and I found that much more

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.380 
domination and I found that much more
engaging<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:21.829> another<00:03:22.370> question<00:03:22.820> for<00:03:22.970> you

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
engaging but another question for you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.240 
engaging but another question for you
if<00:03:23.750> city<00:03:24.170> were<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.500> not<00:03:24.680> win<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:24.920> league<00:03:25.070> this

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
if city were to not win the league this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.800 
if city were to not win the league this
season<00:03:25.310> do<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.030> think<00:03:26.239> man<00:03:26.390> Cheney<00:03:26.600> will

still be there at the beginning of next
season

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
season

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.030 
season
would<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.820> want<00:03:28.970> him<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.209> still<00:03:29.420> be<00:03:29.540> there<00:03:30.040> yes

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040

would you want him to still be there yes

and yes I remember Mike and I think

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.140 
and yes I remember Mike and I think
Flush<00:03:33.980> was<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.400> studio<00:03:34.610> once<00:03:34.910> give<00:03:35.060> me

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
Flush was in the studio once give me

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.819 
Flush was in the studio once give me
this<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.329> while<00:03:35.600> ago<00:03:35.630> will<00:03:36.049> man<00:03:36.260> Cheney<00:03:36.500> stay

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
this a while ago will man Cheney stay

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.949 
this a while ago will man Cheney stay
yes<00:03:37.370> yes<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.910> they<00:03:38.000> both<00:03:38.180> laughed<00:03:38.390> at<00:03:38.630> me<00:03:38.780> but

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
yes yes and they both laughed at me but

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.289 
yes yes and they both laughed at me but
the<00:03:39.110> owners<00:03:39.470> they're<00:03:40.430> not<00:03:40.579> like<00:03:40.760> Abramovich

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
the owners they're not like Abramovich

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.490 
the owners they're not like Abramovich
they<00:03:41.510> know<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:41.930> need<00:03:42.110> some<00:03:42.320> stability

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
they know that we need some stability

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.250 
they know that we need some stability
and<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.970> think<00:03:44.299> if<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:44.660> don't<00:03:44.780> win<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.110> league

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
and I think if we don't win the league

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.050 
and I think if we don't win the league
this<00:03:45.410> season<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.860> much<00:03:46.040> as<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.400> hurts<00:03:46.730> me<00:03:46.880> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
this season as much as it hurts me to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.699 
this season as much as it hurts me to
say<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.450> will<00:03:47.570> actually<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:48.019> done<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.380> unite

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
say it will actually be done to unite

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.970 
say it will actually be done to unite
its<00:03:49.660> powers<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.840> some<00:03:51.019> kind<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.320> state<00:03:51.560> with<00:03:51.829> us

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
its powers of some kind of state with us

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.009 
its powers of some kind of state with us
despite<00:03:52.340> having<00:03:52.880> an<00:03:53.090> inferior<00:03:53.600> squad<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
despite having an inferior squad and

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.870 
despite having an inferior squad and
despite<00:03:54.320> not<00:03:54.500> playing<00:03:54.530> well<00:03:54.950> rather<00:03:55.400> than<00:03:55.610> our

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
despite not playing well rather than our

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.479 
despite not playing well rather than our
own<00:03:56.140> downside<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.380> think<00:03:57.590> my<00:03:57.709> genie<00:03:57.950> will<00:03:58.190> stay

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
own downside I think my genie will stay

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.060 
own downside I think my genie will stay
he<00:03:58.700> needs<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.209> stay<00:03:59.420> we've<00:04:00.170> seen<00:04:00.440> what<00:04:00.739> happens

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
he needs to stay we've seen what happens

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.319 
he needs to stay we've seen what happens
when<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.459> stability<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.090> there's<00:04:02.239> no

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
when you have stability and there's no

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.330 
when you have stability and there's no
point<00:04:02.630> changing<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.620> manager<00:04:04.100> if<00:04:04.220> we

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
point changing the manager if we

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.920 
point changing the manager if we
finished<00:04:04.640> second<00:04:05.030> because<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.810> obvious

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
finished second because the obvious

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.569 
finished second because the obvious
candidate<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.590> come<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.829> would<00:04:06.980> be<00:04:07.010> Mourinho

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
candidate to come in would be Mourinho

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.099 
candidate to come in would be Mourinho
but<00:04:07.760> what<00:04:07.910> do<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.030> do<00:04:08.180> if<00:04:08.299> we<00:04:08.450> finished<00:04:08.750> second

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
but what do you do if we finished second

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.630 
but what do you do if we finished second
in<00:04:09.170> his<00:04:09.350> first<00:04:09.620> season<00:04:09.799> do<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.160> then<00:04:10.340> come<00:04:10.519> and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
in his first season do you then come and

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
United to decide yeah thing I think if

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.860

we<00:05:16.550> were<00:05:16.700> our<00:05:16.910> best<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.270> really<00:05:17.540> ought<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.660> have

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
we were our best we really ought to have

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.360 
we were our best we really ought to have
beaten<00:05:18.110> them<00:05:18.440> because<00:05:18.800> if<00:05:18.920> you<00:05:19.010> look<00:05:19.160> at<00:05:19.280> the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
beaten them because if you look at the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.280 
beaten them because if you look at the
ease<00:05:19.550> with<00:05:19.580> which<00:05:19.850> we've<00:05:20.240> swept<00:05:20.450> aside<00:05:20.600> Porto

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
ease with which we've swept aside Porto

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.470 
ease with which we've swept aside Porto
and<00:05:21.530> they're<00:05:22.220> up<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.730> three<00:05:23.000> four<00:05:23.210> places

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
and they're up to three four places

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.600 
and they're up to three four places
nothing<00:05:24.020> ahead<00:05:24.140> of<00:05:24.410> sporting<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.280> the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
nothing ahead of sporting in the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.550 
nothing ahead of sporting in the
domestic<00:05:26.120> league<00:05:26.270> then<00:05:26.600> we<00:05:27.200> ought<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.470> in

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
