00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
to get some of the edges and I actually
come<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> use<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.500> paint<00:01:31.829> again<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:34.009> be

doing this pit job let's try this color

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
doing this pit job let's try this color
later<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.490> I've<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.640> doing<00:01:45.060> bunch<00:01:45.270> of

these guy that would realize it because

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
these guy that would realize it because
I<00:01:47.070> use<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> color<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> sort<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.270> base

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I use this color to sort of be the base

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
I use this color to sort of be the base
for<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> paint<00:01:49.079> chips<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.560> well<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.189> you'll

for the paint chips as well so you'll
see<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.259> actually<00:01:52.350> hold<00:01:52.860> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
see that so I would actually hold this

see that so I would actually hold this
one<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.549> end<00:01:54.770> okay<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.070> takes<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
one off to the end okay so that takes a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
one off to the end okay so that takes a
little<00:01:56.490> bit<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.780> worrying<00:01:58.110> about

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
little bit more time just worrying about

LED<00:02:23.849> Belcher's<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.510> could<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.989> base

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
LED Belcher's this could be the base

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.920 
LED Belcher's this could be the base
color<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> silver<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.720> that's<00:02:27.840> just

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
color for the silver and so that's just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
color for the silver and so that's just
going<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.530> end<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.800> bolt<00:02:28.950> gun<00:02:29.220> the

around the edges of that they are just

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.810 
around the edges of that they are just
so<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.750> edge<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.230> shoulder<00:05:01.770> pad<00:05:02.100> just<00:05:02.730> to

so the edge of the shoulder pad just to

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.050 
so the edge of the shoulder pad just to
help<00:05:03.000> differentiate<00:05:03.480> that<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.840> bit<00:05:04.020> better<00:05:04.200> and

help differentiate that a bit better and

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.220 
help differentiate that a bit better and
here's<00:05:06.060> what<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.300> mentioned<00:05:06.600> before<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.960> the

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
here's what I mentioned before the the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.230 
here's what I mentioned before the the
calligar<00:05:07.590> blue<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.460> I'm<00:05:08.550> going<00:05:08.760> along<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.150> I'm

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
calligar blue so I'm going along and I'm

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.790 
calligar blue so I'm going along and I'm
just<00:05:09.480> putting<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.960> little<00:05:09.990> flex<00:05:10.470> here<00:05:10.680> and

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
just putting a little flex here and

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.540 
just putting a little flex here and
there<00:05:10.950> for<00:05:11.340> some<00:05:12.170> paint<00:05:13.170> chips<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:14.370> just

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
there for some paint chips so just

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.850 
there for some paint chips so just
random<00:05:14.730> spots<00:05:15.450> where<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.380> paint<00:05:16.590> might<00:05:16.740> have

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
random spots where the paint might have

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.770 
random spots where the paint might have
chipped<00:05:17.070> away<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.670> what<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.120> is<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.540> idea

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
chipped away and what this is the idea

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.380 
chipped away and what this is the idea
here<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:18.990> this<00:05:19.170> is<00:05:19.290> exposing<00:05:19.770> some<00:05:20.640> some<00:05:21.300> of

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
here is this is exposing some some of

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.030 
here is this is exposing some some of
the<00:05:21.480> paint<00:05:22.200> from<00:05:22.320> underneath<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:22.890> it's<00:05:23.010> a

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
the paint from underneath so it's a

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.920 
the paint from underneath so it's a
little<00:05:23.220> bit<00:05:23.310> lighter<00:05:23.550> in<00:05:23.760> color<00:05:23.970> catching<00:05:24.900> the

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
little bit lighter in color catching the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.980 
little bit lighter in color catching the
light<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.320> more<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:27.060> I'm<00:05:27.150> using<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.600> rhinox

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
light of it more so I'm using a rhinox

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.380 
light of it more so I'm using a rhinox
hide<00:05:28.230> here<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:28.560> dark<00:05:28.830> brown<00:05:29.130> on<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.880> inside<00:05:30.360> of

hide here so dark brown on the inside of
those<00:05:30.720> paint<00:05:31.170> chips<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.460> have<00:05:32.670> kind

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.550 
those paint chips and so you have kind
of<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:33.000> halo<00:05:33.300> effect<00:05:33.450> from<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.870> calligar<00:05:34.260> blue

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
of a halo effect from the calligar blue

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.250 
of a halo effect from the calligar blue
and<00:05:35.420> then<00:05:36.420> I'm<00:05:36.510> going<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.660> put<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> little<00:05:37.080> bit

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
and then I'm going to put a little bit

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.110 
and then I'm going to put a little bit
of<00:05:37.320> silver<00:05:37.530> in<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> middle<00:05:37.980> so<00:05:38.760> this<00:05:38.910> works

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
of silver in the middle so this works

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.230 
of silver in the middle so this works
for<00:05:39.300> any<00:05:39.450> sort<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.920> paint<00:05:40.920> chip<00:05:41.190> we<00:05:41.790> do<00:05:42.000> just

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
for any sort of paint chip we do just

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.660 
for any sort of paint chip we do just
take<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.480> last<00:05:43.290> highlight<00:05:43.860> color<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.400> you

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
take the last highlight color and you

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.060 
take the last highlight color and you
put<00:05:44.910> splotches<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.600> here<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.870> there<00:05:46.070> less

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
put splotches of it here and there less

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.220 
put splotches of it here and there less
is<00:05:47.250> better<00:05:47.430> you<00:05:48.360> can<00:05:48.480> always<00:05:48.570> add<00:05:48.780> more<00:05:48.810> it's

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
is better you can always add more it's

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.540 
is better you can always add more it's
hard<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.500> cover<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:49.800> up<00:05:49.860> later<00:05:50.100> though<00:05:50.340> and

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
hard to cover it up later though and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.340 
hard to cover it up later though and
then<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.330> put<00:05:51.450> some<00:05:51.630> brown<00:05:51.810> in<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.050> middle<00:05:52.290> of

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
then you put some brown in the middle of

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.320 
then you put some brown in the middle of
it<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.860> look<00:05:53.010> like<00:05:53.070> some<00:05:53.460> corroded<00:05:53.880> bits<00:05:54.060> and

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
it to look like some corroded bits and

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.810 
it to look like some corroded bits and
then<00:05:54.630> some<00:05:55.080> bright<00:05:55.500> silver<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.220> center<00:05:56.790> of

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
then some bright silver in the center of

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.150 
then some bright silver in the center of
it<00:05:57.000> and<00:05:57.260> that<00:05:58.260> makes<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:58.590> look<00:05:58.710> like<00:05:58.860> fresh

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
it and that makes it look like fresh

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.220

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.460 
scratches so here's the guy all done
like<00:06:01.530> I<00:06:01.650> said<00:06:01.710> table<00:06:02.340> top<00:06:02.490> level<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.870> paints

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
like I said table top level and paints

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.540 
like I said table top level and paints
up<00:06:04.530> pretty<00:06:04.740> quickly<00:06:04.980> you<00:06:05.130> could<00:06:05.310> do<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.460> whole

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
up pretty quickly you could do a whole

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.640 
up pretty quickly you could do a whole
batch<00:06:05.850> of<00:06:06.060> these<00:06:06.150> guys<00:06:06.360> probably<00:06:07.080> in<00:06:07.440> an

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
batch of these guys probably in an

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.890 
batch of these guys probably in an
evening<00:06:07.860> especially<00:06:08.820> once<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:09.390> figure<00:06:09.690> out<00:06:09.720> a

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
evening especially once you figure out a

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.810 
evening especially once you figure out a
technique<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.410> works<00:06:10.650> for<00:06:10.980> you<00:06:11.040> hope<00:06:11.730> you
