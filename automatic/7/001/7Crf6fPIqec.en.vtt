00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
the equalizer because I thought it was

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.199 
Carlos akiza emesis that's not very good
in<00:04:15.010> terms<00:04:15.159> of<00:04:15.310> his<00:04:15.459> technicals<00:04:15.909> but<00:04:16.060> if<00:04:16.150> you

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
in terms of his technicals but if you

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.460 
in terms of his technicals but if you
look<00:04:16.299> at<00:04:16.419> his<00:04:16.539> stand<00:04:16.780> tackle<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.229> slide

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
look at his stand tackle and slide

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.039 
look at his stand tackle and slide
tackle<00:04:17.859> their<00:04:17.979> 78<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.489> 77<00:04:19.060> he's<00:04:19.389> only<00:04:19.570> 21<00:04:19.930> years

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
tackle their 78 in 77 he's only 21 years

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.110 
tackle their 78 in 77 he's only 21 years
old<00:04:20.409> so<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:21.039> are<00:04:21.190> going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.430> improve<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.940> lot

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
old so they are going to improve a lot

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.399 
old so they are going to improve a lot
over<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> next<00:04:22.479> couple<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.960> years<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.349> I

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
over the next couple of years and I

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:24.779 
over the next couple of years and I
think<00:04:23.620> he<00:04:23.710> could<00:04:23.919> turn<00:04:24.190> out<00:04:24.219> to<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> pretty

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
think he could turn out to be a pretty

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.700 
think he could turn out to be a pretty
decent<00:04:25.240> player<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:25.990> sean<00:04:26.169> murray<00:04:26.380> stats

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710

as you see

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.680 
as you see
here<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.550> technicals<00:04:28.120> are<00:04:28.270> looking<00:04:28.540> really

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690

good<00:04:28.990> like<00:04:29.200> I'll<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.890> know<00:04:29.920> even<00:04:30.280> is

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
good like I'll you know even is

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.340 
good like I'll you know even is
dribbling<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.180> most<00:04:31.390> importantly<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.170> long

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
dribbling but most importantly is long

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.990 
dribbling but most importantly is long
passing<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.830> short<00:04:33.100> passing<00:04:33.490> his<00:04:33.580> curve<00:04:33.850> is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
passing a short passing his curve is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.760 
passing a short passing his curve is
longshot<00:04:34.210> things<00:04:34.750> like<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.260> of<00:04:35.590> course

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
longshot things like that and of course

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.470 
longshot things like that and of course
you<00:04:35.890> can<00:04:36.040> play<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.400> host<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.790> positions<00:04:37.270> so

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
you can play in a host of positions so

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.210 
you can play in a host of positions so
I'm<00:04:37.780> pretty<00:04:38.020> happy<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.500> get<00:04:38.620> an<00:04:38.740> Irish<00:04:39.010> player

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
I'm pretty happy to get an Irish player

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.070 
I'm pretty happy to get an Irish player
in<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.450> contribute<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:40.900> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
in like that to a to contribute to the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.050 
in like that to a to contribute to the
squad<00:04:41.290> because<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.860> think<00:04:42.310> even<00:04:42.550> though<00:04:42.910> we

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
squad because I think even though we

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.240 
squad because I think even though we
have<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> pretty<00:04:43.480> big<00:04:43.780> squad<00:04:44.080> well<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.800> guess<00:04:45.070> we

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
have a pretty big squad well I guess we

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.800 
have a pretty big squad well I guess we
don't<00:04:45.400> really<00:04:45.580> have<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.000> massive<00:04:46.270> squad<00:04:46.630> and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
don't really have a massive squad and

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.690 
don't really have a massive squad and
but<00:04:47.440> our<00:04:47.560> squad<00:04:47.830> could<00:04:48.130> do<00:04:48.250> with<00:04:48.430> some<00:04:48.580> more

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
but our squad could do with some more

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.130 
but our squad could do with some more
squad<00:04:48.970> players<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:49.480> that<00:04:49.660> who<00:04:49.810> could<00:04:50.020> be

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
squad players like that who could be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.930 
squad players like that who could be
potentially<00:04:50.680> utility<00:04:51.190> players<00:04:51.430> who<00:04:51.670> play<00:04:51.850> in

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
potentially utility players who play in

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.760 
potentially utility players who play in
other<00:04:52.090> positions<00:04:52.240> as<00:04:53.050> your<00:04:53.320> next<00:04:53.500> game<00:04:53.620> is

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
his debut which is an awesome way to

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
really as debut technically but I just

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.650 
really as debut technically but I just
remember<00:07:03.040> a<00:07:03.070> time<00:07:03.310> when<00:07:03.580> nobody<00:07:04.090> had<00:07:04.360> scored<00:07:04.600> a

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
remember a time when nobody had scored a

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.060 
remember a time when nobody had scored a
hattrick<00:07:04.810> until<00:07:05.260> like<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.500> fourth<00:07:05.830> season

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
hattrick until like the fourth season

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.920 
hattrick until like the fourth season
when<00:07:06.400> Via<00:07:06.580> Rail<00:07:06.760> got<00:07:07.120> one<00:07:07.300> in<00:07:07.390> the<00:07:07.480> champions

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
when Via Rail got one in the champions

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.090 
when Via Rail got one in the champions
league<00:07:08.020> and<00:07:08.170> then<00:07:08.410> you<00:07:08.500> got<00:07:08.620> another<00:07:08.830> one<00:07:08.980> in

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
league and then you got another one in

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.800 
league and then you got another one in
the<00:07:09.160> next<00:07:09.400> game<00:07:09.550> or<00:07:10.150> something<00:07:10.450> like<00:07:10.510> that<00:07:10.570> but

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
the next game or something like that but

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.630 
the next game or something like that but
it's<00:07:10.990> pretty<00:07:11.110> decent<00:07:11.620> but<00:07:12.040> with<00:07:12.340> that<00:07:12.490> we

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
it's pretty decent but with that we

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.520 
it's pretty decent but with that we
qualify<00:07:13.120> for<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.419> Champions<00:07:13.900> League<00:07:14.169> and

cska moscow and aik so i think it's a
pretty<00:07:21.130> winnable<00:07:21.640> group<00:07:21.850> for<00:07:22.060> us<00:07:22.150> and<00:07:22.330> we

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
pretty winnable group for us and we

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.320 
pretty winnable group for us and we
should<00:07:22.720> be<00:07:22.870> able<00:07:22.960> to<00:07:23.169> qualify<00:07:23.320> from<00:07:23.710> that
