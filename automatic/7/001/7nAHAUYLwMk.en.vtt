the dugong could it be I don't know it's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.209 
the dugong could it be I don't know it's
it's<00:01:56.820> obviously<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.960> weak<00:01:58.619> disabled

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219

cut<00:02:06.600> glad<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> never<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.110> thought<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
cut glad I never even thought of that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.949 
cut glad I never even thought of that
but<00:02:07.829> here<00:02:07.979> comes<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> icy<00:02:08.550> winds<00:02:08.729> try<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> icy

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
but here comes the icy winds try to icy

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.150 
but here comes the icy winds try to icy
wind<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.500> solve<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.800> out<00:02:10.890> even<00:02:11.129> more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
wind would just solve it out even more

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
wind would just solve it out even more
but<00:02:11.459> honestly<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
but honestly at this right there

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.550 
but honestly at this right there
probably<00:02:13.050> already

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
probably already

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500 
probably already
so<00:02:13.650> negatively<00:02:14.040> invested<00:02:14.610> any<00:02:14.760> way<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so negatively invested any way that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
so negatively invested any way that
slowing<00:02:16.110> them<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.349> even<00:02:16.890> more<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.250> doesn't

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
slowing them down even more will doesn't

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
slowing them down even more will doesn't
make<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.970> difference<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.080> he<00:02:19.319> probably

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
make much of a difference so he probably

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
make much of a difference so he probably
was<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.920> made<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:20.819> things<00:02:21.090> twitching

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
was just made really things twitching

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.910 
was just made really things twitching
like<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:21.690> don't<00:02:21.840> know<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> other<00:02:22.080> two<00:02:22.319> Pokemon

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
like we don't know the other two Pokemon

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.260 
like we don't know the other two Pokemon
that<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> opponent<00:02:23.550> had<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.760> his<00:02:23.880> team<00:02:24.090> maybe

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
that the opponent had on his team maybe

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
that the opponent had on his team maybe
