lubrication points I picked it up for
$80<00:00:15.480> flat<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.680> believe<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.550> angle<00:00:17.820> grinder

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
$80 flat I believe with an angle grinder

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
$80 flat I believe with an angle grinder
for<00:00:18.300> 5<00:00:18.539> bucks<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.960> came<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.470> $89

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
for 5 bucks it came out to like $89

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.019 
for 5 bucks it came out to like $89
after-tax<00:00:21.140> uh<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.859> far<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
after-tax uh so far I really like it I

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
after-tax uh so far I really like it I
mean<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:25.949> idea<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.279> didn't<00:00:26.490> get

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
mean this is it's an idea I didn't get

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.529 
mean this is it's an idea I didn't get
the<00:00:26.699> low<00:00:27.060> profile<00:00:27.510> model<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.170> wasn't<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.470> sale

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
the low profile model it wasn't on sale

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.939 
the low profile model it wasn't on sale
unfortunately<00:00:30.539> maybe<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> future<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
unfortunately maybe in the future the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.670 
unfortunately maybe in the future the
aluminum<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:32.700> light<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
aluminum one it's very light but this is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
aluminum one it's very light but this is
one<00:00:34.829> full<00:00:35.040> pump<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.820> one

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
one full pump so this is gonna be one

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.510 
one full pump so this is gonna be one
full<00:00:42.210> pump<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:43.530> starts<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.160> five<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
full pump it starts off at five and a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
full pump it starts off at five and a
half<00:00:44.550> inches<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.390> car's<00:00:45.719> lowest

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
half inches so if your car's lowest

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.290 
half inches so if your car's lowest
point<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> lower<00:00:47.010> than<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.969> need

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
point is lower than that you will need

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.250 
point is lower than that you will need
the<00:00:48.899> low-profile<00:00:49.469> jack<00:00:51.530> that's<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.770> pump<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
the low-profile jack that's one pump and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
the low-profile jack that's one pump and
that's<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.739> cars<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> ground<00:00:56.610> so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that's two in my cars off the ground so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
that's two in my cars off the ground so
it<00:00:57.180> works<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:57.989> me

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it works really well for me

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.090 
it works really well for me
with<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.309> Subaru<00:00:59.579> over<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:01.500> would

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
with my Subaru over there I would

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
with my Subaru over there I would
recommend<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:02.969> anyone<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
recommend it for just about anyone that
wants<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> floor<00:01:04.680> jack<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.159> doesn't<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
night I was undercutting my car and it
it<00:01:16.049> held<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.220> mean<00:01:17.369> there's
