00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
it's rolled out to about an eighth of an

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
it's rolled out to about an eighth of an
inch<00:00:27.420> thick<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:29.599> thickness<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.859> you

the<00:00:42.570> great<00:00:42.809> thing<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.350> new<00:00:43.410> cutters

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the great thing about these new cutters

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
the great thing about these new cutters
is<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> straight<00:00:46.379> edge<00:00:46.649> or

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
is that you can have a straight edge or

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
is that you can have a straight edge or
you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:48.300> crimped<00:00:49.289> edge<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.950> can

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you can have a crimped edge so you can

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060 
you can have a crimped edge so you can
mix<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> match<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:52.410> along<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.770> your

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
mix and match as you go along with your

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.580 
mix and match as you go along with your
decorating<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> large<00:00:54.719> piece<00:00:55.050> here

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
decorating so I have a large piece here

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
decorating so I have a large piece here
and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> smaller

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and then I'm going to with a smaller

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
and then I'm going to with a smaller
size<00:00:58.050> I'll<00:00:58.739> cut<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> blue<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.730> I'll<00:00:59.850> use

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
size I'll cut out the blue and I'll use

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.100 
size I'll cut out the blue and I'll use
the<00:01:02.390> ruffled<00:01:03.390> edge<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:04.830> add<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:05.280> more

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the ruffled edge to add some more

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.980 
the ruffled edge to add some more
texture<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> smaller

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
texture and then we'll have a smaller

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.940 
texture and then we'll have a smaller
size<00:01:10.890> back<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> yellow<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.650> I'll<00:01:13.770> use

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
size back with the yellow and I'll use

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
size back with the yellow and I'll use
the<00:01:14.130> straight<00:01:14.430> edge<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> that's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the straight edge for that and that's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
the straight edge for that and that's
pretty<00:01:16.590> much<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.979> simple<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.000> gets<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
pretty much as simple as it gets for the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
pretty much as simple as it gets for the
overlay<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> attach<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

need<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:22.049> damp<00:01:23.090> brush<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> water<00:01:24.810> onto

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

lay them on top of each other however
I'll<00:01:31.290> Center<00:01:31.619> these<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.310> however<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.790> want

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
them to be and that's basically an

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.249 
them to be and that's basically an
overlay<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.020> pretty

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
overlay right there so that's pretty

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.700 
overlay right there so that's pretty
simple<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.840> show<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.560> an

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
simple so now I'll show you how to do an

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.999 
simple so now I'll show you how to do an
inlay<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.850> again<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.990> our<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.380> pieces<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
inlay so again we have our two pieces of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
inlay so again we have our two pieces of
fondant<00:01:47.460> rolled<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.970> different<00:01:48.450> colors<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
fondant rolled out different colors and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.700 
fondant rolled out different colors and
I'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> cut<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> piece<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.720> let's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I'm going to cut out a piece of let's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
I'm going to cut out a piece of let's
say<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> yellow<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:58.049> with

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
say the yellow and so the thing with

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.749 
say the yellow and so the thing with
inlay<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.159> bigger<00:01:59.399> piece

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
inlay is so you want your bigger piece

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.929 
inlay is so you want your bigger piece
and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> cut<00:02:01.490> I'll<00:02:02.490> go

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and then you're going to cut I'll go

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.460 
and then you're going to cut I'll go
with<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> smaller

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.980 

in<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.490> other<00:02:08.700> color<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.570> next

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
in your other color and now the next

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.200 
in your other color and now the next
step<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:11.130> need<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> cut<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> hole<00:02:11.670> into<00:02:12.060> your

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
step is you need to cut a hole into your

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.420 
step is you need to cut a hole into your
bigger<00:02:12.570> piece<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.440> lay<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:14.130> smaller

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
bigger piece so you can lay the smaller

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.630 
bigger piece so you can lay the smaller
piece<00:02:14.790> inside<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:17.100> doesn't<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> be

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
piece inside so it doesn't have to be

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
piece inside so it doesn't have to be
right<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> center<00:02:18.030> if<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.690> want<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.960> have

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it at an angle you can do that I'll try

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.500 
it at an angle you can do that I'll try
to<00:02:22.080> Center<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.770> one<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.850> we'll<00:02:24.000> cut<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.330> the
