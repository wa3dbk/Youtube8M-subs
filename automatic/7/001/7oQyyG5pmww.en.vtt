a big lie because you feel you which is
how<00:02:27.370> article<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.239> use<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:29.730> what

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
how article you can use because what

are<00:02:58.319> helping<00:02:58.799> similar<00:02:59.450> technologies<00:03:00.450> before

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
are helping similar technologies before

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.129 
are helping similar technologies before
but<00:03:01.680> they're<00:03:01.829> all<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.129> very<00:03:02.310> simple<00:03:02.900> by<00:03:03.900> using

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
but they're all be very simple by using

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.649 
but they're all be very simple by using
a<00:03:04.290> webcam<00:03:04.469> that's<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.670> there's<00:03:06.389> a<00:03:06.480> lot<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
a webcam that's because there's a lot of

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.390 
a webcam that's because there's a lot of
processing<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.409> needs<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.859> done<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
processing that needs to be done to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.229 
processing that needs to be done to
create<00:03:08.909> something<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.450> our<00:03:09.810> tournament<00:03:10.260> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
create something like our tournament and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.459 
create something like our tournament and
because<00:03:12.239> we<00:03:12.389> use<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.659> GPU<00:03:13.049> professor

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
because we use the GPU professor

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.750 
because we use the GPU professor
processing<00:03:14.150> graphical<00:03:15.150> person<00:03:15.419> so<00:03:16.760> many

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
processing graphical person so many

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
processing graphical person so many
people's<00:03:18.090> abilities<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.569> opened<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:18.930> which

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
people's abilities have opened up which

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.780 
people's abilities have opened up which
really<00:03:19.370> not<00:03:20.370> possible<00:03:21.379> so<00:03:22.379> smart<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.430> am<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.639> can

really not possible so smart I am I can

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.939 
really not possible so smart I am I can
be<00:03:23.939> used<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.239> lots<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.079> ways<00:03:25.139> for<00:03:25.319> example<00:03:25.560> for
