the sound quality well jawbone claims
its<00:01:17.790> noises<00:01:18.180> fasten<00:01:18.540> technology<00:01:19.170> eliminates

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

its noises fasten technology eliminates
background<00:01:20.400> sound<00:01:20.729> better<00:01:21.210> than<00:01:21.330> any<00:01:21.659> other

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
background sound better than any other

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.020 
background sound better than any other
headset<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.130> separate<00:01:23.580> speech

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
headset because it can separate speech

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
headset because it can separate speech
from<00:01:24.509> ambient<00:01:24.930> noise<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.189> some

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
from ambient noise so there's some

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
from ambient noise so there's some
really<00:01:26.549> interesting<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.509> objective

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
really interesting and very objective

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.270 
really interesting and very objective
testing<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> laboratory

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
testing you can do in laboratory

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
testing you can do in laboratory
conditions<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> there's<00:01:30.720> various<00:01:30.990> types<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
conditions so there's various types of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
conditions so there's various types of
noise<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.950> generate<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
noise you can generate which then you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.760 
noise you can generate which then you
cant<00:01:33.720> estyn<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.409> test<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
cant estyn that you can test the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.560 
cant estyn that you can test the
measurement

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
measurement

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.200 
measurement
and<00:01:35.960> how<00:01:36.200> much<00:01:36.350> noise<00:01:36.620> canceling<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.909> product

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
and how much noise canceling the product

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.180 
and how much noise canceling the product
generates<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.320> having<00:01:39.740> been<00:01:39.920> through<00:01:39.950> all

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
generates so having been through all

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.140 
generates so having been through all
those<00:01:40.310> tests<00:01:40.580> compared<00:01:40.940> with<00:01:41.030> our

those tests compared with our

old product we know that that noise

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.260 
old product we know that that noise
assassin<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> big<00:01:46.310> leap<00:01:46.490> forward<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.090> an

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
assassin is a big leap forward and an

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.210 
assassin is a big leap forward and an
improvement<00:01:47.540> over<00:01:47.780> will<00:01:48.110> be<00:01:48.229> others<00:01:48.410> let's

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
improvement over will be others let's

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.530 
improvement over will be others let's
see<00:01:49.400> what<00:01:49.520> happened<00:01:49.910> when<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.060> went<00:01:50.300> and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
see what happened when we went and
