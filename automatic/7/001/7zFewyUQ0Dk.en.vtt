00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
talk about pecan nuts let perhaps a

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.440 
talk about pecan nuts let perhaps a
strange<00:00:20.800> subject<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.520> be<00:00:21.640> on<00:00:21.760> a<00:00:21.790> chiropractic

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
strange subject to be on a chiropractic

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.720 
strange subject to be on a chiropractic
site<00:00:22.750> but<00:00:23.080> there's<00:00:23.320> actually<00:00:24.010> some<00:00:24.369> very<00:00:24.580> good

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
site but there's actually some very good

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.380 
site but there's actually some very good
reasons<00:00:24.910> for<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:26.170> first<00:00:26.350> is<00:00:26.590> that<00:00:26.770> pecans

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
reasons for it the first is that pecans

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.310 
reasons for it the first is that pecans
are<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:29.680> rich<00:00:30.039> in<00:00:30.340> two<00:00:30.730> important<00:00:31.390> oils<00:00:31.780> the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
are very rich in two important oils the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.369 
are very rich in two important oils the
one<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.619> called<00:00:32.860> oleic<00:00:33.430> acid<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:35.050> is<00:00:35.199> the

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
one is called oleic acid and it is the

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.710 
one is called oleic acid and it is the
major<00:00:35.590> component<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:37.000> fat<00:00:37.330> that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
major component of the fat that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.110 
major component of the fat that
surrounds<00:00:37.960> all<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.770> nerves<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.580> your<00:00:39.670> body

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
surrounds all the nerves in your body

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.350 
surrounds all the nerves in your body
without<00:00:41.020> that<00:00:41.470> myelin<00:00:41.920> sheath<00:00:42.220> nerves<00:00:42.879> will

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
without that myelin sheath nerves will

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.410 
without that myelin sheath nerves will
not<00:00:43.540> conduct<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.160> second<00:00:45.579> reason<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:46.000> the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
not conduct and second reason is the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.319 
not conduct and second reason is the
pecans<00:00:47.020> very<00:00:47.350> rich<00:00:47.649> in<00:00:47.860> omega-3<00:00:48.610> oils<00:00:49.030> and

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
pecans very rich in omega-3 oils and

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.880 
pecans very rich in omega-3 oils and
omega-3<00:00:49.989> oils<00:00:50.290> have<00:00:50.440> been<00:00:50.470> shown<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.720> reduce

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
omega-3 oils have been shown to reduce

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.069 
omega-3 oils have been shown to reduce
arthritis<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> body<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.840> course

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
arthritis in the body and of course

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.490 
arthritis in the body and of course
arthritis<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:57.070> chiropractic<00:00:57.730> are<00:00:58.500> two

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
arthritis and chiropractic are two

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.049 
arthritis and chiropractic are two
subjects<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.130> go<00:01:00.280> hand-in-hand

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
subjects that go hand-in-hand

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.670 
subjects that go hand-in-hand
now<00:01:01.600> one<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.930> important<00:01:02.350> things<00:01:02.559> about

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
now one of the important things about

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.770 
now one of the important things about
your<00:01:02.980> pecan<00:01:03.340> nut<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.730> that<00:01:04.360> if<00:01:04.449> you<00:01:04.540> want<00:01:04.720> to

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
your pecan nut is that if you want to

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.510 
your pecan nut is that if you want to
get<00:01:04.989> good<00:01:05.170> value<00:01:05.350> out<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.250> need<00:01:06.399> to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
get good value out of it you need to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.920 
get good value out of it you need to
crack<00:01:06.729> them<00:01:06.970> yourself<00:01:08.700> once<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.210> shell<00:01:10.539> has

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
crack them yourself once the shell has

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.609 
crack them yourself once the shell has
been<00:01:10.960> broken<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:12.220> oils<00:01:12.729> in<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.619> pecans

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
been broken the oils in the pecans

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.520 
been broken the oils in the pecans
become<00:01:15.960> oxidized<00:01:16.960> very<00:01:17.200> rapidly<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:19.440> what<00:01:20.440> I'm

again if you squeeze too hard it
shatters<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.880> nuts<00:02:04.090> into<00:02:04.329> a<00:02:04.450> million<00:02:04.810> pieces

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
shatters the nuts into a million pieces

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.530 
shatters the nuts into a million pieces
and<00:02:05.259> makes<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.740> more<00:02:05.890> difficult<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:07.210> just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
and makes it more difficult and you just

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.069 
and makes it more difficult and you just
keep<00:02:07.899> turning<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.100> nut<00:02:09.329> and<00:02:10.329> turning<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.959> nut

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
keep turning the nut and turning the nut

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.660 
keep turning the nut and turning the nut
and<00:02:12.040> turning<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.640> nut<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.320> making<00:02:14.320> sure<00:02:14.670> that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and turning the nut and making sure that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.259 
and turning the nut and making sure that
as<00:02:16.480> many<00:02:16.810> parts<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.769> at<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.220> top<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
as many parts of it at the top and the

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.470 
as many parts of it at the top and the
bottom<00:02:19.600> are<00:02:19.840> correct<00:02:20.560> now<00:02:21.340> really<00:02:21.730> what<00:02:22.180> could

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
bottom are correct now really what could

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
bottom are correct now really what could
be<00:02:22.600> easier<00:02:23.079> than<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
be easier than the
