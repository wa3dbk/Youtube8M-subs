00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
my auntie palm out at this point so I'm

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.280 
my auntie palm out at this point so I'm
just<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> switch<00:00:39.809> into<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.370> physical

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
just going to switch into my physical

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
just going to switch into my physical
wall<00:00:43.290> donphan<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
wall donphan and it's going to take that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.910 
wall donphan and it's going to take that
quite<00:00:45.899> nicely<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.530> looking<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
quite nicely but it's looking like a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
quite nicely but it's looking like a
four-hit<00:00:47.309> KO<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.690> he's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
four-hit KO at this point so he's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.119 
four-hit KO at this point so he's
obviously<00:00:49.170> gonna<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:49.920> i'm

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
obviously gonna go for the time i'm

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.439 
obviously gonna go for the time i'm
going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> predict<00:00:50.610> angle<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.090> earthquake

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
going to predict angle for earthquake

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to predict angle for earthquake
because<00:00:51.570> obviously<00:00:51.930> doesn't<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.800> me

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
because obviously doesn't want me

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.500 
because obviously doesn't want me
signing<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.280> my<00:00:53.399> stealth<00:00:53.670> rock<00:00:53.879> because

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
signing up my stealth rock because

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
signing up my stealth rock because
that's<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.809> MP<00:00:55.050> pound<00:00:55.230> ambipom<00:00:55.739> does<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that's what MP pound ambipom does it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's what MP pound ambipom does it
fakes<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.629> goes<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
fakes out and then it goes right for the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
fakes out and then it goes right for the
time<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
time so I'm just gonna go for the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
time so I'm just gonna go for the
earthquake<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> yeah<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.789> gonna<00:01:02.940> be

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
earthquake and yeah it's gonna be

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.700 
earthquake and yeah it's gonna be

team so I know at this point I'm gonna

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.020 
team so I know at this point I'm gonna
have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> switch<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.880> my

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have to switch out and go into my

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
have to switch out and go into my
special<00:02:00.600> wall<00:02:00.780> ignition<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.130> mulch

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
special wall ignition which is my mulch

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.880 
special wall ignition which is my mulch
ace<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.880> even<00:02:03.840> though<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> isn't<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.560> physical

ace and even though it isn't a physical
wall<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.579> obviously<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> able<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
wall it's obviously going to be able to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.410 
wall it's obviously going to be able to
take<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.290> cross<00:02:07.500> chop

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
take the cross chop

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.749 
take the cross chop
rather<00:02:08.539> nicely<00:02:08.810> from<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.520> Toxicroak<00:02:10.520> so

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
rather nicely from this Toxicroak so

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.760 
rather nicely from this Toxicroak so
yeah<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.380> take<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.590> nicely

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
yeah it's going to take it nicely

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.650 
yeah it's going to take it nicely
looking<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.520> fort<00:02:13.819> kale<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.239> him<00:02:14.390> again

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
looking like a fort kale for him again

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.559 
looking like a fort kale for him again
so<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:15.080> he's<00:02:15.319> going<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.790> switch<00:02:16.790> out<00:02:17.090> so

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
so I know he's going to switch out so

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.540 
so I know he's going to switch out so
predicting<00:02:18.410> him<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.739> go<00:02:18.860> into<00:02:19.069> something<00:02:19.520> that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
predicting him to go into something that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.790 
predicting him to go into something that
can<00:02:19.670> take<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.510> air<00:02:20.660> /<00:02:20.959> I'm<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.410> go<00:02:21.530> into

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
can take the air / I'm going to go into

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.830 
can take the air / I'm going to go into
dugtrio<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.970> was<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> nice<00:02:23.270> which<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.630> made

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
dugtrio that was a nice which I made

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600 
dugtrio that was a nice which I made
he's<00:02:24.080> gonna<00:02:24.170> go<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.410> flareon<00:02:24.860> now<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.310> can't

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
he's gonna go to flareon now you can't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.610 
he's gonna go to flareon now you can't
switch<00:02:25.819> out<00:02:26.000> due<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.180> arena<00:02:26.630> trap<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.380> I'm<00:02:27.470> just

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
switch out due to arena trap so I'm just

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.370 
switch out due to arena trap so I'm just
going<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:27.920> able<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.459> take<00:02:28.790> him<00:02:29.120> out<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:30.200> an

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
going to be able to take him out with an

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.140 
going to be able to take him out with an
earthquake<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.459> was<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:31.670> nice

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
earthquake so that was really nice

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.960 
earthquake so that was really nice
really<00:02:32.720> good<00:02:32.989> play<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.260> my<00:02:33.530> part<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.370> guess<00:02:34.819> he

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
really good play on my part I guess he

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.000 
really good play on my part I guess he
might<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.269> over<00:02:35.540> predicted<00:02:36.019> I<00:02:36.230> guess<00:02:36.739> he<00:02:36.920> was

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
might have over predicted I guess he was

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.270 
might have over predicted I guess he was
going<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.340> in<00:02:37.489> for<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.170> flash<00:02:39.170> fire<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.099> no<00:02:40.250> I

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
going to go in for a flash fire so no I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.490 
going to go in for a flash fire so no I
didn't<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.090> anything<00:02:41.269> well<00:02:41.660> yeah<00:02:41.870> yeah<00:02:42.290> I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
didn't go for anything well yeah yeah I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.100 
didn't go for anything well yeah yeah I
guess<00:02:42.650> splash<00:02:42.950> fire<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.880> nice<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.050> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
guess splash fire so nice is going to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.380 
guess splash fire so nice is going to
take<00:02:45.290> his<00:02:45.440> chance<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.069> mean<00:02:46.340> his<00:02:46.459> time<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.819> set

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
take his chance I mean his time to set

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.699 
take his chance I mean his time to set
up<00:02:47.480> his<00:02:47.569> stealth<00:02:47.810> rock<00:02:48.019> as<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.319> switch<00:02:48.560> because

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
up his stealth rock as I switch because

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.740 
up his stealth rock as I switch because
he<00:02:48.860> knows<00:02:48.980> he's<00:02:49.580> I'm<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:50.000> gonna<00:02:50.150> leave<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.540> in

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
he knows he's I'm not gonna leave it in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.680 
he knows he's I'm not gonna leave it in
a<00:02:51.019> dub<00:02:51.440> trio<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:53.000> split<00:02:53.299> score<00:02:53.540> because

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
a dub trio to the split score because

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.660 
a dub trio to the split score because
I'm<00:02:54.080> obviously<00:02:54.319> going<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:54.980> choice<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.459> some

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
I'm obviously going to be choice in some

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.220 
I'm obviously going to be choice in some
way<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:56.630> gonna<00:02:56.720> go<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.049> rapid

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
way so I'm just gonna go for the rapid

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.370 
way so I'm just gonna go for the rapid
spin<00:02:57.620> after<00:02:58.569> he<00:02:59.569> goes<00:02:59.690> for<00:02:59.870> an<00:02:59.959> earthquake

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
spin after he goes for an earthquake

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.720 
spin after he goes for an earthquake
because<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.040> know<00:03:01.100> I'm<00:03:01.250> going<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.459> be<00:03:01.519> able<00:03:01.580> to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
because I know I'm going to be able to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.130 
because I know I'm going to be able to
live<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.480> know<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:02.690> gonna<00:03:02.780> be<00:03:02.930> able<00:03:03.019> to

live it and I know I'm gonna be able to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.979 
live it and I know I'm gonna be able to
live<00:03:03.260> another<00:03:03.470> one<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:05.000> went<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
live another one so I went for the

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.840 
live another one so I went for the
earthquake<00:03:06.350> predicting<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.010> switch<00:03:07.310> actually

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
earthquake predicting a switch actually

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.160 
earthquake predicting a switch actually
no<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.209> knew<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.569> able<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.900> survive

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
no I knew I would be able to survive

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.320 
no I knew I would be able to survive
another<00:03:09.380> one<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.370> went<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
another one but I just went for the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.819 
another one but I just went for the
earthquake<00:03:11.660> predicting<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.140> switch<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.799> I

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
earthquake predicting a switch so I

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.140 
earthquake predicting a switch so I
don't<00:03:13.040> pretty<00:03:13.220> much<00:03:13.370> gonna<00:03:13.549> die<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.790> turn

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
don't pretty much gonna die this turn

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
don't pretty much gonna die this turn
but<00:03:14.180> I'm<00:03:14.600> gonna<00:03:14.720> go<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.049> ice<00:03:15.170> shard<00:03:15.440> but

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
but I'm gonna go for the ice shard but

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.330 
but I'm gonna go for the ice shard but
he<00:03:16.190> goes<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.269> Dothrak<00:03:17.750> again<00:03:18.620> I'm<00:03:19.010> not

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
he goes with this Dothrak again I'm not

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.099 
he goes with this Dothrak again I'm not
going<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.670> waste<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:19.910> time<00:03:20.209> boy<00:03:20.420> rapid<00:03:20.900> spin

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
going to waste my time boy rapid spin

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.640 
going to waste my time boy rapid spin
because<00:03:21.400> yeah<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.430> know<00:03:22.700> live<00:03:23.090> another

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
because yeah I know live another

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.110 
because yeah I know live another
earthquake<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:24.980> still<00:03:25.310> don't<00:03:25.549> really<00:03:25.760> care

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
earthquake but I still don't really care

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.780 
earthquake but I still don't really care
anymore<00:03:26.299> because<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.440> Moltres<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.670> was

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
anymore because I know Moltres that was

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.009 
anymore because I know Moltres that was
the<00:03:28.880> main<00:03:29.060> reason<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.420> even<00:03:29.480> went<00:03:29.750> for<00:03:29.959> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
the main reason I even went for the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.039 
the main reason I even went for the
rabbits<00:03:30.350> been<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.070> get<00:03:31.250> Moltres<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:32.540> actually

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
rabbits been to get Moltres to actually

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.890 
rabbits been to get Moltres to actually
be<00:03:33.170> sent<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.769> didn't<00:03:34.040> need<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.600> yeah

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
be sent in but I didn't need it so yeah

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.620 
be sent in but I didn't need it so yeah
so<00:03:36.620> anyways<00:03:37.130> he's<00:03:37.609> going<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.850> get<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.000> crit<00:03:38.450> on

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
so anyways he's going to get a crit on

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.539 
so anyways he's going to get a crit on
my<00:03:38.870> donphan<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.470> take<00:03:39.590> me<00:03:39.769> out<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:40.310> crib

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
my donphan and take me out the crib

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.789 
my donphan and take me out the crib
probably<00:03:41.090> did<00:03:41.420> matter<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.870> little<00:03:42.290> bit<00:03:42.560> just

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
probably did matter a little bit just

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.870 
probably did matter a little bit just
because<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.160> probably<00:03:43.430> would<00:03:43.609> have<00:03:43.670> been<00:03:43.730> able

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
because I probably would have been able

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.729 
because I probably would have been able
to<00:03:44.030> survive<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.290> little<00:03:45.500> bit<00:03:45.620> more

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
to survive and get a little bit more

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.530 
to survive and get a little bit more
damage<00:03:46.070> on<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.280> gliscor<00:03:46.730> but<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.180> guess<00:03:47.359> I<00:03:47.480> no

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
damage on this gliscor but I guess I no

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.140 
damage on this gliscor but I guess I no
longer<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.959> doesn't<00:03:48.230> matter<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:49.130> now<00:03:49.370> he's<00:03:50.030> got

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
longer it doesn't matter so now he's got

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.190 
longer it doesn't matter so now he's got
obviously<00:03:50.269> predict<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.810> fake<00:03:50.989> out<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
obviously predict the fake out the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.900 
obviously predict the fake out the
obvious<00:03:51.530> speak<00:03:51.920> out<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.280> go<00:03:52.400> back<00:03:52.579> into<00:03:52.609> his

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
obvious speak out and go back into his

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.590 
obvious speak out and go back into his
ambipom<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.959> since<00:03:54.319> Miami<00:03:54.680> palm<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.130> not<00:03:55.280> more

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
ambipom so since Miami palm is not more

ambipom so since Miami palm is not more
awesome<00:03:56.600> or<00:03:56.870> whatever<00:03:57.530> then<00:03:57.920> his<00:03:58.130> ambipom<00:03:58.430> I'm

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
awesome or whatever then his ambipom I'm

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.789 
awesome or whatever then his ambipom I'm
gonna<00:03:58.970> take<00:03:59.120> him<00:03:59.299> up<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.959> am<00:04:00.109> life<00:04:00.290> orb<00:04:00.560> so

gonna take him up and I am life orb so

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.740 
gonna take him up and I am life orb so
yeah<00:04:01.040> now<00:04:01.579> he's<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.730> going<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.060> go<00:04:02.209> into<00:04:02.510> this

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
SP on and since I max speed I know I'm

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.330 
SP on and since I max speed I know I'm
gonna<00:04:06.049> be<00:04:06.170> able<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.350> outspeed<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.829> but<00:04:07.010> he<00:04:07.160> does

focus blast or whatever on it then he

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.040 
focus blast or whatever on it then he

might probably be able to take me out

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.749 
might probably be able to take me out
but<00:04:35.740> he's<00:04:36.009> going<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.220> switch<00:04:36.400> into<00:04:36.550> his

me<00:05:34.750> because<00:05:34.930> I'll<00:05:35.110> outspeed<00:05:35.650> him<00:05:35.860> because<00:05:36.190> its

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
me because I'll outspeed him because its

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.730 
me because I'll outspeed him because its
base<00:05:36.550> speed<00:05:36.789> is<00:05:36.970> way<00:05:37.570> faster<00:05:38.050> than<00:05:38.139> Toxicroak

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
base speed is way faster than Toxicroak

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.800 
base speed is way faster than Toxicroak
and<00:05:38.949> he<00:05:39.669> doesn't<00:05:40.030> try<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.300> go<00:05:40.389> for<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.599> sucker

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
and he doesn't try to go for the sucker

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.750 
and he doesn't try to go for the sucker
punch<00:05:40.930> here<00:05:41.289> maybe<00:05:41.530> he<00:05:41.710> could<00:05:41.919> have<00:05:42.010> gotten<00:05:42.430> a

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
punch here maybe he could have gotten a

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.850 
punch here maybe he could have gotten a
crit<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.419> maybe<00:05:43.750> taking<00:05:44.050> me<00:05:44.169> out<00:05:44.289> but<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.650> guess

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
crit and maybe taking me out but I guess

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.950 
crit and maybe taking me out but I guess
that's<00:05:45.099> the<00:05:45.729> chances<00:05:46.449> for<00:05:46.479> that<00:05:46.720> or<00:05:46.810> other

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
that's the chances for that or other
