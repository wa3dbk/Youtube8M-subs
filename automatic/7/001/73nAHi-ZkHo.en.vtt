actually knows a lot about this and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.499 
actually knows a lot about this and
she's<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> nurse<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.849> at<00:02:09.149> her<00:02:09.330> Hospital

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

she's a nurse and and at her Hospital
they<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> lot<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
they actually have to do a lot to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.320 
they actually have to do a lot to
prevent

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
prevent

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.060 
prevent
septic<00:02:13.870> shock<00:02:13.900> from<00:02:14.320> from<00:02:14.620> taking<00:02:14.920> place

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
septic shock from from taking place

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.710 
septic shock from from taking place
because<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.330> those<00:02:16.420> things<00:02:16.600> where

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
because it was one of those things where

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.380 
because it was one of those things where
it<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.290> bet<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.490> was<00:02:18.610> treated<00:02:18.790> early<00:02:19.060> enough

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
it I bet if it was treated early enough

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.540 
it I bet if it was treated early enough
things<00:02:20.380> could<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.710> been<00:02:20.740> better<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.310> I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
things could have been better but I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.070 
things could have been better but I
don't<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> say<00:02:22.810> about<00:02:22.960> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.680 
and then of course we see this um but
she<00:03:15.340> was<00:03:15.490> not<00:03:15.610> able<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.910> get<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.360> feeling<00:03:16.570> back

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690

into<00:03:17.230> her<00:03:17.380> legs<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.890> guess<00:03:18.070> or<00:03:18.250> they<00:03:18.340> weren't

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
into her legs I guess or they weren't

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.040 
into her legs I guess or they weren't
able<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.850> work<00:03:19.000> everything<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:19.959> she

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
able to work everything out so she

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.870 
able to work everything out so she
actually<00:03:20.290> had<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.650> have<00:03:20.860> them<00:03:21.010> amputated

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
quite fit I mean I remember in college

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.210 
quite fit I mean I remember in college
and<00:03:27.820> whatnot<00:03:28.739> she<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:29.890> like<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and whatnot she was just like a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.580 
and whatnot she was just like a
happy-go-lucky<00:03:30.640> person<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.510> then<00:03:31.600> after<00:03:32.320> I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
happy-go-lucky person and then after I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.320 
happy-go-lucky person and then after I
left<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.100> area<00:03:33.280> she<00:03:33.700> moved<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.090> think<00:03:34.269> to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
left the area she moved I think to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.060 
left the area she moved I think to
Arizona<00:03:34.660> or<00:03:34.780> somewhere<00:03:35.019> else<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.320> then<00:03:35.890> look

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
Arizona or somewhere else and then look

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.800 
Arizona or somewhere else and then look
at<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.400> mean<00:03:36.489> she<00:03:36.700> really<00:03:36.910> went<00:03:37.600> all<00:03:37.780> out

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
at this I mean she really went all out

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.920 
at this I mean she really went all out
with<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.350> fitness<00:03:38.709> side<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.010> things<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:40.810> in

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
with the fitness side of things was in

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.330 
with the fitness side of things was in
contests<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.620> everything<00:03:41.860> like<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.010> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
contests and everything like that and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.820 
contests and everything like that and
then<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.640> is<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:43.420> current<00:03:43.900> state<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> mean

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
then this is a current state now I mean

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.470 
then this is a current state now I mean
it's<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.250> tragic<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.880> heartbreaking<00:03:46.030> to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
it's just so tragic and heartbreaking to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.590 
it's just so tragic and heartbreaking to
see<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:48.430> she<00:03:48.640> had<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.239> both<00:03:49.420> of

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
see that that she had to have both of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.870 
see that that she had to have both of
her<00:03:49.660> legs<00:03:49.720> amputated<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.950> downside<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.489> also

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
her legs amputated the downside is also

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.070 
her legs amputated the downside is also
in<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.090> reason<00:03:52.360> why<00:03:52.420> I'm<00:03:52.540> doing<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
in the reason why I'm doing this is it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.750 
in the reason why I'm doing this is it
she<00:03:53.200> didn't<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.470> medical<00:03:53.620> insurance<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.700> she

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
she didn't have medical insurance so she

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.090 
she didn't have medical insurance so she
has<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> ton<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.510> medical<00:03:56.019> bills<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.739> pay<00:03:56.890> off
