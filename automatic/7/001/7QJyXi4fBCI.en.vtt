okay yeah you know he's he's sort of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
okay yeah you know he's he's sort of
positions<00:00:50.190> himself<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.730> smartest<00:00:51.239> guy<00:00:51.390> in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
positions himself as the smartest guy in

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
positions himself as the smartest guy in
the<00:00:51.660> room<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.980> anything<00:00:53.280> goes<00:00:53.430> wrong<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the room and so if anything goes wrong I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069

think we can throw all the blame at him
I<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.070> going

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I you know this is really and it's going

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.439 
I you know this is really and it's going
to<00:00:59.280> sound<00:00:59.430> trite<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.180> sound

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to sound trite and it's gonna sound

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.170 
to sound trite and it's gonna sound
maybe<00:01:00.750> cliche<00:01:01.410> ish<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> stupid<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.670> really

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
maybe cliche ish and stupid but I really

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
believe that this is a group and a team

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.140 
believe that this is a group and a team
and<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.430> they're<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> win<00:01:05.939> together

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and that they're going to win together

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.429 
and that they're going to win together
or<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> they're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> lose<00:01:07.170> together

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
or that they're going to lose together

spoke earlier in the week about what

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.020 
spoke earlier in the week about what
might<00:02:24.140> happen<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.740> marty<00:02:25.069> turco<00:02:25.250> should

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
might happen if marty turco should

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.090 
might happen if marty turco should
struggle<00:02:26.980> marty<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.480> hasn't<00:02:29.480> played<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.170> ton

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
struggle marty is hasn't played a ton

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460 
struggle marty is hasn't played a ton
where<00:02:31.310> you'd<00:02:31.790> say<00:02:32.000> he's<00:02:32.270> been<00:02:33.050> overplayed

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
where you'd say he's been overplayed

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.260 
where you'd say he's been overplayed
going<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> playoffs<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.520> he's<00:02:34.700> fresh<00:02:35.000> and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
going in the playoffs so he's fresh and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.360 
going in the playoffs so he's fresh and
I<00:02:35.750> think<00:02:35.810> Mike<00:02:36.170> Smith<00:02:36.650> has<00:02:36.830> proved<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.220> he's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
I think Mike Smith has proved that he's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.699 
I think Mike Smith has proved that he's
ready<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.730> play<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.410> good<00:02:39.560> scenario

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
ready to play and that's a good scenario

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.740 
ready to play and that's a good scenario
for<00:02:40.010> us<00:02:40.100> if<00:02:40.459> coach<00:02:40.670> Tippett<00:02:41.030> decides<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.569> play

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
for us if coach Tippett decides to play

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.660 
for us if coach Tippett decides to play
the<00:02:41.959> other<00:02:42.110> goalie<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.250> game<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.610> a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
the other goalie in a game in a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970 
the other goalie in a game in a
postseason<00:02:44.000> you'd<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.570> okay<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.230> now

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
postseason you'd be okay with that now

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.009 
postseason you'd be okay with that now
we'll<00:02:46.519> worry<00:02:46.700> about<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:47.120> wasn't<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.630> time

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
that there'll be any other goalie than

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.030 
that there'll be any other goalie than
then<00:03:17.150> Marty<00:03:17.480> Turco<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.590> playoffs<00:03:18.920> this

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
then Marty Turco in the playoffs this

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.830 
then Marty Turco in the playoffs this
year<00:03:19.100> for<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.400> Dallas<00:03:19.700> Stars<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.090> really<00:03:20.630> don't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
year for the Dallas Stars I really don't

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
people expect it will be and I think he

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.979 
people expect it will be and I think he
will<00:03:24.410> earn<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:25.000> against<00:03:26.000> Roberto<00:03:26.480> Luongo

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
will earn that against Roberto Luongo
