00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
kind of like a thicker viscosity for

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.120 
kind of like a thicker viscosity for
sure<00:04:27.110> which<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.230> why<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.380> say<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.620> like<00:04:28.860> kind

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
sure which is why I say it's like kind

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
sure which is why I say it's like kind
of<00:04:29.190> like<00:04:29.250> Stewart<00:04:29.790> but<00:04:29.940> without<00:04:30.090> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
of like Stewart but without the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.600 
of like Stewart but without the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
stickiness maybe there's like really as

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.840 
stickiness maybe there's like really as
like<00:04:35.610> thick<00:04:35.970> water<00:04:36.390> I<00:04:36.540> guess<00:04:37.190> yeah<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.640> like

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850

the fruit the fruit basket flavor very
akin<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.390> what<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.780> get<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.320> lot<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.500> like

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
akin to what you get in a lot of like

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.310 
akin to what you get in a lot of like

this is this is through the roof
compared<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.140> those<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:05.280> could<00:05:05.580> probably<00:05:06.000> I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
compared to those you could probably I

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.260 
compared to those you could probably I
mean<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> problem<00:05:07.440> call<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.680> walkable<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:09.120> it's

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
mean a problem call it walkable but it's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.640
