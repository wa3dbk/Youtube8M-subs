00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:20.290
 so look here I already have two hammers and 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.600
 tree chili depends on what 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.029
 want is what they are going to put 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.700
 chiles this us if we like a 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.390
 little bit spicy then if I put this 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.530
 pretty and right now I have it to the stove 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.629
 medium-high fire and in five minutes the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.540
 I'm going to turn off and I'm going to cover this so that 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.450
 is finished baking with steam 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.670
 and then look here it's already boiling and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.790
 now I'm going to turn off to insult so much 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 light or gas if you use gas only five 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.550
 minutes hard and already boiled over high heat 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.470
 medium high and now what I'm going to do is 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.700
 so that they finish cooking I'm going to 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.490
 cover 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.820
 This is your cover and I'm going to leave you 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.820
 little 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.189
 and well, as you can see after 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.659
 half hour that was what I already left 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.749
 are the chiles 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.700
 and the tomatoes are cooked and now what 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:19.299
 let's do is grind them in the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.299
 blender 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.630
 look here I already have the blenders the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.469
 things what I'm going to occupy is low 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.640
 medium and the secret to this sauce is 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.490
 Oregano is added a little oregano more 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 or less about two visits 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.979
 and obvious the salt that we are going to put 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.520
 it depends on how salty you are 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.820
 you're going to sar and that's all we're going to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.820
 Grind 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.160
 and well that way our sauce is very rich 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.470
 either explicit nor we want is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 so light and I hope you liked it 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.160
