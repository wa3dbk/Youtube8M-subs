00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.539 

in<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.730> fashion

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 

now<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.240> doesn't<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.780> perfect<00:01:52.259> or

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
now this doesn't have to be perfect or

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.080 
now this doesn't have to be perfect or
even<00:01:52.560> 100<00:01:52.950> us<00:01:53.009> incomplete<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> hem

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
even 100 us incomplete in the hem

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.719 
even 100 us incomplete in the hem
actually<00:01:54.780> create<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> shape<00:01:55.439> walk<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
actually create the shape walk so this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.690 
actually create the shape walk so this
is<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.030> enough<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> basic<00:01:58.700> idea

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
is just enough just to get a basic idea

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.880 
is just enough just to get a basic idea
and<00:02:00.090> how<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.329> wanted<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> do

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.800 

okay<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.670> how<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.850> basically<00:02:07.300> won<00:02:07.630> it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
okay so this is how I basically won it

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.410 
okay so this is how I basically won it
so<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:08.950> not<00:02:08.979> completely<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so I know it's not completely in in the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.420 
so I know it's not completely in in the
bun<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:10.929> that's<00:02:11.650> where<00:02:11.890> they<00:02:11.980> hearing<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.340> is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
bun but that's where they hearing it is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.260 
bun but that's where they hearing it is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
going to help me so I take the hairnet

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.850 
again using an elastic hearing that they
sell<00:02:19.030> ones<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.720> don't<00:02:19.870> have<00:02:20.020> elastic<00:02:20.650> but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
sell ones that don't have elastic but

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.220 
sell ones that don't have elastic but
elastic<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:22.450> important<00:02:22.870> when<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.050> comes

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
elastic it's so important when it comes

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.180

you use the remaining part of that hair

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:19.220 
you use the remaining part of that hair
net<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> wrap<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.920> around<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:04.140> make<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.890> secure

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.060 

and<00:03:20.230> that's<00:03:20.440> pretty<00:03:20.650> much<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.910> can<00:03:22.240> use

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
and that's pretty much it you can use

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
and that's pretty much it you can use
you<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.340> use<00:03:25.920> hair<00:03:26.920> pins<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.580> like<00:03:27.760> make<00:03:28.060> it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
you can use hair pins to like make it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.880 
you can use hair pins to like make it
more<00:03:28.270> secure<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.110> if<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.740> right

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
more secure but if you do it the right

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.250 
more secure but if you do it the right
way<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.880> really<00:03:31.210> wouldn't<00:03:31.570> need<00:03:31.870> any

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
way you really wouldn't need any

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.650 
way you really wouldn't need any
additional<00:03:32.590> pens<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.730> has<00:03:33.940> longer<00:03:34.240> you<00:03:34.480> may

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
additional pens it has longer you may

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.440 
additional pens it has longer you may
need<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.110> few<00:03:35.680> more<00:03:35.860> pins<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:36.850> that's<00:03:37.150> pretty

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
need a few more pins but that's pretty

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.770 
need a few more pins but that's pretty
much<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.960> so<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.940> very<00:03:39.970> simplest<00:03:40.480> hair

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
much in it so it's a very simplest hair

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.480 
much in it so it's a very simplest hair
so<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:40.960> used<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.230> see<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.470> takes<00:03:41.740> me<00:03:41.890> seconds<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
so I used to see it takes me seconds to

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.390 
so I used to see it takes me seconds to
do<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:44.230> can<00:03:44.380> dress<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.190> put
