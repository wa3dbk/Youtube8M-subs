the intimidation factor works for your
character<00:03:13.040> I'll<00:03:13.250> give<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.360> have<00:03:14.510> a

mean you hit someone it's gonna lower
their<00:03:19.220> stats<00:03:19.580> slightly<00:03:20.739> because<00:03:21.940> they<00:03:22.940> got

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
their stats slightly because they got

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.390 
their stats slightly because they got
they<00:03:23.930> were<00:03:23.989> aware<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.709> hit<00:03:24.950> them<00:03:25.160> and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
they were aware that you hit them and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.729 
they were aware that you hit them and
then<00:03:25.549> they're<00:03:25.730> gonna<00:03:25.790> be<00:03:26.000> there<00:03:26.959> skater<00:03:27.200> stats

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
then they're gonna be there skater stats

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.710 
then they're gonna be there skater stats
are<00:03:27.920> gonna<00:03:28.010> slightly<00:03:28.549> decrease<00:03:29.000> not<00:03:29.330> very

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
are gonna slightly decrease not very

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.759 
are gonna slightly decrease not very
noticeable<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.400> definitely<00:03:31.640> there

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
noticeable but it's definitely there

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.620 
noticeable but it's definitely there
defensive<00:03:33.769> awareness<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:35.060> increases<00:03:35.600> the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
defensive awareness it increases the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.699 
defensive awareness it increases the

likelihood that you'll be able to
intercept<00:03:37.070> your<00:03:37.220> passes<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:39.140> basically<00:03:39.470> you

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
intercept your passes so basically you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.530 
intercept your passes so basically you
can<00:03:39.680> stop<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.950> cross<00:03:40.130> crease<00:03:40.370> passes<00:03:40.880> an<00:03:41.359> year

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
can stop the cross crease passes an year

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.539 
can stop the cross crease passes an year
ago<00:03:41.780> it'll<00:03:42.260> also<00:03:42.380> be<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:42.859> good<00:03:43.040> with<00:03:43.310> your

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.420 
but I don't really take it as it's not
gonna<00:06:21.389> happen<00:06:21.599> every<00:06:22.349> single<00:06:22.379> game<00:06:24.169> endurance

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
gonna happen every single game endurance

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.749 
gonna happen every single game endurance
once<00:06:26.430> again<00:06:27.289> it's<00:06:28.289> just<00:06:28.710> this<00:06:29.520> is<00:06:29.580> a

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
once again it's just this is a

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.820 
once again it's just this is a
likelihood<00:06:30.240> if<00:06:30.689> you<00:06:31.469> have<00:06:31.589> a<00:06:31.620> higher

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
likelihood if you have a higher

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.040 
likelihood if you have a higher
endurance<00:06:32.520> then<00:06:33.060> your<00:06:33.210> character<00:06:33.479> is<00:06:33.629> going

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
endurance then your character is going

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.339 
endurance then your character is going
to<00:06:34.259> lose<00:06:35.009> his<00:06:35.159> energy<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.490> lot<00:06:35.719> slower<00:06:36.719> if<00:06:37.229> you

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
to lose his energy a lot slower if you

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.510 
to lose his energy a lot slower if you
have<00:06:37.439> slower<00:06:37.710> endurance<00:06:38.129> your<00:06:38.219> guy's<00:06:38.370> gonna

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
have slower endurance your guy's gonna

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.510 
have slower endurance your guy's gonna
run<00:06:38.669> out<00:06:38.759> of<00:06:38.789> speed<00:06:39.500> maybe<00:06:40.500> shorter<00:06:41.370> than

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
run out of speed maybe shorter than

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.149 
run out of speed maybe shorter than
halfway<00:06:41.699> through<00:06:41.849> peer<00:06:42.240> in<00:06:42.389> the<00:06:42.479> nation<00:06:42.750> we

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
halfway through peer in the nation we

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.829 
halfway through peer in the nation we
going<00:06:44.159> around<00:06:44.339> the<00:06:44.460> eyes<00:06:44.580> not<00:06:45.449> being<00:06:45.629> able<00:06:45.719> to

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:45.839 
going around the eyes not being able to

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.300 
going around the eyes not being able to
catch<00:06:45.930> up<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.139> people<00:06:46.469> getting<00:06:46.830> caught<00:06:47.370> and

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
catch up to people getting caught and

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.990 
catch up to people getting caught and
so<00:06:49.060> endurance<00:06:49.690> is<00:06:49.780> a<00:06:49.870> good<00:06:50.020> thing<00:06:50.140> to<00:06:50.260> have

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
so endurance is a good thing to have

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.240 
so endurance is a good thing to have
speed<00:06:52.200> once<00:06:53.200> you<00:06:53.350> get<00:06:53.530> your<00:06:53.740> acceleration

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
speed once you get your acceleration

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.640 
speed once you get your acceleration
speed<00:06:54.760> is<00:06:55.030> feed<00:06:55.540> will<00:06:55.690> take<00:06:55.870> over<00:06:56.050> and<00:06:56.320> it'll

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
speed is feed will take over and it'll

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.030 
speed is feed will take over and it'll
control<00:06:56.980> how<00:06:57.430> fast<00:06:57.610> you're<00:06:57.850> going<00:06:57.880> and<00:06:59.040> you'll

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
control how fast you're going and you'll

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.500 
control how fast you're going and you'll
be<00:07:00.160> able<00:07:00.220> to<00:07:00.340> beat<00:07:00.550> out<00:07:00.580> the<00:07:00.910> escape<00:07:01.210> the

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
be able to beat out the escape the

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.200 
be able to beat out the escape the
defenders<00:07:02.050> and<00:07:02.260> go<00:07:02.530> right<00:07:02.680> past<00:07:02.710> them<00:07:03.130> this<00:07:04.030> is

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
defenders and go right past them this is

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.460 
defenders and go right past them this is
another<00:07:04.360> thing<00:07:04.660> for<00:07:04.990> some<00:07:05.140> reason<00:07:05.410> the

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
another thing for some reason the

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.990 
another thing for some reason the
grinder<00:07:05.770> as<00:07:05.890> the<00:07:05.980> highest<00:07:06.130> speed<00:07:06.490> we<00:07:06.700> get<00:07:06.910> up

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
grinder as the highest speed we get up

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.410 
grinder as the highest speed we get up
to<00:07:07.060> like<00:07:07.150> 95<00:07:07.690> and<00:07:08.050> 95<00:07:08.380> acceleration<00:07:09.420> doesn't

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
to like 95 and 95 acceleration doesn't

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.690 
to like 95 and 95 acceleration doesn't
make<00:07:10.540> sense<00:07:10.720> but<00:07:10.930> it<00:07:11.350> happens<00:07:11.890> and<00:07:13.590> strength

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 
make sense but it happens and strength

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.120 
make sense but it happens and strength
this<00:07:15.700> is<00:07:15.970> the<00:07:16.810> effects<00:07:17.710> when<00:07:17.890> you're<00:07:18.010> putting

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
this is the effects when you're putting

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.610 
this is the effects when you're putting
up<00:07:18.250> grounds<00:07:18.700> on<00:07:18.910> the<00:07:19.090> boards<00:07:19.420> how<00:07:20.170> effective

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
up grounds on the boards how effective

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.130 
up grounds on the boards how effective
it<00:07:20.710> is<00:07:20.740> how<00:07:21.070> much<00:07:21.400> it<00:07:21.580> can<00:07:21.670> get<00:07:21.850> away<00:07:22.120> and<00:07:22.690> then

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
it is how much it can get away and then

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.360 
it is how much it can get away and then
when<00:07:23.320> you're<00:07:23.440> put<00:07:23.620> on<00:07:23.710> the<00:07:23.800> board<00:07:23.920> also<00:07:24.160> how

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
when you're put on the board also how

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.310 
when you're put on the board also how
much<00:07:24.490> you<00:07:24.640> can<00:07:24.760> get<00:07:24.820> away<00:07:24.940> this<00:07:25.750> also<00:07:26.020> works

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
much you can get away this also works

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.310 
much you can get away this also works
with<00:07:26.500> the<00:07:26.620> shots<00:07:26.890> on<00:07:27.360> how<00:07:28.360> fast<00:07:28.600> your<00:07:28.960> shot<00:07:29.170> is

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
with the shots on how fast your shot is

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.020 
with the shots on how fast your shot is
going<00:07:29.470> to<00:07:29.560> come<00:07:29.680> in<00:07:29.890> if<00:07:30.610> you've<00:07:30.790> a<00:07:30.850> higher

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
going to come in if you've a higher

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.490 
going to come in if you've a higher
strength<00:07:31.360> your<00:07:31.690> shot<00:07:31.900> will<00:07:32.050> come<00:07:32.170> in<00:07:32.290> maybe

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
strength your shot will come in maybe

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.680 
strength your shot will come in maybe
two<00:07:33.280> or<00:07:33.310> three<00:07:33.520> mile<00:07:33.790> an<00:07:33.880> hour<00:07:33.940> fast<00:07:34.330> or<00:07:34.570> on<00:07:34.660> a

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
two or three mile an hour fast or on a

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.630 
two or three mile an hour fast or on a
wrist<00:07:34.930> shot<00:07:34.990> and<00:07:35.350> slap<00:07:35.560> shots<00:07:35.830> maybe<00:07:36.070> up<00:07:36.580> to

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:36.640 
wrist shot and slap shots maybe up to

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.820 
wrist shot and slap shots maybe up to
five<00:07:37.000> min<00:07:37.210> hour<00:07:37.360> which<00:07:37.600> does<00:07:38.380> play<00:07:38.590> a<00:07:38.620> big<00:07:38.680> role

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 
five min hour which does play a big role

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.940 
five min hour which does play a big role
and<00:07:39.480> then<00:07:40.480> it<00:07:40.990> also<00:07:41.170> affects<00:07:41.560> your<00:07:41.740> hitting

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950 
and then it also affects your hitting

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.520 
and then it also affects your hitting
power<00:07:42.130> and<00:07:42.520> how<00:07:43.390> like<00:07:44.050> when<00:07:44.170> you<00:07:44.230> hit<00:07:44.350> someone

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
power and how like when you hit someone

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.760 
power and how like when you hit someone
they<00:07:44.770> like<00:07:44.890> that<00:07:45.070> they're<00:07:45.310> going<00:07:45.400> to<00:07:45.460> fall<00:07:45.700> and

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:46.770 
they like that they're going to fall and

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.080 
they like that they're going to fall and
when<00:07:47.770> you're<00:07:47.890> fighting<00:07:48.100> you<00:07:48.550> can<00:07:48.670> use<00:07:48.820> it<00:07:48.850> for

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.090 
when you're fighting you can use it for

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.820 
when you're fighting you can use it for
it<00:07:49.510> also<00:07:49.690> affects<00:07:50.020> your<00:07:50.140> punching<00:07:50.500> on<00:07:50.650> how

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830 
it also affects your punching on how

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.460 
it also affects your punching on how
hard<00:07:51.250> how<00:07:52.060> much<00:07:52.210> more<00:07:52.510> effective<00:07:52.900> it<00:07:52.990> is<00:07:53.020> then

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.470 
hard how much more effective it is then

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.370 
hard how much more effective it is then
went<00:07:54.280> like<00:07:54.430> when<00:07:54.580> you're<00:07:54.700> fighting<00:07:54.820> someone

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 
went like when you're fighting someone

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.110 
went like when you're fighting someone
all<00:07:56.380> right<00:07:56.530> everybody<00:07:56.760> thank<00:07:57.760> you<00:07:57.820> for<00:07:58.030> this

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.410 
one I'm just doing a quick over cap for

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.310 
one I'm just doing a quick over cap for
what<00:08:02.620> the<00:08:02.800> attributes<00:08:03.310> are<00:08:03.460> for<00:08:03.850> the<00:08:04.320> skaters

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320 
what the attributes are for the skaters

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.680 
what the attributes are for the skaters
in<00:08:05.470> my<00:08:06.220> next<00:08:06.430> video<00:08:06.730> I'll<00:08:06.850> be<00:08:06.880> going<00:08:07.180> over<00:08:07.300> what

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:07.690 
in my next video I'll be going over what

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.390 
in my next video I'll be going over what
the<00:08:07.780> goalie<00:08:08.080> attributes<00:08:08.590> are<00:08:08.740> and<00:08:08.980> what<00:08:09.220> those
