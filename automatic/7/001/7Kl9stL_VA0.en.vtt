camera<00:00:10.160> dancing<00:00:11.160> singing<00:00:11.400> acting<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.880> just

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
camera dancing singing acting I just

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.310

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
knew that I wanted to be on stage
performing<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.580> doubted<00:00:15.389> myself<00:00:15.660> along

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
performing and I doubted myself along
