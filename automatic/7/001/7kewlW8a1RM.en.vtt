00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
screen ready here because it really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
screen ready here because it really
doesn't<00:00:56.160> pop<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.670> high<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.859> actually

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
doesn't pop very high so we're actually

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
doesn't pop very high so we're actually
able<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> without<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.090> lid<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.629> pot

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
able to do this without a lid on the pot

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
able to do this without a lid on the pot
but<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.350> splatter<00:01:01.649> screen<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.160> always<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> good

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
but a splatter screen is always a good

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.810 
but a splatter screen is always a good
idea<00:01:02.670> mostly<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> avoid<00:01:04.710> burns<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
idea mostly just to avoid burns from the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
idea mostly just to avoid burns from the
oil<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.140> what<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.070> glove<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> my

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
oil which is what I have my glove on my

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
oil which is what I have my glove on my
star<00:01:09.150> hand<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.799> soon<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> starts

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
star hand and as soon as it starts

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.950 
star hand and as soon as it starts
popping<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> turn<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.659> stove
