a<00:00:30.040> cool<00:00:30.250> dry<00:00:30.460> shirt<00:00:30.730> on<00:00:30.939> way<00:00:31.509> over<00:00:32.290> time<00:00:32.500> last

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
a cool dry shirt on way over time last

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.540 
a cool dry shirt on way over time last
couple<00:00:33.130> of<00:00:33.160> months

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
couple of months

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.549 
couple of months
you<00:00:33.790> know<00:00:33.880> cold<00:00:34.420> started<00:00:34.840> being<00:00:34.960> not<00:00:35.170> so<00:00:35.380> cold

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
you know cold started being not so cold

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.049 
you know cold started being not so cold
anymore<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.130> now<00:00:36.219> it's<00:00:36.399> just<00:00:36.489> kind<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.790> warm

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
anymore and now it's just kind of warm

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.390 
anymore and now it's just kind of warm
so<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:37.989> probably<00:00:38.200> got<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.590> leak<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.160> system

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
so it probably got a leak in the system

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.540 
so it probably got a leak in the system
so<00:00:40.150> we<00:00:40.300> can<00:00:40.330> go<00:00:40.540> through<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:41.110> you<00:00:41.320> know

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so we can go through and you know

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.100 
so we can go through and you know
repressurize<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.970> see<00:00:43.540> if<00:00:43.630> we<00:00:43.750> can<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:43.990> know

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
repressurize and see if we can you know

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.050 
repressurize and see if we can you know
contain<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.740> leak<00:00:45.010> or<00:00:45.250> if<00:00:45.610> we<00:00:45.670> got<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.850> major

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
contain that leak or if we got a major

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.270 
contain that leak or if we got a major

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
you there's so many places where these

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.240

things can leak there's like 50 no rings
all<00:01:12.460> kinds<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.880> stuff<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.390> that's<00:01:13.630> why<00:01:13.810> these

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
all kinds of stuff and that's why these

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.350 
all kinds of stuff and that's why these
guys<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.290> AC<00:01:14.500> Pro<00:01:14.950> came<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.880> not<00:01:16.060> only<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
guys that AC Pro came up with not only a

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.630 
guys that AC Pro came up with not only a
really<00:01:16.690> wicked<00:01:17.020> coolant<00:01:17.620> but<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.010> also<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.580> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
really wicked coolant but it also is a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.580 
really wicked coolant but it also is a
rubber<00:01:19.060> conditioner<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:19.870> it<00:01:19.960> goes<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.320> and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
rubber conditioner so it goes in and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.160 
rubber conditioner so it goes in and
helps<00:01:21.070> seal<00:01:21.280> those<00:01:21.460> o-rings<00:01:21.729> yeah<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.020> AC

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
helps seal those o-rings yeah so the AC

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.200 
helps seal those o-rings yeah so the AC
system<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.860> just<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.130> big<00:01:24.310> loop<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.670> refrigerant

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
system is just a big loop of refrigerant

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.539 
system is just a big loop of refrigerant
but<00:01:25.659> you<00:01:25.780> got<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> compressor<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.650> there<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.070> on

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
but you got a compressor in there and on

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.399 
but you got a compressor in there and on
one<00:01:27.760> side<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.120> compressor<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.810> an<00:01:29.140> orifice

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
one side of the compressor is an orifice

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.020 
one side of the compressor is an orifice
so<00:01:29.680> you're<00:01:29.799> backing<00:01:30.370> it<00:01:30.460> up<00:01:30.549> once<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:30.850> kick

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
so you're backing it up once you kick

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.940 
so you're backing it up once you kick
that<00:01:31.060> thing<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.630> you're<00:01:32.140> pushing<00:01:32.560> freon

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that thing on you're pushing freon

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.880 
that thing on you're pushing freon
against<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.370> orifice<00:01:33.880> or<00:01:34.120> TXV<00:01:34.570> valve<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.229> on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
against the orifice or TXV valve and on

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.469 
against the orifice or TXV valve and on
the<00:01:36.040> other<00:01:36.190> side<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> compressor<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.240> a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
the other side of the compressor is a

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.690 
the other side of the compressor is a
low<00:01:37.840> side<00:01:38.200> you're<00:01:38.470> pulling<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.950> vacuum<00:01:39.490> so

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
low side you're pulling a vacuum so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160 
low side you're pulling a vacuum so
that's<00:01:39.880> what<00:01:40.090> we're<00:01:40.210> going<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.390> tap<00:01:40.630> into<00:01:41.020> is

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
that's what we're going to tap into is

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.840 
that's what we're going to tap into is
that<00:01:41.320> low<00:01:41.560> side<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.220> I'm<00:01:42.280> gonna<00:01:42.400> fire<00:01:42.640> this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
that low side and I'm gonna fire this

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.520 
that low side and I'm gonna fire this
thing<00:01:42.909> up<00:01:43.299> so<00:01:43.360> we<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.750> get<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.930> system<00:01:44.290> run

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
thing up so we can get the system run

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230 
thing up so we can get the system run
and<00:01:44.770> see<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.400> kind<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.610> system<00:01:46.000> pressure

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and see what kind of system pressure

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.450 
and see what kind of system pressure
we're<00:01:46.540> looking<00:01:46.869> at<00:01:47.020> hey<00:01:47.440> check<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:48.010> out<00:01:48.220> this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
we're looking at hey check this out this

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.940 
we're looking at hey check this out this
is<00:01:48.520> kind<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:48.880> cool<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.720> little<00:01:50.049> port<00:01:50.710> right

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
is kind of cool this little port right

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.740 
is kind of cool this little port right
here<00:01:51.159> if<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.340> will<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.729> only<00:01:52.270> thing<00:01:52.540> that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
here if you will the only thing that

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.899 
here if you will the only thing that
this<00:01:52.960> thing<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.380> snap<00:01:53.680> on<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.979> underneath<00:01:54.670> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
this thing can snap on to underneath the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.730 
this thing can snap on to underneath the
entire<00:01:55.270> hood<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.570> your<00:01:55.600> car<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:56.380> there's<00:01:56.560> no

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
entire hood of your car is there's no

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.130 
entire hood of your car is there's no
poor<00:01:57.040> side<00:01:57.340> all<00:01:58.090> right<00:01:58.150> man<00:01:58.510> give<00:01:58.990> me<00:01:59.020> some

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
poor side all right man give me some

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.780 
poor side all right man give me some
heat

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.330 

so<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.120> have<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.570> connected<00:02:03.110> right<00:02:03.320> there<00:02:03.620> so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
so you have it connected right there so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.620 
so you have it connected right there so
that's<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.700> give<00:02:04.790> us<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:05.030> reading<00:02:05.240> in<00:02:05.510> a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's going to give us a reading in a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.190 
that's going to give us a reading in a
second

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
second

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200 
second
and<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.620> really<00:02:06.890> cool<00:02:07.040> thing<00:02:07.250> about<00:02:07.550> this<00:02:07.850> as

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
and a really cool thing about this as

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.790 
and a really cool thing about this as
you<00:02:08.390> could<00:02:08.540> set<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> temperature<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.500> here

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
you could set the temperature and here

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.310 
you could set the temperature and here
it's<00:02:09.920> about<00:02:09.979> 72<00:02:10.760> degrees<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> roll<00:02:12.020> up<00:02:12.140> here

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's about 72 degrees so we roll up here

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.180 
it's about 72 degrees so we roll up here
set<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.890> about<00:02:13.070> 72<00:02:13.700> degrees<00:02:14.210> see<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.230> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
set it to about 72 degrees see that and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.700 
set it to about 72 degrees see that and
then<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.760> basically<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.540> trigger<00:02:17.810> see

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
then it's basically just a trigger see

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.200 
then it's basically just a trigger see
that<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.430> hooked<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> low

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
that we have it hooked up to the low

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.240 
that we have it hooked up to the low
port<00:02:20.510> side<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.590> ready<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.950> squeeze

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
port side and you're ready to squeeze

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
port side and you're ready to squeeze
check<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.000> up

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.020 

now<00:02:26.530> when<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.770> let<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.550> see<00:02:27.910> it's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
now when we let go of that you see it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.080 
now when we let go of that you see it's
filling<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> up<00:02:28.770> he's<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> little<00:02:30.070> more<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.490> 72

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
filling it up he's a little more at 72

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.520 
filling it up he's a little more at 72
degrees<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.510> want<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.750> get<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.410> around

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
degrees we want to get it in and around

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.380 
degrees we want to get it in and around
the<00:02:32.860> green<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:33.970> let<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.210> of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the green up here so when you let go of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.890 
the green up here so when you let go of
the<00:02:34.450> trigger

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
the trigger

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.270 
the trigger
as<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.380> see<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.950> needle<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.430> climbing

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
as you can see that needle is climbing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240 
as you can see that needle is climbing
filling<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.580> AFC<00:02:40.000> we're<00:02:40.240> gonna<00:02:40.330> get<00:02:40.540> Jade

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
filling up this AFC we're gonna get Jade

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.460 
filling up this AFC we're gonna get Jade
to<00:02:42.250> clean<00:02:42.700> dry<00:02:43.090> shirts<00:02:43.510> look<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.290> we're

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
to clean dry shirts look at that we're

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.760 
to clean dry shirts look at that we're
already<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> green<00:02:45.190> dryer<00:02:45.960> feel<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:47.140> start

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
already in the green dryer feel it start

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.790 
already in the green dryer feel it start
to<00:02:47.800> feel<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.160> yeah<00:02:48.460> all<00:02:49.270> right<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.440> have

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
to feel it yeah all right so now we have

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.230 
to feel it yeah all right so now we have
refrigerant<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.580> system<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:52.060> can

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
refrigerant in the system that can

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.780 
refrigerant in the system that can
actually<00:02:52.390> do<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:52.960> supposed<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.440> do<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
actually do what it's supposed to do and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.370 
actually do what it's supposed to do and
because<00:02:55.660> we've<00:02:55.810> got<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
because we've got you know the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.780 
because we've got you know the
conditioners<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.100> there<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.580> kind<00:02:57.760> of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
conditioners in there we can kind of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.250 
conditioners in there we can kind of
tighten<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.300> lot<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.540> those<00:02:58.660> little<00:02:58.990> seals

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
tighten up a lot of those little seals

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.050 
tighten up a lot of those little seals
now<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.160> you've<00:03:00.280> got<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.460> bigger<00:03:00.790> league

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
now if you've got a bigger league

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.700 
now if you've got a bigger league
typically<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.110> know<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.530> rubber

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
typically not you know one of the rubber

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.590 
typically not you know one of the rubber
components<00:03:03.190> maybe<00:03:03.970> you've<00:03:04.180> got<00:03:04.390> some

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
components maybe you've got some

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.880 
components maybe you've got some
corrosion<00:03:04.930> happening<00:03:05.500> inside<00:03:05.740> your

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
corrosion happening inside your

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
corrosion happening inside your
condenser<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:06.370> evaporator<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:07.960> use<00:03:08.110> a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
condenser or evaporator you can use a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.740 
condenser or evaporator you can use a
super<00:03:08.710> seal<00:03:08.920> now<00:03:09.460> super<00:03:09.910> seals<00:03:10.150> what<00:03:10.450> they<00:03:10.570> use

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
super seal now super seals what they use
