00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.290
 Dear boys and girls 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.950
 What ever 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 I will Carsten Schatz why 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.609
 one or the other may know me 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.609
 I consider these may be many 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.009
 I love to lick the world through the bottom of a glass all the time 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.199
 unimportant 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.759
 Deutschmann may also have heard rumors that Jack Sparrow 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.500
 a crew adjusts 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.600
 Not everyone has leaked to the source of youth from the port 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.470
 but not the truth either 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.470
 Would you not want to be there, or maybe Red? 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.010
 worth twice 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.310
 only on our way 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.510
 the huge New Yorker 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 during an expedition 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.650
 as they say 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.960
 Jack Sparrow 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 Optimized was not rewarded that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.440
 Read here how it works 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 Windows and doors open 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.939
 the search for the source of eternal youth 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.139
 It would not be a good idea to check the source for good 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 that was really necessary 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.289
 it's about the source 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.289
 were allowed with us the way 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.460
 The 1 when we called that meant only twelve weeks over the ship 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.560
 Judge is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 and I would make that up 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 what was happening 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200
 the journey is driven many 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 first 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.880
 Dr 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 eight armed pirates 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.550
 the deadly shots 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 amazing 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.839
 all that 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.759
 Mr. Lacher 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.119
 that he is no longer there 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.420
 this had to be shown in the course of the tightened supervision now 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.420
 many us citizens are not 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.719
 Fri. 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.719
 Franziska KÃ¶hler emphasized Kurth 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.219
 the castle itself 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.519
 Hannah's all seen because I rewrite the net why he
