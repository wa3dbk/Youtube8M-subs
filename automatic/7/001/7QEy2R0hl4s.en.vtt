00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.670 
um so real quickly let me get into the
two<00:00:16.199> updates<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> got<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.539> um<00:00:18.680> okay

two updates that I got going on um okay
so<00:00:19.820> not<00:00:20.820> too<00:00:21.060> long<00:00:21.240> ago<00:00:21.300> probably<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.289> week<00:00:22.439> or

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so not too long ago probably a week or

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
so not too long ago probably a week or
so<00:00:22.800> ago<00:00:22.830> there<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> program<00:00:24.330> called<00:00:24.600> raw

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so ago there was a program called raw

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.380 
so ago there was a program called raw
flash<00:00:25.230> version<00:00:25.949> 2<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.640> released<00:00:27.060> well

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
flash version 2 that was released well

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.839 
flash version 2 that was released well
as<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:28.410> there's<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> program<00:00:29.189> called<00:00:29.460> raw

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
as of now there's a program called raw

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.380 
as of now there's a program called raw
flash<00:00:30.179> version<00:00:30.539> 3<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.700> it's<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> basic

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
flash version 3 and it's just a basic

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
flash version 3 and it's just a basic
update<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.350> too<00:00:34.559> much<00:00:34.680> new<00:00:34.890> stuff<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.430> main

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
update not too much new stuff the main

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.990 
update not too much new stuff the main
thing<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.800> fix<00:00:38.280> bad<00:00:38.610> block

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
thing is that they fix bad block

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
thing is that they fix bad block
skipping<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> skips<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.559> both<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> dump

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
skipping so it skips it in both the dump

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.389 
skipping so it skips it in both the dump
and<00:00:41.280> flash<00:00:41.550> instead<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> dump<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
and flash instead of just in a dump so I

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
and flash instead of just in a dump so I
guess<00:00:44.399> before<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.910> having<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.329> errors

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
guess before they're having some errors

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
guess before they're having some errors
with<00:00:46.260> certain<00:00:46.620> parts<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> dumping<00:00:47.640> or

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
with certain parts of you to dumping or

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.810 
with certain parts of you to dumping or
flashing<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> through<00:00:48.870> Excel<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.820> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
flashing in and through Excel and now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
flashing in and through Excel and now
i'm<00:00:51.120> guessing<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> seems<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> should<00:00:52.620> be

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
i'm guessing it seems like it should be

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
i'm guessing it seems like it should be
all<00:00:52.860> cleaned<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.480> having<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> chance<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
all cleaned up having got a chance to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
all cleaned up having got a chance to
try<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.289> yet<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.770> hopefully<00:00:55.949> once<00:00:56.820> i<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.059> my

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
added folder pre-selection to save as
browse<00:01:16.350> dialogue<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> added

browse dialogue as well as I added

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
browse dialogue as well as I added
command-line<00:01:19.140> parsing<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> open<00:01:20.250> an<00:01:20.340> iso<00:01:20.820> from

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
command-line parsing to open an iso from

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240 
command-line parsing to open an iso from
explorer<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.780> guess<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.590> open<00:01:22.950> highest

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
explorer so i guess you can open highest

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
explorer so i guess you can open highest
those<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.670> command<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.240> command<00:01:24.509> upon

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
those with command or command upon

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
those with command or command upon
something<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.970> okay<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
something like that okay so for the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
something like that okay so for the
