little tour it is a little bit bigger
than<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:17.970> project<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.770> 8

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
than our first project it is about 8

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.820 
than our first project it is about 8
feet<00:00:20.189> long<00:00:20.250> almost<00:00:21.210> 8<00:00:21.359> feet<00:00:21.570> by<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:21.990> 5<00:00:22.590> feet

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
feet long almost 8 feet by about 5 feet

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.240 
feet long almost 8 feet by about 5 feet
wide

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
wide

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.689 
wide
each<00:00:24.740> levels<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.949> divide<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> into<00:00:26.430> two<00:00:26.670> equal

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
each levels can divide it into two equal

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.380 
each levels can divide it into two equal
spaces<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.310> lots<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.490> room<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:29.970> rabbits

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
spaces and lots of room for our rabbits

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.810 
spaces and lots of room for our rabbits
to<00:00:30.710> enjoy<00:00:31.710> themselves<00:00:31.920> run<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> play<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.290> and

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
to enjoy themselves run and play and and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
to enjoy themselves run and play and and
I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> good<00:00:36.600> space<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.840> them<00:00:37.110> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.810 
I think it's a good space for them so
I'll<00:00:37.680> give<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> quick<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.129> tour<00:00:38.399> so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
added pans here we cut a cut a place for
those<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.740> quite<00:01:46.979> simply<00:01:47.340> pull<00:01:47.579> these

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
those and really quite simply pull these

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.969 
those and really quite simply pull these
out<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.229> I'll<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.380> leave<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
out and I'll just leave that up so you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
out and I'll just leave that up so you
can<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> better<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.509> there's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
can get a better look at it so there's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
can get a better look at it so there's
one<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.680> behind<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
one there and one right in behind it and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.959 
one there and one right in behind it and
that's<00:01:53.850> duplicated<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.659> both<00:01:54.810> sides<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's duplicated on both sides so that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
that's duplicated on both sides so that
that<00:01:56.969> should<00:01:57.360> work<00:01:57.540> out<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.750> fine<00:01:58.020> easy<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that should work out just fine easy to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.179 
that should work out just fine easy to
clean<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.020> push<00:02:01.259> those<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
clean and we just push those in and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
clean and we just push those in and
they're<00:02:02.909> there<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.960> doors<00:02:04.259> top<00:02:04.799> and

the<00:03:36.090> same<00:03:36.270> on<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.690> top<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.290> bottom<00:03:39.500> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the same on the top and the bottom so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.960 
the same on the top and the bottom so
that's<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.950> there<00:03:41.160> I'll<00:03:41.370> go<00:03:41.520> around<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that's it there I'll go around to the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.479 
that's it there I'll go around to the
other<00:03:42.060> side<00:03:42.590> got<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.650> couple<00:03:44.040> other<00:03:44.250> gizmos

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
other side got a couple other gizmos

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.590 
other side got a couple other gizmos
here<00:03:44.910> which<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.209> did<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.630> about<00:03:47.390> 18<00:03:48.390> inches

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
here which we did it's about 18 inches

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.820 
here which we did it's about 18 inches
off<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.780> ground<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.260> that's<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.560> too<00:03:49.709> bad

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
off the ground so that's not too bad

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.660 
off the ground so that's not too bad
we've<00:03:50.250> put<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.520> up<00:03:50.640> on<00:03:52.010> another<00:03:53.010> material<00:03:53.340> so

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
we've put it up on another material so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.360 
we've put it up on another material so
that<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.000> hover<00:03:54.570> cedar<00:03:54.900> posts<00:03:55.290> them<00:03:55.530> they

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that the hover cedar posts them they

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.420 
that the hover cedar posts them they
won't<00:03:56.550> rot<00:03:57.350> what<00:03:58.350> we've<00:03:58.470> done<00:03:58.650> here<00:03:59.010> I'll<00:03:59.190> just

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
won't rot what we've done here I'll just

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.250 
won't rot what we've done here I'll just
open<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.760> back<00:03:59.940> part<00:04:00.180> here<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.600> again

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
open this back part here and this again

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.680 
open this back part here and this again
is<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.650> mirror<00:04:02.520> image<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.910> what's<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.660> other

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
is a mirror image of what's on the other

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.199 
is a mirror image of what's on the other
side<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> that's<00:04:05.489> really<00:04:05.700> great

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
side so that's really great

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.790 
side so that's really great
and<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.690> rabbit<00:04:06.900> might<00:04:07.110> try<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.350> climb<00:04:07.560> up<00:04:07.680> there

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
and a rabbit might try to climb up there

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.170 
and a rabbit might try to climb up there
but<00:04:08.010> because<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.520> an<00:04:08.610> angle<00:04:08.880> he<00:04:09.030> has

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
but because that's on an angle he has

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
but because that's on an angle he has
absolutely<00:04:09.690> no<00:04:09.780> luck<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.739> that's<00:04:10.950> really

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
absolutely no luck so that's really

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.530 
absolutely no luck so that's really
great<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.050> we've<00:04:13.170> done<00:04:13.320> here<00:04:14.540> again

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
great and what we've done here again

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.020 
great and what we've done here again
there's<00:04:15.720> times<00:04:16.019> where<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.760> know<00:04:17.850> we<00:04:18.000> don't

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
there's times where you know we don't

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.750 
there's times where you know we don't
have<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.269> lot<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.510> rabbits<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.080> our<00:04:19.169> rabbitry

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
have a lot of rabbits in our rabbitry

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.300 
have a lot of rabbits in our rabbitry
certain<00:04:20.760> times<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:22.979> we've<00:04:23.100> done<00:04:23.250> is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
certain times and so what we've done is

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.090 
certain times and so what we've done is
created<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.760> little<00:04:23.970> wire<00:04:24.120> system<00:04:24.570> here<00:04:25.100> which

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
created a little wire system here which

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.379 
created a little wire system here which
is<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> latch<00:04:26.760> there

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
is on a latch there

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.029 
is on a latch there
and<00:04:27.569> you'll<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:27.960> writing<00:04:28.169> behind<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.680> just

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
and you'll see writing behind it just

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.550 
and you'll see writing behind it just
open<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.370> up<00:04:29.819> simply<00:04:30.719> pull<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.080> off<00:04:31.259> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
open that up simply pull that off and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.050 
open that up simply pull that off and
you'll<00:04:31.860> see<00:04:32.009> writing<00:04:32.189> behind<00:04:32.490> here<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.849> can

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
you'll see writing behind here I can

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.529 
you'll see writing behind here I can
raise<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.599> and<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:35.150> put<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.330> there

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
raise that up and just put it in there

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.350 
raise that up and just put it in there
and<00:04:36.689> that<00:04:36.780> remains<00:04:37.199> open<00:04:37.500> if<00:04:37.889> we<00:04:38.250> decide<00:04:38.639> that

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
and that remains open if we decide that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.140 
and that remains open if we decide that
we<00:04:39.629> want<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.139> allow<00:04:41.009> one<00:04:41.250> rabbit<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.639> have<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
we want to allow one rabbit to have the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.360 
we want to allow one rabbit to have the
entire<00:04:42.419> top<00:04:42.659> level<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:44.009> a<00:04:44.099> neat<00:04:44.250> little

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
entire top level it's just a neat little

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.339 
entire top level it's just a neat little
feature<00:04:44.669> it's<00:04:44.909> completely<00:04:45.419> unnecessary<00:04:45.629> it

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
feature it's completely unnecessary it

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.869 
feature it's completely unnecessary it
was<00:04:46.530> kind<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.770> fun<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.069> design<00:04:47.189> a<00:04:47.370> build<00:04:47.669> and

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
was kind of fun to design a build and

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.290 
was kind of fun to design a build and
it's<00:04:48.000> fun<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.719> show<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:48.990> off<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.139> little<00:04:49.289> bit<00:04:49.439> so

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
it's fun to show it off a little bit so

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.240 
it's fun to show it off a little bit so
that<00:04:51.300> works<00:04:51.539> out<00:04:51.689> really<00:04:51.900> well<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.469> a<00:04:52.949> simple

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
that works out really well just a simple

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.830 
that works out really well just a simple
little<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.699> is<00:04:53.819> clothesline<00:04:54.270> wire<00:04:54.509> which<00:04:54.750> I

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
little this is clothesline wire which I

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.240 
little this is clothesline wire which I
had<00:04:55.430> just<00:04:56.430> what<00:04:56.699> kicking<00:04:57.000> around<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:58.250> there

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
had just what kicking around and there

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.769 
had just what kicking around and there
it<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.460> closed<00:04:59.759> so<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.150> works<00:05:00.449> out<00:05:00.569> really

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
it is closed so that works out really

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:06.140 
it is closed so that works out really
well<00:05:00.960> as<00:05:01.199> well<00:05:02.539> this<00:05:03.539> guy<00:05:03.840> here<00:05:04.169> took<00:05:04.439> us<00:05:05.150> took
