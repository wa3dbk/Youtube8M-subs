00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.509
 hi everyone thanks for stopping by me 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.240
 at the light today I will have a story 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.349
 Pro u knitted toy and lavender 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 mishan what water herself called this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.150
 the bear was tied by request 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.400
 and my clients and to be honest, I used to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.050
 in general, it never occurred to me 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.320
 see lavender bears but so me 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 I liked that image that I liked 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 client stones described what I decided 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.410
 take up this business and is now ready for you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.840
 tell a little about it and so 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 lavender bear was tied with cotton 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.699
 ip on the main color 58a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 the muzzle of the heels of the pen is such as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 would be white almost this 230 color also 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.189
 sweater was tied 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.150
 again it was my shrimp's idea 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.159
 wonderful little Lena and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 sweater I knitted gray adelia yarn 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.549
 or acrylic and she came out sweaters lavan 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.619
 daughter 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.369
 Hacker thread I embroidered 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 plant soluble kanzi i like this 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.820
 I got it all from the white bears 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.540
 pens and legs on the oil mount they 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.540
 move 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.450
 nose and eyes in plastic bears 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.650
 I bought them bought Leonardo 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.240
 at the same time the nose was called the nose of an animal 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.520
 made in Japan in my eyes 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.369
 just thats plastic black eyes a 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 worth bear is not very good because u 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.630
 him heels tidy no 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.479
 I did not add granulate down 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.200
 just because that way i 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.520
 I see 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 hind legs he well how would it be uncomfortable 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.130
 In general, I want to revise this method to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.530
 the word I used the description 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.090
 knitted teddy bears from anna makarova I tell you 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.830
 I'll drop the link under the video 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.580
 if anyone is interested but I do not care 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:29.019
 remade this scheme for themselves but what 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 touches the rear legs, then I do them as 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.780
 says with the head invented but not 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.060
 less there are some moments that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.220
 I'm not happy or maybe if I 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.760
 I will and I will continue to listen to like a fly 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.840
 remodel and cute bears itself 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.620
 saying and i also 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.079
 put a little bonus this ethereal 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.640
 lavender oil as my client 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.519
 said she wanted to use this 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.739
 bear for flavoring 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.310
 so he calmed down for the night and how we all 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:10.220
 know lavender oil lavender scent has 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.590
 such a property put to sleep a little 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.810
 and accordingly decided to invest such 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.640
 little present shell pouch nourished 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 for this and 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 in general, this is a box of butter 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.930
 the top is wonderful in this 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.750
 small bag and quietly fastened 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:35.120
 and also besides that I decided all the same 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.610
 make a package for mischa not like that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.120
 the handbag that I sewed and my beloved 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:47.440
 lavender-colored swag and cotton 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 which I used for decoration and for 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.170
 inner lining 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.480
 I, as I said earlier, really loved 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.010
 ports q I think that a lot of it can be 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.490
 what does she do the subway to she is dense and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.970
 she looks like that 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.680
 natural pretty therefore 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.830
 I liked this business of course it did not cost 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.620
 without my 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.560
 logo etiketochki where do without it well, 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.239
 series 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 label paper which tells what 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.190
 what kind of teddy bear is this handmade work and who 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.650
 this is Nagara soup and faith 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.950
 she took the bear as a whole 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.300
 here 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.960
 from the purely work day probably 3 but you need 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.460
 understand that I was not knitting at the ready 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.130
 scheme and something else invented out of my head 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.710
 Incidentally, the light of the rock, too, therefore 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.640
 of course it took some imagination 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.830
 time and blowing is always of course 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.169
 some kind of risk because 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.169
 hand on heart i'm not 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.660
 some kind of super-duper by experienced liza box 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.150
 who can do super duper 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.190
 some schemes like this 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.100
 and tied up 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.590
 there were moments when it was necessary to dissolve 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.640
 what is there to tie something to think about it 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.460
 redo the whole result i 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.410
 I was pleased I hope that you 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.620

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.650

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.650
 so that you too tied your kiddies 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.800

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.230
