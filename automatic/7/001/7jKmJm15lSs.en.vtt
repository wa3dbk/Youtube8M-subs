a final chapter in my inception trilogy
which<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.509> regret<00:01:42.899> naming<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which I actually regret naming this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
which I actually regret naming this
inception<00:01:44.430> three<00:01:44.610> point<00:01:44.939> 0<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> couple

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
inception three point 0 because a couple

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.010 
inception three point 0 because a couple
months<00:01:46.290> later<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.890> release<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:48.090> final<00:01:48.720> black

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
months later I release my final black

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
months later I release my final black
ops<00:01:49.259> 1<00:01:49.350> montage<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.909> good<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
ops 1 montage that was pretty good and I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
ops 1 montage that was pretty good and I
think<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> probably<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.829> best<00:01:53.009> black<00:01:53.310> ops<00:01:53.490> 1

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
think it's probably my best black ops 1

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.399 
think it's probably my best black ops 1
montage<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.329> I'll<00:01:54.509> make<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> look<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.380> on

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.580 
montage which I'll make a look back on
you<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.520> another<00:01:56.909> day<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> could<00:01:58.500> have

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you know on another day but I could have

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
you know on another day but I could have
called<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.890> inception<00:01:59.430> three-point<00:02:00.000> oh<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
called that inception three-point oh and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.580 
called that inception three-point oh and
it<00:02:00.270> would<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.479> made<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> lot<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.810> sense<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it would have made a lot more sense and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
it would have made a lot more sense and
you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.610> finished<00:02:02.729> off<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you know I would have finished off like

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
you know I would have finished off like
the<00:02:03.509> trilogy<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.259> perfect<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.250> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the trilogy in a perfect way because it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
the trilogy in a perfect way because it
was<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> really<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:05.969> black<00:02:06.240> ops<00:02:06.450> 1<00:02:06.540> montage

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
was a really good black ops 1 montage

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800 
was a really good black ops 1 montage
and<00:02:07.469> I've<00:02:08.129> always<00:02:08.340> wanted<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.270> continue

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810

and I've always wanted like to continue
the<00:02:10.110> series<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.750> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
probably you know maybe do inception

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.559 
probably you know maybe do inception
four-point-oh<00:02:18.340> or<00:02:18.879> something<00:02:19.389> like<00:02:19.510> that

finish the series off in a really good
way<00:02:23.139> in<00:02:23.530> my<00:02:23.650> opinion<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:24.099> one<00:02:24.310> was<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.489> real

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
way in my opinion this one was a real

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.319 
way in my opinion this one was a real
letdown<00:02:25.659> like<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:26.709> even<00:02:26.859> remember<00:02:27.329> you
