00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 I found this top with a quick video 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 for you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 to say I will try to be fast which is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 always a bit difficult, right? 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 well then is today's video is a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.579
 tutorial a guide is actually giving 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 tips for you than in my opinion 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.950
 What are the key brushes for 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 you are starting're so if you are 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.780
 makeup artist or if you are not a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.550
 You just like to automate yourself. 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.079
 any brushes you should have 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 It's up to you not to invest in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.750
 a lot of wrong brush actually 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 brush for me is never too much, right? 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 but there are those brushes that are going to be 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 for you when you are 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 starting for you want to automate 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.390
 Or for you who is a makeup artist to change 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.010
 my opinion is essential without much 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 thing if you have to spend a lot and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.170
 you have to buy a lot of kind of 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.659
 brush is the basics of the basics in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 My opinion the girl is there to check 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.110
 which is in my opinion essential for 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.759
 Tiny skin today I go with the first 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.540
 split splitting which your hair 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.630
 for you are part 1 is face and part 2 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.210
 It's going to be the first one I think is super. 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.790
 important you have is a powder brush 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 okay I'll try to be brief okay boy 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.829
 Are the 6th basics with it you can? 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.189
 use it for functions you can 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.720
 use it to make outlines advice 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.380
 to our blush 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 you can use it as the function is that it is 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 even from the late afternoon powder you can 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
 use it to give more formed by a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.439
 brand to improve this is logical as well 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.390
 He is super big and has several 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.850
 sizes brushes for rice also powder 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.619
 but is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.330
 You do not want to use copy what I 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.250
 I mean the following with a brush of 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.550
 if you can give several functions 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.619
 It stands to reason that if you applied like blush 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.569
 outlines and you may not be using as 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.640
 occurs then because otherwise you will be 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.010
 with the face stained in people because the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.440
 powder tint and blushes are 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 different okay I think it's very 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.170
 important you have a full-blown brush 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 well I love this one here is the majority that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.130
 I'll show up and all 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.020
 sigma brushes you will find in the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.269
 shop side blog to follow now is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.030
 partner here blog is so you go 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.130

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.600
 there okay're good then this one is f 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.510
 30 on sic for me it's more more more 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.940
 important aspect of face skin is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.100
 collective of curitiba no excuse is the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.400
 Base is for me, it's super important. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.030
 people because the base I have it from here 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.370
 that it is so with round tube that 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.610
 It's my favorite that he's from Sigma. 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.739
 also has another told correct and has the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.959
 that linguist like 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.079
 I was talking to you, little girl. 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.450
 this're here is that the traditional 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.940
 base I do not particularly like 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.400
 apply the base with it because it is 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.160
 very small and until you apply base in 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.250
 all your face people he can leave 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.070
 a little marked does not like me always 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.859
 I used my interest before meeting 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.370
 the others like this but after I met 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:38.400
 he was already celebrating the corrective is the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.609
 rarely use for base of mas 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.680
 if you are there, you can start with 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.380
 he then a tip that I let you have 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.200
 he likes to wear more pony then to 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.720
 to standardize is the one that is also sigma 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 only it has a diagonal top as 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 you can and still speak intention of 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.850
 base is have these fire poodle detection 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.359
 know are another going there to people who 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.610
 will see in the eyes are they well 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.620
 little girls too big dreams and tone 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.900
 you can apply the base also with the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.450
 recapturing basic brushes is 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.620
 extremely important of the tetéu michel 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.450
 under our kind I was elected because 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.160
 the demanding is important to always be 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.700
 base is where I left four 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.360
 suggestions for you are uó of 4 model 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.330
 blush brush I think a brush of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.860
 blush and the contour brush is very 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.110
 important you so good so let's go 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.570
 talk a little bit about the last two 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.850
 Bid is this traditional and tried pin 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.060
 racy diagonally so all the dirty 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.550
 girl do not fix then it's the field o 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.200
 problem today and you can use it to 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.950
 contour can not be the same either. 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.330
 function for a brush only this here is the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.550
 The smallest rectangle is smaller than it is 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.930
 f10 5 da silva I use to contour 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.410
 because it is smaller 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.410
 is then high to make the regions 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.810
 better but you can do with that should 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.200
 to do the same function passes an outline and 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.810
 then taste but I would indicate if you 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.770
 likes that you have both options 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.169
 can be 2 of that pot can be two 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.850
 highlight one for blush for outline ta 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.560
 is that it is smaller than it is a 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.020
 a little more specific but may have 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.130
 two brushes also in the 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.080
 then continuing to another that I think 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.020
 It's very important that you have the game. 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.150
 of rosso is a smaller brush is in the 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.970
 if you have two options here 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.160
 for you to see that it is a more pointed and 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.300
 one with the top on the diagonal 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:49.380
 So it's okay, this is the point. 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.960
 is the peu 86 sigma and that the account here 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.930
 mouse actually bevelled it 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.180
 machine and has no reference're so 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.760
 so I think the smaller brush it is 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.400
 important because why are you going to do it? 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.950
 smaller regions I do not use them to 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.560
 to apply corrective there are people who like 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.889
 is raw gate to apply corrective 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.840
 that you use and 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.370
 to apply collective or brush as well 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.039
 which would be basic 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.199
 I use so to apply it or 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.419
 usually most often opens with 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.310
 finger of the beats I can make one 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.979
 step-by-step you want 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.499
 so you already have one how to apply 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.840
 correction in the channel may leave the 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.960
 link down to you 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.520
 So I 'll keep my finger and then what I 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.069
 I do minor things, I come here. 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.710
 I present well under my makeup and 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.509
 I come as my finger does not slope 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.669
 I can take it and so close. 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.819
 we are the brush for these regions 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.789
 to make a mouth outline to make the 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.800
 nose contour so it will light up 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.840
 in the center of the face gave so I use to 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.419
 very small regions I think it's okay 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.509
 cool you have one of these regions to 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.819
 your brother - then the 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.159
 brushes I think are fundamental 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.719
 this status we will recapitulate asking 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:09.039
 pension out 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:12.400
 a pension to base a brush for blush 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:14.469
 one that only outlines and a brush 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.539
 lower by smaller regions 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.819
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.770
 was the part a balance the part 2 to 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.680
