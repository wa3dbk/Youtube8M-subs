00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.559
 dark colored gardeners those of skin 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.110

 the Arabs had real fear of the 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.970
 lack of water and they thought there were three

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.640
 the sierra de gredos and see a landscape 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.610
 noble silent and melancholic 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.530
