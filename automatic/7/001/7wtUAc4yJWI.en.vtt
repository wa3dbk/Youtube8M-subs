 channel today we will make such 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.629
 review on the color from the company garnier 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 garnier olia 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.940
 this is ammonia-free paints this is one of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
 the biggest upstairs of recent times 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.410
 I want to say first that it is 2 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 packaging last time I had another 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.670
 color if what I have just somewhere to put 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 photo and so on besides i'm not only 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 show you what's here but show 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.300
 to you the result of dyeing ie hair yes 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 and hair after dyeing so you understand 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 how it works and the first thing I want 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.110
 say and perhaps this is a common thing that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 it is average in cost i mean they 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 super cheap and and enough but personally on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.300
 my hair is a little below the chest 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 painting one purchase to me completely for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.219
 this is enough to expire while she 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 keeps great condition on you and this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.579
 about two months 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 those are your hair honestly rhinestone 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.440
 paint box natural color and theft i 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.410
 im literally once every two or three months 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.120
 no more of this effect is enough for me just 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.629
 root hair cantor begin 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.780
 grow 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 and when they grow back more than two 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 three four centimeters of course this 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.260
 noticeably and also immediately respond to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.290
 the question is why do I dye my hair 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.110
 I have a little natural hair 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.110
 damp dull and that is they do not have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.509
 such a bright saturated pigment due to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 this on ben and dye my hair if 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.939
 would they hurt me kim here 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.640
 greyish 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.259
 since I already have them, I also have them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 tints because I don't like 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.049
 vodka here is a dull incomprehensible shade 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.159
 my hair 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.329
 Further what I have called for 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.280
 415 is a cold chocolate shade in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.590
 principle color type candy has been 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 neutral so they suit me different 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.920
 shades and different shades i tried if 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.350
 also answer the question what colors I 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.700
 I can advise by experience 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.219
 only 2 is lara 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 Rome eye is also non-ammonia and this 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.409
 careers and I here these 2 class I in 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.600
 the first does not dry out the hair they are not 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.479
 cause hair loss and they 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 non- ammonia therefore the structure of the hair is not 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.319
 so badly spoiled 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.819
 This is personally my opinion of course if you 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 you know good to yourself write me 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.810
 please bear i will thank you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.790
 now let's consider what is here 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.540
 is of course there is a standard 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.040
 instruction 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 I wo n't even be shown 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.640
 what to do with the Cossack and so on 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 there is now technics tatyane 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.080
 black and honest to me she should 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.480
 like here hair balm 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.900
 pretty standard literal set 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.610
 look like Henri 1 liked 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.940
 and of course and oxidative how 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.500
 use if by test they are in their 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.030
 use properties a little 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.610
 like even more option why 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.040
 because blah I expire letters of the steps 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.599
 susey here you unscrew it and this one 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.569
 tube of paint according to the sense there 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.640
 Normally, you can insert and already such 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.739
 banks and and shake well here 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.670
 need some kind of capacity not 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.620
 metal 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.989
 so that you can mix well 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.530
 paint on and mucous in this way 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.810
 contriving his goal for screaming straight 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.430
 here is this oxidizer I honestly so 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.290
 more convenient because so much easier 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.109
 distribute the helmet and put it on 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.680
 hair by smell is rather nice not 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.450
 sugary washed off very well 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.760
 real hair color probably already 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.709
 appears after three or four days 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.650
 more precisely after the second flush paint 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.230
 I want to say that she's doing great 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.049
 after her hair do not fall out no 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.459
 skin irritations 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.540
 nisyros someone bother over 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.849
 to paint 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.090
 solely on the hair do not touch there is not 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.069
 God forbid something like that but with all 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.680
 this she tries well cope 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.090
 easy balsam here is just fine and here 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.430
 if you bought such paints 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.230
 never use these here 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.389
 boy do not throw away was not 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.270
 form and because they are very 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.980
 are good and they are very 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.960
 the river is further used 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.610
 such balms are really very good 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.660
 restore hair and makes them 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.910
 obedient 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.160
 to completely stand-up stop 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.200
 hair after dyeing you just need 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.450
 such a landing try to surprise him on 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.700
 3 uses is the most ideal 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.640
 option speak just by my own experience 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.709
 I somehow like everyone 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.720
 I will show the result to me that this paint 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.820
 I like it very much and I think that I will 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.980
 I will use it in the following photo 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 I hope I will from this than say 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.720
 because I will be very grateful if you 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.200

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.270
 for hair

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.640
