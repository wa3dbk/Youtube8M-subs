00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.540 

I've<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:43.770> pair<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.570> turnigy<00:00:45.570> nanotech<00:00:46.550> lipo

packs<00:00:47.850> coming<00:00:48.180> through<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> post<00:00:48.660> from

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
packs coming through the post from

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
packs coming through the post from
America<00:00:50.180> they're<00:00:51.180> 65<00:00:52.020> seed<00:00:52.530> discharged<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
America they're 65 seed discharged and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.000 
America they're 65 seed discharged and
130<00:00:54.060> C<00:00:54.300> burst<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.170> should<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> go

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
130 C burst so they should make this go

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.230 
130 C burst so they should make this go
quite<00:00:56.310> well<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.320> 980<00:01:02.010> kV<00:01:02.610> motor<00:01:05.210> what<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
quite well it's a 980 kV motor what a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
quite well it's a 980 kV motor what a
lot<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> people<00:01:06.660> do<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:06.930> confuse<00:01:07.440> kV<00:01:07.950> with

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
lot of people do is they confuse kV with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
lot of people do is they confuse kV with
kilovolt<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> kV<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.410> means<00:01:11.810> revs

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
kilovolt but the kV actually means revs

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
kilovolt but the kV actually means revs
per<00:01:13.320> volt<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.440> put<00:01:16.619> 1<00:01:16.860> volt<00:01:17.190> through

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
per volt so if you put 1 volt through

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.410 
per volt so if you put 1 volt through
the<00:01:17.580> motor<00:01:17.790> you'll<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.200> 980<00:01:19.200> revs<00:01:20.240> I'm<00:01:21.240> going

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the motor you'll get 980 revs I'm going

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.930 
the motor you'll get 980 revs I'm going
to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.540> running<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.850> 22<00:01:23.850> point<00:01:24.119> 2<00:01:24.360> volts

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
to be running this on 22 point 2 volts

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.550 
to be running this on 22 point 2 volts
so<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:26.970> should<00:01:27.300> get<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.600> 21<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.410> half

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so I should get about 21 and a half

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
so I should get about 21 and a half
thousand<00:01:29.160> rpm<00:01:32.660> well<00:01:33.660> people<00:01:33.840> say<00:01:34.140> 980<00:01:35.070> kV<00:01:35.670> bit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
thousand rpm well people say 980 kV bit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.180 
thousand rpm well people say 980 kV bit
of<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> small<00:01:37.080> motor<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.649> one-fifth<00:01:38.039> scale

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
of a small motor for a one-fifth scale

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.180 
of a small motor for a one-fifth scale
buggy<00:01:38.940> but<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.660> not<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> case<00:01:40.190> because

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
buggy but that's not the case because

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.060 
buggy but that's not the case because
the<00:01:41.460> lower<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> kV<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> higher<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.590> talk<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the lower the kV the higher the talk the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600 
the lower the kV the higher the talk the
higher<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.429> kV<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.840> lower<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.259> talk<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
higher the kV the lower the talk but the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.010 
higher the kV the lower the talk but the
higher<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.970> revs

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.359 

I<00:01:55.430> think<00:01:56.430> when<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> about<00:01:58.369> 47,000

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
I think when you get up to about 47,000

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.429 
I think when you get up to about 47,000
kV<00:01:59.850> oh<00:02:00.090> sorry<00:02:00.619> 4200<00:02:01.619> kV<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.899> can't<00:02:04.140> put<00:02:04.320> so

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
kV oh sorry 4200 kV you can't put so

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.039 
kV oh sorry 4200 kV you can't put so
many<00:02:04.530> volts<00:02:04.799> through<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.899> get

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
many volts through it so you don't get

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.990 
many volts through it so you don't get
as<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.259> talk<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
as much talk but you do get a lot of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.600 
as much talk but you do get a lot of
revs<00:02:11.840> that's<00:02:12.840> why<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.340> smaller

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
revs that's why I think the smaller

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.850 
revs that's why I think the smaller
babies<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:15.450> 9,000<00:02:16.170> kV<00:02:16.500> motors<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
babies have like 9,000 kV motors in you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.660 
babies have like 9,000 kV motors in you
can<00:02:20.040> about<00:02:20.660> 11<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:22.080> 14<00:02:22.319> volts<00:02:22.530> through<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.190> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
can about 11 to 14 volts through it you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.949 
can about 11 to 14 volts through it you
get<00:02:23.819> plenty<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.150> revs<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.340> much<00:02:26.459> power

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.360 

on<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> lower<00:02:31.319> kV<00:02:32.069> motors<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.530> wire<00:02:34.799> that's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
on the lower kV motors the wire that's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.090 
on the lower kV motors the wire that's
wound<00:02:35.760> inside<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.360> much<00:02:36.540> thicker<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.230> that's

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
wound inside is much thicker and that's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
wound inside is much thicker and that's
why<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.049> put<00:02:40.319> by<00:02:40.950> 22<00:02:41.489> or<00:02:41.850> 25<00:02:42.450> volts

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
why you can put by 22 or 25 volts

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000 
why you can put by 22 or 25 volts
through<00:02:44.209> whereas<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.360> higher<00:02:45.540> kV<00:02:45.989> motors<00:02:46.380> as

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
through whereas the higher kV motors as

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.479 
through whereas the higher kV motors as
a<00:02:47.130> much<00:02:47.430> thinner<00:02:47.700> wire<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:49.799> allows<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.220> ref

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
a much thinner wire it allows it to ref

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.900 
a much thinner wire it allows it to ref
higher<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.170> can't<00:02:52.530> put<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.370> many<00:02:53.519> volts

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
higher but you can't put so many volts

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.130 
higher but you can't put so many volts
through<00:02:56.450> right<00:02:57.450> I'm<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.840> wait<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
through right I'm just going to wait to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.530 
through right I'm just going to wait to
get<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> packs<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> post<00:02:59.420> then<00:03:00.420> I'm

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
get the packs through the post then I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.810 
get the packs through the post then I'm
gonna<00:03:00.660> plug<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:02.310> I'll<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.640> another

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
gonna plug it in and I'll do another

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.819 
gonna plug it in and I'll do another
video<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.340> see<00:03:05.519> how<00:03:05.579> it<00:03:05.700> goes

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
video so you can see how it goes

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.040 
video so you can see how it goes
thanks<00:03:07.829> for<00:03:07.950> watching
