00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 the program is mostly one only 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 challenging shots that you now see on 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.939
 screen through the head throws with 3 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.939

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 now maxim finishes his program 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.780
 I think he will get enough 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 high rating 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.840
 your grandfather smiled so well it was 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.119
 drop weights but I think with his 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.940
 complexity and high odds he doesn't 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.000
 take a high place now we are yours

 Russia he was the champion of Russia five more 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.260
 years ago and since then he successfully successfully 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.290
 act on rda of all russian forums 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 This athlete is distinguished by a high 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.459
 amplitude of movement unfortunately falls 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.000
 fall is a gross error in our form 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.760

 0.8 bar is removed for a drop 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.330
 as I said this athlete in 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.390
 it differs from the others very much 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.350
 high flying weights wide sweeping 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.220
 movement that looks great 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.020
 visually judging by the applause of the audience 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.720
 the work of this athlete is also very 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.830
 like and tell too much 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.040
 difficult program 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.160
 his arsenal of 37 elements of the highest group 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 difficulties 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.630
 it seems to me less accurate on works 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.610
 than maxims probably a phenomenon to me before 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.530
 Competitions told that he was long 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.530
 time not trained due to the transition 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.360
 on another job and began preparing for 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 this competition somewhere weeks for 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.959
 money and exercise technique 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.080
 requires to exercise with weights 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.720
 problems we show evgeny even 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.650
 worked in the circus yes evgeny some 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.930
 time worked in the Lipetsk regional circus 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.970
 here and we already thought with our guys 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.420
 that never beat him because 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.250
 performed in the same program that 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.709
 she shows now but only 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.380
 staged by the director with complicated 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.910
 more beautiful elements he spoke 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.650
 with his circus program on 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.570
 World Championships in Babaevo 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.590
 here and there he produced on the old 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.870
 real furor 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.280
 but life is life and now he is a circus 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.180
 no longer works on your screens 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.880
 vadim anurov master of sports from moscow 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.720
 this athlete also performs very 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.900
 long and successful it is also like the stories 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.840
 1 5 was the champion of Russia winner 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.319
 Russian Cup 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.320
 [applause] 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.930
 the program at vadim is also enough 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.509
 complex saturated 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.389
 he has thirty-two elements 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.220
 higher difficulty groups he also 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.340
 challenger for one of the highest 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.380
 places 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.880
 born to a higher group what 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.120
 mean by highest group bad 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.289
 throws throws higher difficulty group 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.370
 it's throws with three turns in front of you 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:49.960
 with 3 turns in the lateral plane with 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.870
 3 turns when throwing weights through 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.449
 head I conditionally say it all 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.050
 because throws a lot of order 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.599
 100 orders of hundreds of shots with just one 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.130
 turnover of weights, I'm not talking about two 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.599
 rpm and 3 rpm weights 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.160
 athletes from building their program 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.590
 self is arbitrary 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.349
 the program they pick up those throws 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.460
 who in their opinion are most beneficial their 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.639
 distinguished by complexity group 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.289
 chooses tanks himself throws for the program 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.479
 on your screens, too, is not the course Michael from 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.639
 St. Petersburg 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.830
 I am an athlete and master of sports 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.490
 master of sports he performed on the past 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:37.360
 Russian Cup in Rybinsk and became 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.270
 immediately old and became immediately second this 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.789
 very talented athlete distinguish him 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.940
 also a very large number of complex 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.639
 throws and besides in his arsenal there is 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.300
 several bundles are also complex 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.630
 items 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.570
 consisting of several difficult on 5 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.289
 challenging shots that go in a row here 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.789
 now you see this bunch 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.849
 day of thousands and how often in your program 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.219
 apply throws in 4 turns 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.229
 all athletes whom you see 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.539
 now on your screen is the strongest 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.940
 sportsmen in russia in their arsenal 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.080
 each practically has throws in 4 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.880
 points turnovers it is super difficult or 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.870
 Well, one by two such throws 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.340
 Each of these guys have it 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.910
 big risk to make such a throw 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.370
 but the risk is big enough but these throws 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.140
 and valued more by this member 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.400
 each participant to choose 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.270
 to risk or not to say that 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.550
 St. Petersburg School of Power 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.970
 juggling kettlebells are great 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.680
 progresses guys grow right on 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.200
 eyes on these competitions 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.150
 three athletes one guy and two girls 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.150
 the standards of masters of sports are fulfilled
