but when I have it in the house I add it
because<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.019> will<00:02:38.079> give<00:02:38.290> more<00:02:38.470> sauce<00:02:38.890> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360

because that's the only herb that's in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.800 
because that's the only herb that's in
here<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:22.630> really<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.290> a<00:05:23.320> nice<00:05:23.770> touch<00:05:24.810> okay

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810

and<00:05:26.970> like<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.180> said<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.810> chicken<00:05:29.200> broth<00:05:29.410> I

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
and like I said I have chicken broth I

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.270 
and like I said I have chicken broth I
usually<00:05:31.240> don't<00:05:31.450> put<00:05:31.630> chicken<00:05:32.169> broth<00:05:32.350> but

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
usually don't put chicken broth but

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.320 
usually don't put chicken broth but
since<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:33.729> have<00:05:34.030> it<00:05:34.060> it's<00:05:34.479> going<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.810> add<00:05:35.020> more
