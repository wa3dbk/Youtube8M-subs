had<00:00:25.920> thought<00:00:26.660> here's<00:00:27.660> why<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> reason<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
had thought here's why the reason that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.759 
had thought here's why the reason that
um<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.660> clips<00:00:30.960> weren't<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> best<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.650> know

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
um the clips weren't the best you know

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
um the clips weren't the best you know
at<00:00:31.859> least<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:32.219> thought<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> clips<00:00:32.910> weren't<00:00:33.270> my

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
at least i thought the clips weren't my

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
at least i thought the clips weren't my
best<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> could<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.170> gotten<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.649> because

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
best that I could have gotten is because

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
best that I could have gotten is because
first<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.390> supposed<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
first of all this was supposed to be a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
first of all this was supposed to be a
30k<00:00:37.469> montage<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.309> actual<00:00:38.640> montage<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

wasn't<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
wasn't going to go down as well as it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.279 
wasn't going to go down as well as it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
did because of the some of the clips

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.640 
did because of the some of the clips
weren't<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.760> opinion<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
weren't that good in my opinion but you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
was a huge relief and I'm another reason

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
was a huge relief and I'm another reason
is<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.439> tired<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.799> grinding

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is because I was just tired of grinding
