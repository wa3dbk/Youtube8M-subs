there's nothing I can do about it
however<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.709> hoping<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.430> I'd<00:03:47.549> be<00:03:47.640> able<00:03:47.760> to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
however I was hoping that I'd be able to

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.960 
however I was hoping that I'd be able to
set<00:03:48.030> some<00:03:48.180> ground<00:03:48.299> rules<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.900> guys<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
set some ground rules with you guys and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.380 
set some ground rules with you guys and
you<00:03:50.970> know<00:03:51.090> maybe<00:03:52.130> maybe<00:03:53.130> make<00:03:54.090> things<00:03:54.299> a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
you know maybe maybe make things a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.650 
you know maybe maybe make things a
little<00:03:54.510> bit<00:03:54.690> easier<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.650> deal<00:03:56.310> with<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.940> what<00:03:57.630> I

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
little bit easier to deal with so what I

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.509 
little bit easier to deal with so what I
propose<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.470> if<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.370> me<00:03:59.489> playing

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
propose is that if you see me playing

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.210 
propose is that if you see me playing
deathmatch<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:00.690> not<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:00.989> I'm<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
deathmatch and it's not like I'm in the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.620 
deathmatch and it's not like I'm in the
evening<00:04:02.730> or<00:04:02.820> at<00:04:02.940> night<00:04:02.970> or<00:04:03.239> something<00:04:03.420> like

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
evening or at night or something like

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.660 
evening or at night or something like
that<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.019> probably<00:04:04.530> am<00:04:04.859> just<00:04:05.040> fraggin<00:04:05.370> people

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that I probably am just fraggin people
