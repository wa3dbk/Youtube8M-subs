00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
series but you know some things I talk

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.549 
series but you know some things I talk
about<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> later<00:00:51.780> books<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.440> might

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
about in the later books that might

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
about in the later books that might
spoil<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:53.760> things<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> first

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
first one for my favorite but it's a big

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.440 
first one for my favorite but it's a big
book<00:04:49.660> it's<00:04:49.930> over<00:04:50.620> 600<00:04:51.100> pages<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:52.000> lot<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.330> it

book it's over 600 pages and a lot of it

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.420 
book it's over 600 pages and a lot of it
especially<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.960> beginning<00:04:53.050> it's<00:04:53.470> action<00:04:53.920> so

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
especially the beginning it's action so

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.850 
especially the beginning it's action so
if<00:04:54.700> you<00:04:54.730> don't<00:04:55.210> like<00:04:55.600> action<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.530> would<00:04:56.710> not

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
if you don't like action I would not

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.320 
if you don't like action I would not
recommend<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.310> series<00:04:57.730> because<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.210> does

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
recommend this series because it does

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.420 
recommend this series because it does
have<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.540> lot<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.720> action<00:04:58.960> but<00:04:59.770> I<00:05:00.040> think<00:05:00.310> it's

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
have a lot of action but I think it's

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.890 
have a lot of action but I think it's
really<00:05:00.640> interesting<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.420> its<00:05:01.510> really<00:05:01.630> worth

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
really interesting and its really worth

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.750 
really interesting and its really worth
it<00:05:02.110> because<00:05:02.230> although<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:02.950> action<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.490> lot<00:05:03.610> of

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
it because although it's action a lot of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.400 
it because although it's action a lot of
things<00:05:03.940> are<00:05:04.060> happening<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.690> there<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:05.200> move

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
things are happening in there that move

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.010 
things are happening in there that move
the<00:05:05.620> story<00:05:05.860> along

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
the story along

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.960 
the story along
characters<00:05:08.020> are<00:05:08.200> being<00:05:08.350> developed<00:05:08.730> like<00:05:09.730> that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
characters are being developed like that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.520 
characters are being developed like that
is<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.330> think<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.720> number<00:05:11.050> one<00:05:11.080> thing<00:05:11.380> about

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
is I think the number one thing about

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.020 
is I think the number one thing about
this<00:05:11.680> series<00:05:12.040> is<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.370> development<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:12.940> the
