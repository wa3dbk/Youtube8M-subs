1.2 i wanted to show off a new item you
and<00:00:12.920> that<00:00:13.920> wasn't<00:00:14.219> supposed<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> happen<00:00:14.549> but

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and that wasn't supposed to happen but

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.260 
and that wasn't supposed to happen but
it<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> good<00:00:15.330> example<00:00:17.029> it's<00:00:18.029> called

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it was a good example it's called

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240 
it was a good example it's called
dispenser<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.560> arrows<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
dispenser and if you put arrows in it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.599 
dispenser and if you put arrows in it
and<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> connect<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.600> redstone<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.609> such

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and if you connect a redstone to it such

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.380 
and if you connect a redstone to it such
as<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.029> did<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:25.550> you'll<00:00:26.550> make<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> shoot<00:00:27.060> stuff

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
as I did here you'll make it shoot stuff

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
as I did here you'll make it shoot stuff
so<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.710> normal<00:00:29.099> items<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
so you can also be normal items in it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.220 
so you can also be normal items in it
which<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.359> haven't<00:00:30.599> tried<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.170> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
here I'll show you what I did I made a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780 
here I'll show you what I did I made a
simple<00:01:15.330> blinker<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> connected<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
simple blinker and then I connected a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.560 
simple blinker and then I connected a
negative<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> blinker<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.390> that's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
negative to the blinker so that's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109 
negative to the blinker so that's
disabled<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> entire<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.920> oh<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.909> bad<00:01:24.090> i

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
disabled the entire time oh my bad i

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
disabled the entire time oh my bad i
connect<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> positive<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
connect that positive and then when I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.550 
connect that positive and then when I
turn<00:01:26.729> off<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> positive<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> blinkers

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
turn off the positive then the blinkers

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
turn off the positive then the blinkers
turned<00:01:28.829> off<00:01:29.040> normal<00:01:29.840> just<00:01:30.840> put<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.140> little

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
turned off normal just put that little

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.830 
turned off normal just put that little
stone<00:01:31.710> pad<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> can't<00:01:33.329> evade<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
stone pad on that so I can't evade it on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
stone pad on that so I can't evade it on
and<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.520> gun<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:38.210> as

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and off like pretty much a gun and as

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
and off like pretty much a gun and as
you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.479> can't<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.369> connect<00:01:41.369> redstone

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you know can't really connect redstone

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
you know can't really connect redstone
right<00:01:42.299> next<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> each<00:01:42.750> other<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> had<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> run

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
right next to each other so I had to run

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.139 
right next to each other so I had to run
it<00:01:43.860> under<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.360> redstone<00:01:45.930> torch<00:01:47.149> with

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it under with a redstone torch with

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.230 
it under with a redstone torch with
every<00:01:48.420> single<00:01:48.720> other<00:01:48.810> dispenser<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.240> then

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
every single other dispenser and then

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.760 
every single other dispenser and then
normal<00:01:51.600> redstone<00:01:52.079> connection<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
normal redstone connection like so and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.649
