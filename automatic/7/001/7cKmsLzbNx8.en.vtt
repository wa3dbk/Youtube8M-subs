00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 Hi everybody 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.180
 Where am I? 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.860
 I am in the studio 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.380
 Studio of LA Space Youtube 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.580
 See it! 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.440
 Today I will be making Korean Tea 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440
 It is made from ginseng and jujube 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
 It is called Insam Daechucha 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.480
 Have you ever heard of this? 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 Look at this! This is ginseng, 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.420
 Did it look like a human? 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.040
 Does it look like me? 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 I imitate it 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.320
 Fresh ginseng 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
 And this is the jujube 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 Repeat after me Ju-ju-be 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.080
 When I was young 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 My mother used to make this special dish 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500
 in the cold winter 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.600
 When I returned to school 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.100
 My mother said: "Hey hey 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 Drink some tea. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 It's cold outside, drink it. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 It is very good for the body " 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 She always said "it is very good for the body" 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.260
 Good thing 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.620
 I have made this tea regularly in winter 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.980
 for my family as my mother did 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.600
 Many people ask me that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.120
 Maangchi, what is ginseng tea? 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 Is ginseng packed in powder form? 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 No no no 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.520
 You can do it 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.440
 with fresh ginseng 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 This is fresh ginseng 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 But you can use it 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 dried ginseng 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.840
 The traditional way is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 You have to heat for hours 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.140
 Until the water turns a little reddish brown 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.920
 After that, pour out the pretty cup 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620
 and add honey 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.260
 Stir and enjoy 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 But I can't wait for hours 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.280
 I am very busy 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 So, this is my way to make it simpler 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400
 It is grinding everything 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.320
 Come on, grind everything. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.720
 And you can enjoy it right away 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.040
 Start! 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.540
 2 large and fresh ginseng 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
 1/2 pound jujube 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 1/2 cup of honey 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 Look, there's a little hat on top 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 We have to leave it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.960
 Why? 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 My mother said drinking it would produce too much heat 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 all these roots 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 Don't throw them away 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.400
 They are all precious 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.660
 This is a wrinkled jujube 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300
 But actually when they harvest, they are very round 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 Autumn is the harvest season 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.960
 But these fruits are already dry 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.420
 Inside it has a seed 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.040
 We have to give it up 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660
 First cut like this 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.420
 and you will see the seed 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 You slowly 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.220
 Use a knife to cut around like this 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
 Smells so sweet 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 I know some people are afraid of using knives 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.220
 uh oh 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 How can I handle a knife? 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.100
 So I will show you 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.120
 Just cut like this 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 This bunch of particles 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.660
 Throw them away 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 But if you 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.600
 I will give you another suggestion 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 Heat them with 1 cup of water 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.360
 10 minutes 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.980
 and enjoy 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120
 It is also Daechucha 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780
 This is my coffee grinder 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.580
 When you see 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
 This grinding mixture is quite sticky 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.900
 Continue to grind until the end 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420
 We have finished grinding 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
 Add 1/2 cup of honey 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440
 Smell the fragrance too 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.180
 Like the smell of herbs 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.580
 Please come in here 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.520
 Put in glass jars 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 Here is about 1 1/2 cup 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.320
 Now there are very nice tape types 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 This glass jar is very suitable 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.940
 Beautiful yet 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920
 It will be a cute gift 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.420
 I will make tea 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Pour in boiling water 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 A little more pine nuts 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.720
 I added more pine nuts 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860
 Scent of ginseng too 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.840
 Drink everyone 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720
 Oh yummy 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 Sweet sweet with bold ginseng taste 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.320
 pine nuts 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 I feel that I now have a lot of energy 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.500
 When you have a cold 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.540
 Or you feel stressed 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.280
 or lose energy 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.380
 Do this tea 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.400
 Enjoy my recipe 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.480
 See you again! Goodbye!
