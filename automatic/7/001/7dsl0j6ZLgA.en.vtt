you<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.530> well<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> think<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.580> education<00:02:32.150> is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
you know well I think the education is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.970 
you know well I think the education is
first<00:02:32.840> before<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.350> actually<00:02:33.709> tell<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
first before you actually tell the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
first before you actually tell the
person<00:02:34.280> what<00:02:34.459> they<00:02:34.640> need<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.209> grooming<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
person what they need like grooming and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.540 
person what they need like grooming and
this<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.950> lot<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.280> people

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
this and that because a lot of people

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.920 
this and that because a lot of people
don't<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.880> how<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.239> with<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> dog<00:02:38.690> so
