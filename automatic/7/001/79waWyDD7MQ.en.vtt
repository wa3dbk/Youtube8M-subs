00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.310
 Yes Well Hello 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:13.160
 I feel good body spills and what is this guy please 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.450
 It is training to make a Reine jump with volleyball and a big air thief Yes right now 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.869
 Until 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.039
 Have left the firm was kuk once you Once you have jumped it one action one of the operation in the air attitude 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.750
 Better was 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.930
 If it gets used to it, it's to work place 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.880
 We think that we want to say in the form of 3 actions 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 In short it is a continuous jump 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.700
 In the next jump along the barn in a certain jump again in the barn 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.210
 I am 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.160
 However the operation is also different 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 Please do it in a form that is different from all three 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 Will help considerably balance is disturbed by the wind in by doing so it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:03.160
 Disturbed not the fact that in terms of keeping the axis can make a stable air attitude is ultimately of stature force 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.240
 And it will lead to a jump 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.370
 Yes it's a motion I've put into action 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.830
 For example, the movement of the front or the movement of spreading 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.170
 Twisting movement 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 There were various movements to stretch 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:28.020
 At first it is to do two intellect as stable as possible 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:32.740
 Because operations such as moving away from the body, such as to match that spread the foot Toka or twist too much 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.220
 Too below that can be it will be a very difficult 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.000
 the body's 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.380
 Same movement on the underground side 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.990
 + 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.189
 Put the number and action 3 action 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.970
 I think that the person who is going to do is good at first 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:54.420
 I got used to 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:57.159
 For example, in the form of putting in the movement which is equal after putting this movement and opening at the end 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.609
 A more complex motion 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:06.789
 I think that if you can attach it, let's start by constructing similar movements first 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:13.900
 If you get used to various movements 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:17.180
 I think that it will be more exciting if you combine the movement that it is difficult to enter the next movement in particular 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.270
 So make a combination with that idea 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.830
 Yes I think 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.830
 Thank you very much
