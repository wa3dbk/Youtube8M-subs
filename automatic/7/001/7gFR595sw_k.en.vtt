and<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.630> Persians<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.530> forth<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.939> was

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and the Persians and so forth so it was

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.950 
and the Persians and so forth so it was
pretty<00:01:24.299> cool

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
pretty cool

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
pretty cool
I<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.560> figured<00:01:25.710> I'd<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I kind of figured I'd have to do it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450 
I kind of figured I'd have to do it
before<00:01:26.580> somebody<00:01:26.939> else<00:01:27.090> did<00:01:27.799> it's<00:01:28.799> true<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> did

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
before somebody else did it's true I did

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
before somebody else did it's true I did
I<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.700> enjoy<00:01:29.909> doing<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.600> own<00:01:30.780> valve<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.320> more

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I do enjoy doing my own valve it's more

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.649 
I do enjoy doing my own valve it's more
than<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.189> creating<00:01:32.720> somebody<00:01:33.720> else's<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
than we creating somebody else's but I

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.190 
than we creating somebody else's but I
kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> thought<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> would<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.110> an

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
kind of thought it would be an

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
kind of thought it would be an
interesting<00:01:37.439> challenge<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
interesting challenge to see what I

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
interesting challenge to see what I
could<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> couldn't<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> an

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
could do and couldn't do it's kind of an

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.590 
could do and couldn't do it's kind of an
interesting<00:01:41.520> shot<00:01:42.060> when<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.299> fell<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
interesting shot when they fell in the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.900 
interesting shot when they fell in the
water<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.290> didn't<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:44.009> use<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
water but I didn't I didn't use it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.160 
water but I didn't I didn't use it
it<00:01:45.910> was<00:01:46.030> obviously<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.360> shout<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.870> knock<00:01:47.020> them

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
it was obviously a shout to knock them

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.040 
it was obviously a shout to knock them
off<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.440> edge<00:01:47.620> but<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:49.390> one<00:01:49.630> didn't<00:01:49.900> work

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
off the edge but this one didn't work

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.720 
off the edge but this one didn't work
because<00:01:50.260> they<00:01:50.410> had<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.770> fall<00:01:51.010> towards<00:01:51.190> camera

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
because they had to fall towards camera

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.960 
because they had to fall towards camera
so<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.150> was<00:01:52.240> obvious<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:54.280> was<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.430> wee<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> bug

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
so it was obvious there was a wee a bug

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.120 
so it was obvious there was a wee a bug
sometimes<00:01:55.540> when<00:01:55.930> bodies<00:01:56.350> would<00:01:56.530> start<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.890> fly

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
sometimes when bodies would start to fly

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.250 
sometimes when bodies would start to fly
in<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.370> earth<00:01:57.520> because<00:01:58.270> all<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.540> slo-mo<00:01:59.050> was

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
in the earth because all the slo-mo was

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.140 
in the earth because all the slo-mo was
done<00:01:59.470> with<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.850> mod<00:02:02.400> which<00:02:03.400> was<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.580> spell<00:02:03.940> it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
done with a mod which was a spell it

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.670 
done with a mod which was a spell it
just<00:02:04.330> froze<00:02:04.570> time<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.170> could<00:02:05.320> turn<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.590> off

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
just froze time you could turn it off

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.240 
just froze time you could turn it off
and<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:05.980> like<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.370> matrix<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.220> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and on like the matrix and we have a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.650 
and on like the matrix and we have a
weird<00:02:09.580> book<00:02:09.790> where<00:02:10.030> people<00:02:10.330> would<00:02:10.420> start

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
weird book where people would start

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.090 
weird book where people would start
flying<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> earth<00:02:11.230> there's<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.830> screaming

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
flying in the earth there's a screaming

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.160 
flying in the earth there's a screaming
Persian<00:02:12.640> frozen<00:02:13.150> look<00:02:13.390> ridiculous<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.140> I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
Persian frozen look ridiculous so I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.410 
Persian frozen look ridiculous so I
didn't<00:02:14.410> use<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.090> didn't<00:02:16.090> want<00:02:16.240> him<00:02:16.360> to

what's<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.930> weird<00:02:32.140> AI<00:02:32.410> stuff<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.220> can't

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
what's a weird AI stuff that you can't

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.880 
what's a weird AI stuff that you can't
predict<00:02:33.910> because<00:02:34.900> obviously<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.440> game<00:02:35.620> isn't

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
predict because obviously the game isn't

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.540 
predict because obviously the game isn't
designed<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.190> do<00:02:36.310> any<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.730> stuff<00:02:38.550> it's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
designed to do any of this stuff it's

designed to do any of this stuff it's
kind<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.760> an<00:02:39.880> interest<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.300> shock<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.990> don't

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
kind of an interest in shock I don't

kind of an interest in shock I don't
know<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.980> didn't<00:02:42.220> use<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.270> kind

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
know I didn't use this because it's kind

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.230 
know I didn't use this because it's kind
of<00:02:43.540> cool<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:44.490> must<00:02:45.490> have<00:02:45.610> forgot<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.970> was<00:02:46.060> there

I had so much for it to sift through to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.550 
I had so much for it to sift through to
edit<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:49.600> obviously<00:02:49.959> some<00:02:50.140> stuff<00:02:50.380> got

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
predominately a lot of action sequences

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.970 
predominately a lot of action sequences
are<00:03:13.030> not<00:03:13.060> much<00:03:13.300> plot<00:03:13.660> but<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> fact<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.800> it's

historically<00:03:15.340> inaccurate<00:03:15.790> that's<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.630> point

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
historically inaccurate that's the point

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.560 
historically inaccurate that's the point
isn't<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.500> based<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.830> comic<00:03:18.330> which<00:03:19.330> was

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
happened if some awfully it's not

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.090 
happened if some awfully it's not
supposed<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.019> be<00:03:23.170> accurate<00:03:23.650> supposed<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.980> be

supposed to be accurate supposed to be
amiss<00:03:25.030> bit<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.110> The<00:03:26.200> Iliad<00:03:26.560> we<00:03:27.519> don't<00:03:27.700> know

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
amiss bit like The Iliad we don't know

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
do we there's a frozen version that and

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.560 
do we there's a frozen version that and
I<00:03:32.830> killed<00:03:33.070> in<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> oh<00:03:33.550> it<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.330> thought<00:03:34.450> like

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
I killed in it oh it just thought like

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.080 
I killed in it oh it just thought like

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
and then by then they had so many arrows

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.070 
and then by then they had so many arrows
stuck<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.760> them<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.000> looked<00:04:53.240> ridiculous<00:04:53.810> I

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
stuck in them it looked ridiculous I

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.560 
stuck in them it looked ridiculous I
mean<00:04:54.229> look<00:04:54.380> at<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:55.150> doesn't<00:04:56.150> take<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.450> many

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570

mean look at that doesn't take that many
hours<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.050> kill<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.289> guy

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
hours to kill a guy

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.120 
hours to kill a guy
in<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.270> end<00:04:59.419> I<00:04:59.539> had<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.720> get<00:04:59.870> another<00:05:00.110> mod<00:05:00.410> to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
in the end I had to get another mod to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.770 
in the end I had to get another mod to
make<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.400> arrows<00:05:01.669> killed<00:05:01.970> quicker<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.660> they

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
make the arrows killed quicker so they

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.989 
make the arrows killed quicker so they
died

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:03.999 
died

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.640 
died
but<00:05:04.999> yeah<00:05:05.180> so<00:05:05.780> hopefully<00:05:06.110> this<00:05:06.259> was<00:05:06.409> a<00:05:06.439> bit<00:05:06.590> of

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
but yeah so hopefully this was a bit of

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.709 
but yeah so hopefully this was a bit of
an<00:05:06.740> insight<00:05:07.099> into<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.490> hells<00:05:07.879> of<00:05:08.270> making<00:05:08.629> this

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
an insight into the hells of making this

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.330 
an insight into the hells of making this
video<00:05:08.900> there's<00:05:09.439> another<00:05:09.590> battle<00:05:09.800> bit<00:05:10.069> on<00:05:10.219> the
