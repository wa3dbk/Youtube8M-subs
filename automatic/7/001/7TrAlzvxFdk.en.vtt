 special section 284 kilometers 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.270
 the organizers display the truck route 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.550
 from public roads 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.529
 the beds of dried rivers begin and are very 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.210
 bad broken roads which are special 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.219
 endurance begins to play a role 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.829
 suspension starts participants at the height 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.079
 500 meters above sea level from start to 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.780

 finish at an altitude of about 1000 meters above 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.140
 My level despite the fact that Sergey 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.550
 lucky lost in general 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.559

 3 combat day for the maz-sport auto team 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.850
 ended with a very good result 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.179
 Alexander and Vladimir Vasilievich 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.100
 significantly improved their position machine 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.540
 Sergey Viz is equipped with the engine of the world 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.840
 Slavic Motor Plant power 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.820
 about 900 20 horsepower motor essentially 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.170
 is low purebred and on steep 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.049
 long rises where required 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.680
 instantaneous power returns 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.990
 counter high-speed 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.149
 thousand strong motor rivals nothing 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.040
 Yes, and the masses despite all the improvements 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.530
 heavier than major competitors by almost 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.479
 tons from here the natural lag on 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 two minutes from Nikolaev on 2 track 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.030
 points are the first 50 kilometers of the course 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 as soon as the road went down angry they teach 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.869
 played four positions at once and up to 5 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.320
 waypoint showed the third result 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.450
 giving the leader heroes just one minute 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.759
 From 5 way i to the finish road 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.810
 went up the hill and even turned 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.049
 solid potholes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.729
 will study began at the finish from Mardeev at 8 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.409
 minutes affected and the fact that for a detour 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.840
 slow and stopped cars 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.329
 I had to protect from the highway Valya bushes 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.979
 and trees we have with tail number 510 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.140
 arrived at the finish with a broken head-on 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.450
 glass in the general classification 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 visa in sixth place behind 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 leader on 8 th 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.770
 minutes 52 seconds today surprised everyone 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.680
 last year champion Andrei Kargin 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.070
 Balts 2 2 stages at the end of the ten 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.290
 in the third stage, he 2 the complexity of this 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.300
 stage confirmed and fallen average 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.630
 speed leader ayrata mardeeva on 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.080
 amounted to only 85 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.190
 lucky even less than 81 kilometer 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 Alexander Vasilevsky without a bitch and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.560
 hitch held us number 535 on the highway 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
 specially plot starting with 36 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.720
 positions already at the first waypoint he 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.830

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.500
 thirteenth and at the finish of the stage he took 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.820
 fifteenth place behind the leader by 37 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
 minutes 6 seconds 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.680
 great day all the same masses technically 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.530
 enter only three or four top 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.660
 the team of Vladimir Vasilevski also 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.170
 I wasted my time and in the course of the stage 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.230
 having started from position 35 I got to 31 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.540
 lagging behind the leader by 1 hour 28 minutes and 20 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.610
 seconds after three stages in the general 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.959
 KAMAZ classifications have reached the leading 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.090
 positions and the only one who could 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.450
 break into second place this price on 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.480
 mane number 503 respectively mardeev 1 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.190
 Karginov 3 Nikolay in 4 backlog 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.920
 Nikolaev is due to the fact that in the course of it 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.440
 he had to change a broken wheel 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.900
 on this replacement he lost 12 minutes 5 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 is the 3 and 6th Sergey lucky 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.200

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.700
 the sixteenth and Vladimir Vasilevsky 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.780
 allow and and alexander do not trudge for 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.040
 fighting my technicals which are in freight 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.130
 offset the bulk 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.380
 first dakar 2015 at the expense of trucks 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.660
 for technical reasons already left 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.430
 six cars but also team mechanics 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.140
 maz-sportavto every night making 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.510
 maximum effort to maintain 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.510
 cars in competitive condition
