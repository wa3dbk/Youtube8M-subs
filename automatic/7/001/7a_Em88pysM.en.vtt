00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.860
 the night was announced 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.530
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.950
 good today I bring you a new video of 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.119
 kirk was 2 a video about an event a 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.010
 event that I was waiting for already 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 long time to get here and good 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 ladies and gentlemen and first dragon 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 let's go after him these are these are the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 events that are expected at a higher level in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 guild wars 2 is the first dragon to which 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.000
 I can kill I do not see many people I hope 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.490
 that there are enough people because it seems 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.170
 hard the truth 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.290
 more when I see nothing I do not see anything I do not see 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.290
 nothing 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.290
 there is 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.290
 let's give it 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.830
 of 2 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.150
 good little life is left actually comes 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 a tad late 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 what attack a lot or little truth 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 what do you do what you do what you do 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.659
 as the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.909
 I do not know how he looks at the fps is quite 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.460
 ass 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.780
 quickly evacuate let's go down 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 let's go down quickly 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.040
 medium medium in shadows some salts 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 low expectation none 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.540
 I hope you have improved something 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.100
 approaching that I am with the two swords 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.100
 with the scale rather the two hands 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.030
 This 'not good' is still studied better 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.030
 I hit him with the bow that assures me 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.060
 go that is small fuck 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.990
 let's remove the interface 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 so it's giving the days 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.570
 we're going a bit longer 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.620
 you have thrown fear good 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.240
 If we are already so many that we do not kill him 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.900
 Well, the people are already down, the dragon is already 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.900
 eyes 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.420
 see you later 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.519
 I do not care who is the reward 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.560
 it's true that he's a little late and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.140
 hardly hurt so I do not know what I 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.750
 they will give but we will see good 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.670
 delighted I hope to see more dragons in 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.099
 other areas here are inviting me the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.500
 and good people because this has been my 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.420
 killing of the first dragon I hope to see 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.640
 many more in the journey that I have left 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.380
 up to level 80 and good then at level 80 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.060
 and of course going back to these sites for 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.420
 kill the dragons all that go 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.799
 coming out and well really light then not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.239
 I know what happened the reward at the end 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.569
 I have not been given anything, I do not know if it is 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.340
 because a little damage that is surely going to 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.040
 be that because of course as entered already 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.959
 when the box was a quarter of life 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.880
 and also with the bow was hardly hurt 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.980
 surely that's why he did not send anything 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.989
 but good people, this has been the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.760
 video that I wanted to bring you finally we have 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.349
 attacked a dragon that is what he wanted 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.910
 do and nothing we see in the next 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.530

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.790
 like added to your favorites and we 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.790
