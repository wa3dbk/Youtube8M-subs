00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
struggle for birth gravity inertia

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.069 
struggle for birth gravity inertia
physics<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> round-robin<00:00:48.079> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
physics it's like a round-robin the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
physics it's like a round-robin the
unborn<00:00:49.379> child<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> real<00:00:50.309> number<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
unborn child is like a real number it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.740 
unborn child is like a real number it
cannot<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> divided<00:00:51.809> by<00:00:51.989> 0<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
cannot be divided by 0 think about that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
cannot be divided by 0 think about that
so<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.870> very<00:00:55.160> philosophical<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so it's very philosophical so it's a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
so it's very philosophical so it's a
nice<00:00:57.719> precursor<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.829> game<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
nice precursor to what this game is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.840 
nice precursor to what this game is
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.670> about<00:01:01.489> right<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> left

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
going to be all about right and left

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
going to be all about right and left
arrow<00:01:03.059> keys<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.329> steer<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> press<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
