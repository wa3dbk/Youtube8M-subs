00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the bolt is originally at so everybody's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
the bolt is originally at so everybody's
going<00:01:48.240> back<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> larger<00:01:48.990> washer<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.560> top

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going back with a larger washer on top

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.520 
going back with a larger washer on top
just<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.149> case<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> flop<00:01:51.960> down<00:01:52.229> here

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
just just in case if you flop down here

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.920 
just just in case if you flop down here
you<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.740> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> create<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.600> risk<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you don't want to create a risk or a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.039 
you don't want to create a risk or a
chance<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.530> splitting<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> boat<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.020> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
chance of splitting the boat right there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.490 
chance of splitting the boat right there
so<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> half<00:02:00.060> inch<00:02:00.500> quarter

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so we put a two and a half inch quarter

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
so we put a two and a half inch quarter

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
the boat to a third Cantina right there

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.920 
the boat to a third Cantina right there
and<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:11.389> slides<00:04:12.389> up<00:04:12.739> down<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.889> boat<00:04:14.479> I<00:04:15.479> don't

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
and this slides up down the boat I don't

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.839 
and this slides up down the boat I don't
use<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.409> a<00:04:16.560> whole<00:04:16.769> lot<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.070> when<00:04:17.219> I<00:04:17.250> do<00:04:17.340> use<00:04:17.699> it

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
use it a whole lot but when I do use it

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.279 
use it a whole lot but when I do use it
it's<00:04:17.969> very<00:04:18.030> useful<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.719> it<00:04:18.780> was<00:04:18.870> very<00:04:19.169> very

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's very useful and it was very very

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.550 
it's very useful and it was very very
cheap<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.680> spent<00:04:19.919> $6<00:04:20.639> so<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.659> got<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.409> both

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
cheap I spent $6 so I got it on both

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.689 
cheap I spent $6 so I got it on both
sides<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.039> boat<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.340> they're<00:04:23.520> very

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
sides of the boat and they're very

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.820 
sides of the boat and they're very
effective<00:04:24.270> every<00:04:25.260> time<00:04:25.409> I'm<00:04:25.500> using<00:04:25.650> that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
effective every time I'm using that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.670 
effective every time I'm using that
worked<00:04:26.010> out<00:04:26.099> great

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
worked out great

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.340 
worked out great
you<00:04:28.680> hear<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.479> little<00:04:30.479> noisy<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:31.139> they're

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
you hear that a little noisy if they're

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.629 
you hear that a little noisy if they're
in<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.500> right<00:04:31.620> position<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.160> wind's<00:04:32.490> blowing

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
in the right position the wind's blowing

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.270 
in the right position the wind's blowing
you<00:04:33.020> kind<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.080> hits<00:04:34.259> in<00:04:34.410> there<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.680> to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
you kind of hits in there like that to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.779 
you kind of hits in there like that to
this<00:04:35.400> aluminum<00:04:35.639> track<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.860> that's<00:04:38.639> the

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
this aluminum track and so that's the

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.460 
this aluminum track and so that's the
only<00:04:39.090> complaint<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.630> with<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:39.900> setup<00:04:40.139> so

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
only complaint I have with this setup so

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.930 
only complaint I have with this setup so
I'm<00:04:40.590> probably<00:04:40.860> gonna<00:04:41.039> put<00:04:41.250> some<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.550> solid

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
I'm probably gonna put some that solid

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.469 
I'm probably gonna put some that solid
traction<00:04:42.360> stuff<00:04:43.110> on<00:04:43.289> here<00:04:43.669> they'll<00:04:44.669> be<00:04:44.759> less

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
traction stuff on here they'll be less

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.999 
traction stuff on here they'll be less
noisy<00:04:45.870> now<00:04:46.020> when<00:04:46.199> I'm<00:04:46.320> just<00:04:46.530> paddling<00:04:46.919> around

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
noisy now when I'm just paddling around

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.460 
noisy now when I'm just paddling around
and<00:04:47.370> I'm<00:04:47.430> not<00:04:47.580> using<00:04:47.820> this<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.810> sits<00:04:49.169> right<00:04:49.320> in

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
and I'm not using this it sits right in

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.629 
and I'm not using this it sits right in
there<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.770> doesn't<00:04:50.039> make<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.160> sound<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.580> never

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
there and doesn't make a sound I never

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.700 
there and doesn't make a sound I never
had<00:04:51.120> any<00:04:51.270> problems<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> at<00:04:52.050> all<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.470> it's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
had any problems with it at all and it's

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.189 
had any problems with it at all and it's
super<00:04:53.009> simple<00:04:53.190> just<00:04:53.610> got<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.720> little<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:55.169> of

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
super simple just got that little can of

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.529 
super simple just got that little can of
eNOS<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.889> rope<00:04:56.070> there<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.090> same<00:04:57.300> thing

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
eNOS and rope there and the same thing

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.189 
eNOS and rope there and the same thing
over<00:04:57.690> here

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
over here

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.249 
over here
and<00:04:59.360> just<00:05:00.360> ran<00:05:00.570> out<00:05:00.690> link<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.900> rope<00:05:01.110> between

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
and just ran out link the rope between

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.100 
and just ran out link the rope between
the<00:05:01.530> two<00:05:01.759> have<00:05:02.759> a<00:05:02.820> tension<00:05:03.150> knot<00:05:03.449> right<00:05:03.660> here<00:05:03.720> I

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
the two have a tension knot right here I

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.260 
the two have a tension knot right here I
can<00:05:04.470> loosen<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:04.919> side<00:05:05.130> up<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.090> can

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
can loosen this side up and I can

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.120 
can loosen this side up and I can
increase<00:05:06.570> or<00:05:07.020> decrease<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.380> tension<00:05:07.919> on<00:05:08.070> the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
increase or decrease the tension on the

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.770 
increase or decrease the tension on the
rope<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> let<00:05:08.580> sag<00:05:08.910> or<00:05:09.150> tighten<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.479> nut<00:05:09.599> more

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
rope and let sag or tighten the nut more

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.080 
rope and let sag or tighten the nut more
I<00:05:09.990> like<00:05:10.380> it<00:05:10.500> tighten<00:05:10.830> up<00:05:10.889> out<00:05:11.039> of<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.250> way

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.150 

that's<00:05:15.090> pretty<00:05:15.330> much<00:05:15.599> look<00:05:16.500> at<00:05:16.530> my<00:05:16.740> commander

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
that's pretty much look at my commander

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.990

against<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:30.990> edge<00:05:31.199> my<00:05:31.409> biggest<00:05:31.620> complaint

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
against this edge my biggest complaint

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.129 
against this edge my biggest complaint
if<00:05:32.400> any<00:05:32.580> if<00:05:32.820> any<00:05:33.000> at<00:05:33.150> all<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.570> just<00:05:33.810> this<00:05:33.900> edge

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
if any if any at all is just this edge

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.649 
if any if any at all is just this edge
right<00:05:34.380> here<00:05:34.440> needs<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.800> be<00:05:34.860> covered<00:05:35.400> because

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
right here needs to be covered because

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:41.029 
right here needs to be covered because
it<00:05:36.659> is<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.900> paddle<00:05:37.620> killer<00:05:38.030> so<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.800> think<00:05:40.800> that

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
it is a paddle killer so I think that

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.330 
it is a paddle killer so I think that
just<00:05:41.070> about<00:05:41.460> does<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.729> for<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.150> commander
