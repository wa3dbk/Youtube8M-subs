got two whole counts for your untwist
let's<00:01:32.490> try<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.060> from<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.690> previous

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
let's try that again from the previous

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.940 
let's try that again from the previous
section<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:34.740> eight<00:01:35.460> five<00:01:36.060> six<00:01:36.780> seven<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.890> we

section and eight five six seven here we
go<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.610> eight<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:41.030> roll<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.240> round<00:01:42.420> two

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
go and eight and one roll it round two

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.130 
go and eight and one roll it round two
three<00:01:44.370> from<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.610> +<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.030> open<00:01:48.990> it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
three from here and + and open it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.820 
three from here and + and open it's
almost<00:01:49.620> like<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.280> swimming<00:01:51.440> right<00:01:52.440> leg
