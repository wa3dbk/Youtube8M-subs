 hello my name is khan and my name 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.819
 to fifth game platts platts 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.170
 community challenge welcome 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.030
 I have one a few weeks ago 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.679
 Survey started what the topic 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.780
 this challenge should be 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.500
 Programmers were available to choose from 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.090
 play under a megabyte with yourself 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.190
 photographed graphics with the theme 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.550
 Time pressure or programmer a game 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.570
 with graphics given by me and 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 Now I have to ask for a moment 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.250
 are the results already there ? 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.370
 straight thick chains the results please 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.890
 right 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 I made her this animation and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.300
 they can take a look 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.500
 And that is the theme of the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 fifth game plus plus community 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.110
 challenge is programmer a game 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.460
 with given graphics could so 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.369
 equal to the rules 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.479
 The rules are of course almost as 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.080
 every time 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:17.030
 The deadline for entries is 26 november 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.190
 23 o'clock and 59 minutes must sounds 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.009
 be created by yourself or at least 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.619
 free to use his meaning can you 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.909
 open house open sound libraries 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.729
 download 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.570
 You can be alone or in a team 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 work 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.350
 You are only allowed to use graphics that I have 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.360
 you available 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.850
 But you will learn more about this in more detail 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.890
 you can use any programming language and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.910
 So any framework on the use 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.960
 gaming community cycle plus ruby ​​soon 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.570
 a field 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.460
 you can not submit a game which 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 you already filed ever before 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.840
 hate and only exchange the graphics 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.149
 You also have to play your game in a 60 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130
 Present a second video like that 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.990
 video needs to be built up, you know 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 here in this link the link is 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.009
 of course in the video description 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.840
 and the link to your video to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.899
 Please send me on time then 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 on net game dev at gmx.de 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.450
 I have some graphics here too 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.330
 provided for download 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.489
 You are only allowed to use these graphics 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.660
 you can not create yourself 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.239
 use graphics 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.220
 you may not use the graphics 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.620
 get somewhere for free to get down 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.650
 you may not use the graphics 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.140
 somewhere with the car you can 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.540
 only the graphics use you here 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.340
 but you can download it 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.349
 Of course, exceptions 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.980
 you can write your own font 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.319
 use a cool font 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.269
 generator of the bitmap funds 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.760
 I linked here below you are allowed too 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.989
 simple large-scale geometric 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.600
 use forms 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.340
 that is, if you have the big red ones now 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.860
 want to create button on the play 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 it is not a topic you are allowed 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.180
 but not now many 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.190
 geometric shapes new objects 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.069
 put together like for example something like that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.480
 here you clearly only have rectangles 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.450
 used but you have a complete 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.510
 new created wide and that does not work 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.910
 where the border is, you should be clear 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.079
 may also take my graphics and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.150
 change them 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.519
 that is, you can change the color 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.450
 you can delete parts you can 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.579
 combine 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.739
 you can change the aspect ratio you 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.570
 You can not twist a problem 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.920
 but not for example this graphic 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.109
 this this this piece of this 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.370
 Graphics and build on it something that that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.650
 is not at all meaningful and purposeful at all 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.290
 the thing what sense and purpose of the thing 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.000
 For example, such things are like that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.320
 what can be built from that sees everything 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.209
 a little stupid but that is 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.359
 yes, especially the challenge of this 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.980
 challenge i think the rules are clear 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.569
 they should not be you 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.209
 course below in the video 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.880
 description do not ask your question 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.880
 Of course, they are allowed to play 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.609
 So the console runs in the terminal in 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.670
 the dosbox as you like because they are 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.859
 yes ski games so play with the text 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.069
 and pays to do and no games 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.890
 the graphics exist 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.170
 So my graphics have to be used 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.720
 become 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.760
 since the hard-working programmer always yes 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.530
 the urge feels better and better 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.810
 will this time be a book too 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.110
 win a super can read the book 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.420
 is less bad programming and 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.300
 I think that helps us all 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.630
 a very nice book in which you can not 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.100
 just learn how to pay attention to code 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.200
 but also how to be interpersonal 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.040
 between programmers has to pay attention 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.870
 So what and also that one his 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.730
 own code understands and that you look 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.530
 even a joy makes very nice 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.270
 The winner's book will be about it 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.860
 Very happy is a donkey on it from 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.080
 o'reilly verlag us was written 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.240
 by kathrin passig and johannes janda 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.350
 also women can be in computer science 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.150
 succeed 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.910
 I wish you good luck in that 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.680
 this very curious community challenge 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.120
 and if you do not know exactly how yours 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.970
 video should not forget here 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.340
 click on the video and there he will 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.560
 again explains how such a video 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.210
 such a presentation video should look like 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.160
 as well as later in the livestream 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.340
 good at analyzing and understanding 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.050
 because sometimes the video is not like that 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.350
 become too soft or too soft 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.490
 we just do not understand because too 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.400
 complicated or just not good 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.730
 was declared and the resolution too small 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.620
 was 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.750
 because you will explain what you reasonably 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.520
 should and should be in there 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.370
 nothing is going to happen without it 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.230
 all other submissions the humor 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:48.890
 compete 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:51.830
 yes yes yes yes I come I have come 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.870
 yes that was nice go make it clean and 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.420
 that's nice 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.420
 no not no that's at the polo
