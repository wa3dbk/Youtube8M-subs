back<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.590> something<00:00:43.920> I'll<00:00:44.129> wait<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
back for something I'll wait for a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.490 
back for something I'll wait for a
moment<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.230> waiting<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> waiting<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this is really peculiar because the deli

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
this is really peculiar because the deli
is<00:00:55.559> open<00:00:55.860> until<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.489> store<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.820> closed<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is open until the store is closed so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
is open until the store is closed so

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
like why is there no one here and I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.439 
like why is there no one here and I
suddenly<00:01:00.270> heard<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.410> quiet<00:01:01.980> sound<00:01:02.579> very
