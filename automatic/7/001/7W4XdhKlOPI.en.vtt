significant increase and strange

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.680 
significant increase and strange
considering<00:02:20.140> its<00:02:20.440> AR<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.160> about<00:02:21.430> 100<00:02:21.819> lower<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
considering its AR is about 100 lower so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.300 
considering its AR is about 100 lower so
I'm<00:02:23.319> gonna<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> say<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> damage

now<00:02:51.640> its<00:02:52.000> cons<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.750> bet<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.260> say<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.590> the

now its cons I bet to say that the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.620 
now its cons I bet to say that the
biggest<00:02:53.920> con<00:02:54.220> would<00:02:54.519> be<00:02:54.670> its<00:02:54.880> our<00:02:55.090> two<00:02:55.269> attacks

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
biggest con would be its our two attacks

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.220 
biggest con would be its our two attacks
and<00:02:55.900> although<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:57.099> significantly<00:02:58.090> more

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
and although they are significantly more

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.770

so<00:03:58.010> yeah<00:03:58.489> other<00:03:58.880> pounds<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.930> the<00:03:59.989> weapon<00:04:00.290> I

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
so yeah other pounds of the weapon I

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.229 
so yeah other pounds of the weapon I
would<00:04:00.980> have<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.190> say<00:04:01.340> it's<00:04:01.459> weight<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> kind

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.000 
would have to say it's weight is a kind
considering<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.870> is<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.140> second<00:04:03.500> heaviest<00:04:03.830> of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
I don't know why but oh well

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.170 
I don't know why but oh well
so<00:04:21.260> other<00:04:21.680> than<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.430> would<00:04:22.790> have<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.000> say

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
so other than that I would have to say

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.240 
so other than that I would have to say
even<00:04:23.810> though<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.260> a<00:04:24.380> minor<00:04:24.590> thing<00:04:24.919> when

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
even though it's just a minor thing when

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.590 
even though it's just a minor thing when
you're<00:04:25.370> doing<00:04:25.610> are<00:04:25.790> ones<00:04:26.060> with<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.419> weapon

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
you're doing are ones with this weapon

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.040 
you're doing are ones with this weapon
it's<00:04:27.500> one<00:04:28.070> handed<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.880> two<00:04:29.450> handed<00:04:29.720> are<00:04:29.840> ones

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
it's one handed and two handed are ones

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.620 
it's one handed and two handed are ones
the<00:04:30.620> first<00:04:30.830> swing<00:04:31.310> has<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:31.970> longer<00:04:32.419> reach<00:04:32.570> than

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
the first swing has a longer reach than

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.400 
the first swing has a longer reach than
the<00:04:33.110> second<00:04:33.470> why<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:35.260> don't<00:04:36.260> really

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
the second why that is I don't really

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.529 
the second why that is I don't really
know<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.650> way<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:39.919> oh<00:04:40.700> well

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
know it just it is that way so oh well

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.690 
know it just it is that way so oh well
if<00:04:42.110> someone<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:42.770> out<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:42.979> your<00:04:43.100> reach<00:04:43.220> and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
if someone is just out of your reach and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.550 
if someone is just out of your reach and
you<00:04:44.090> try<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:44.510> combo<00:04:44.960> them<00:04:45.110> you'll<00:04:45.320> leave

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
you try and combo them you'll leave

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.680 
you try and combo them you'll leave
yourself<00:04:45.740> open<00:04:46.070> your<00:04:46.550> width<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.120> then<00:04:47.479> that's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
yourself open your width and then that's

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.360 
yourself open your width and then that's
bad<00:04:47.930> news<00:04:47.960> for<00:04:48.350> you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
bad news for you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.159 
bad news for you
one<00:04:49.880> more<00:04:50.000> good<00:04:50.210> thing<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.510> actually<00:04:50.660> forgot<00:04:51.050> to

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
one more good thing I actually forgot to

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.990 
one more good thing I actually forgot to
mention<00:04:51.289> it's<00:04:51.620> rolling<00:04:52.010> attacks<00:04:52.310> are<00:04:52.580> very

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
mention it's rolling attacks are very

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.909 
mention it's rolling attacks are very
good<00:04:53.240> at<00:04:53.360> dead<00:04:53.539> angling<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.470> that's<00:04:54.620> something

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
good at dead angling so that's something

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.500 
good at dead angling so that's something
else<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.220> keep<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.460> mind<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.150> sounds<00:04:56.390> like

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
else to keep in mind and it sounds like

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.210 
else to keep in mind and it sounds like
my<00:04:56.660> girlfriend's<00:04:57.110> done<00:04:57.289> dry<00:04:57.500> her<00:04:57.710> hair<00:04:57.770> so<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
my girlfriend's done dry her hair so I

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.040 
my girlfriend's done dry her hair so I
really<00:04:58.880> don't<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.150> much<00:04:59.419> time<00:04:59.630> good<00:04:59.870> thing

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
really don't have much time good thing

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.420 
really don't have much time good thing
there's<00:05:00.229> only<00:05:00.440> about<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.710> minute<00:05:00.919> left<00:05:01.160> for<00:05:01.310> me

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
there's only about a minute left for me

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.730 
there's only about a minute left for me
to<00:05:01.460> do<00:05:01.640> commentary

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to do commentary

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.250 
to do commentary
okay<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:05.060> pretty<00:05:05.360> much<00:05:05.450> actually<00:05:05.900> sums

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
okay so that pretty much actually sums

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.310 
okay so that pretty much actually sums
everything<00:05:06.470> up<00:05:07.150> strangely<00:05:08.150> enough<00:05:08.330> right

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
everything up strangely enough right

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.380 
everything up strangely enough right
there<00:05:09.350> like<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.680> little<00:05:09.979> -<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:10.610> did<00:05:10.820> so

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
there like that little - I just did so

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.080 
there like that little - I just did so
anyway<00:05:11.780> just<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.260> quickly<00:05:12.470> recap<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.669> biggest

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
anyway just to quickly recap the biggest

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.390 
anyway just to quickly recap the biggest
pro<00:05:14.600> of<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.140> weapon<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.680> would<00:05:15.979> have<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.220> say

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
pro of the weapon I would have to say

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.430 
pro of the weapon I would have to say
would<00:05:16.550> be<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.910> damage<00:05:17.090> output<00:05:17.440> considering

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
would be the damage output considering

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440 
would be the damage output considering
the<00:05:18.530> fact<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.770> it's<00:05:18.950> deceiving<00:05:19.520> for<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.030> AR

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
the fact that it's deceiving for the AR

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.330 
the fact that it's deceiving for the AR
that<00:05:20.660> this<00:05:20.810> has<00:05:20.990> mean<00:05:21.650> earlier<00:05:21.950> in<00:05:22.039> this<00:05:22.190> fight

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
that this has mean earlier in this fight

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.969

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
I had a 440 with a two-handed r1 my AR

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.420 
I had a 440 with a two-handed r1 my AR
is<00:05:25.340> just<00:05:25.610> over<00:05:25.880> 500<00:05:26.560> usually<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.740> is<00:05:27.919> enough

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
is just over 500 usually that is enough

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.469 
is just over 500 usually that is enough
case<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:29.380> yeah<00:05:30.380> that's<00:05:30.650> that's<00:05:30.949> a<00:05:31.100> good<00:05:31.220> thing

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479
