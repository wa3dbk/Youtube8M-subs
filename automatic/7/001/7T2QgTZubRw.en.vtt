00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.699
 hello everyone is quentin for 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.770
 android pitt we put there are some 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.330
 days you know the bike ji in the water 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.539
 to see if it was really waterproof 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.829
 as some users the announced 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.999
 actually it worked well there is 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.829
 no problem with this smartphone 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.179
 today we will try with the bike x 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.050
 and we will watch what happens 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 twenty-four hours after 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.120
 so let's see this motorcycle x after the five 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.980
 minutes of immersion 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.230
 as you can see he was 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.510
 still lit so we have it and am a 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.739
 little we have tried to screens 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.829
 tactile because it's a component 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 which can open up quite a bit with the water I 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.449
 let's see that's it still works 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 then we waited 24 hours to see 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.699
 what it gives us here we are 24 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.210
 hours after the bike x runs 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.559
 always 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.409
 so I remind you is not 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.729
 officially a waterproof smartphone 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.440
 the touch screen no problem I you 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.429
 said that it could suffer it works 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 Well, here is no problem we will test 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.390
 also the camera that can 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.530
 also suffer all the parties in 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.570
 party or water can lodge 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.710
 in fact it can suffer have no 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.039
 worry with the camera that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.289
 works we will also test a 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.909
 other critical point the speakers has 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.190
 launched a little youtube video to see 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.390
 that if water is lodged in the sound 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.899
 can be altered or at worst outright 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 no longer work at all so there no 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.520
 problem a priori a whole thing works 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.570
 as you could see the x mode 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.700
 just like the dgi and values bikes 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.900
 proof motorola does not announce its 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.760
 smartphones like water resistant 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.800
 yet they are it is rather a 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.480
 good news anyway we're going 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880
 wait another one to two weeks 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.080
 stay on the spot because of 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.570
 oxidation that could be at 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.550
 microphone speaker level others 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 other components might have some 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.010
 troubles 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.720
