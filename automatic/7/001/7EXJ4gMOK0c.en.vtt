in order to be competitive you have to
run<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:51.960> ragged<00:04:52.169> edge<00:04:52.409> but<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> have<00:04:53.009> to

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
run on the ragged edge but you have to

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.339 
run on the ragged edge but you have to
run<00:04:53.250> clean<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.789> one<00:04:54.000> mistake<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.569> not<00:04:55.110> only<00:04:55.229> in

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
a aggressive category and a conservative

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.860

category<00:05:00.000> there's<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.300> few<00:05:00.509> guys<00:05:00.629> out<00:05:00.810> there

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
category there's a few guys out there

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.649 
category there's a few guys out there
that<00:05:01.169> are<00:05:01.560> somewhat<00:05:01.830> conservative<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:03.449> if

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
that are somewhat conservative and if

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.909 
that are somewhat conservative and if
they<00:05:03.780> go<00:05:03.900> on<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.110> finish<00:05:04.199> top<00:05:04.500> ten<00:05:04.740> they're

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
they go on and finish top ten they're

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.059 
they go on and finish top ten they're
happy<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.669> more<00:05:05.849> aggressive<00:05:06.060> drivers<00:05:07.069> are

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
happy the more aggressive drivers are

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.290 
happy the more aggressive drivers are
able<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.340> build<00:05:08.520> more<00:05:08.729> speed<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.240> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
able to build more speed in the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.640 
able to build more speed in the
straightaway<00:05:09.659> because<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.139> boat<00:05:10.349> is<00:05:10.469> much

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
straightaway because the boat is much

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.920 
straightaway because the boat is much
looser<00:05:10.949> what<00:05:11.879> I<00:05:11.909> mean<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.300> it's<00:05:12.449> higher<00:05:12.659> out<00:05:12.900> of

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
looser what I mean is it's higher out of

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.809 
looser what I mean is it's higher out of
the<00:05:13.080> water<00:05:13.319> from<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:13.979> front<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.400> sponson

friction<00:05:18.419> there<00:05:18.659> is<00:05:18.689> more<00:05:19.259> speed<00:05:19.500> you're<00:05:19.650> able

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
friction there is more speed you're able

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.850 
friction there is more speed you're able
to<00:05:19.919> build<00:05:20.099> them<00:05:20.219> straightaway<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.409> get

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
to build them straightaway if you get

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.830 
to build them straightaway if you get
the<00:05:22.979> balance<00:05:23.430> point<00:05:23.669> tipped<00:05:24.419> in<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.629> wrong

the balance point tipped in the wrong

the balance point tipped in the wrong
direction

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
direction

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.809

then<00:05:25.860> you're<00:05:26.069> going<00:05:26.189> to<00:05:26.279> get<00:05:26.460> in<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.669> air

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
then you're going to get in the air

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.740 
then you're going to get in the air
that's<00:05:27.090> going<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.360> be<00:05:27.449> really<00:05:27.659> nasty

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
that's going to be really nasty

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.629 
that's going to be really nasty

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
edge and if you get a little bit too far

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.459 
edge and if you get a little bit too far
over<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.389> edge<00:05:49.509> obviously<00:05:50.259> you're<00:05:50.379> getting

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
over the edge obviously you're getting

over the edge obviously you're getting
too<00:05:50.710> much<00:05:50.740> air<00:05:51.099> under<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.400> boat<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:52.060> it's

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
too much air under the boat and it's

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.270 
too much air under the boat and it's
going<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:52.479> blow<00:05:52.659> over<00:05:52.900> that's<00:05:53.740> what<00:05:53.979> we<00:05:54.099> all

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
going to blow over that's what we all

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.939 
going to blow over that's what we all
try<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.610> do<00:05:54.879> is<00:05:55.000> keep<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.330> right<00:05:55.479> on<00:05:55.629> the<00:05:55.780> edge<00:05:55.949> a

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
try to do is keep it right on the edge a

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.469 
try to do is keep it right on the edge a
lot<00:05:57.280> of<00:05:57.400> times<00:05:57.610> if<00:05:57.789> the<00:05:57.879> speeds<00:05:58.150> we're<00:05:58.270> running

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
lot of times if the speeds we're running

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.520 
lot of times if the speeds we're running
at<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.629> end<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.870> straightaways<00:05:59.289> it's

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
at the end of the straightaways it's

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.200 
at the end of the straightaways it's
hard<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.830> feel<00:05:59.979> if<00:06:00.129> you're<00:06:00.250> going<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.430> if<00:06:01.060> it's

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
hard to feel if you're going to if it's

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.459 
hard to feel if you're going to if it's
going<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.419> blow<00:06:01.599> over<00:06:01.629> it's<00:06:01.990> usually<00:06:02.110> going<00:06:02.349> to

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
going to blow over it's usually going to

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.600 
going to blow over it's usually going to
go<00:06:02.560> but<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:02.800> definitely<00:06:03.039> want<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.340> be<00:06:03.430> on<00:06:03.520> the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
go but you definitely want to be on the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.899 
go but you definitely want to be on the
edge<00:06:03.729> most<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.210> time<00:06:05.580> what<00:06:06.580> happens<00:06:06.849> is

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
edge most of the time what happens is

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.189 
edge most of the time what happens is
when<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.150> get<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.330> high<00:06:07.599> everything<00:06:08.050> gets

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
when you get to high everything gets

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.990 
when you get to high everything gets
quiet<00:06:08.319> and<00:06:09.159> that's<00:06:09.460> how<00:06:09.550> you<00:06:09.610> know<00:06:09.819> it's

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
quiet and that's how you know it's

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.459 
quiet and that's how you know it's
pretty<00:06:10.120> much<00:06:10.240> over<00:06:10.449> and<00:06:10.960> what<00:06:11.110> happens<00:06:11.379> after

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
pretty much over and what happens after

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:26.839 
pretty much over and what happens after
that<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:12.069> see<00:06:12.250> sky<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:12.699> then<00:06:12.789> water
