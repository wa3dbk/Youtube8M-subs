near on this one the vocals on it
dragged<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.639> little<00:04:32.000> bit<00:04:32.090> at<00:04:32.210> times<00:04:32.480> but

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
dragged a little bit at times but

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.600 
dragged a little bit at times but
honestly<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.620> still<00:04:33.860> feels<00:04:34.130> like<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.490> gonna

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610

be one of my favorites on this record in

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.650 
be one of my favorites on this record in
the<00:04:36.710> long<00:04:36.889> run<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.550> think<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.150> track<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
the long run I think the track the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.180 
the long run I think the track the
physical<00:04:39.139> world<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.560> title<00:04:39.889> track<00:04:40.160> is

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
physical world the title track is

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.730 
physical world the title track is
another<00:04:40.669> one<00:04:40.910> that's<00:04:41.120> very<00:04:41.270> experimental<00:04:41.990> but

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
another one that's very experimental but

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.040 
another one that's very experimental but
also<00:04:42.950> kind<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.520> Nakul<00:04:43.880> wait<00:04:44.090> at<00:04:44.360> first<00:04:44.840> I

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
also kind of a Nakul wait at first I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.050 
also kind of a Nakul wait at first I
didn't<00:04:45.260> like<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.560> fact<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:46.010> this<00:04:46.520> big

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
didn't like the fact that this big

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.270 
didn't like the fact that this big
building<00:04:47.540> sense<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.440> starts<00:04:48.770> off<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.040> song

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
building sense that starts off the song

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860 
building sense that starts off the song
almost<00:04:49.730> sounding<00:04:50.120> like<00:04:50.240> something<00:04:50.630> kind<00:04:50.810> of

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
almost sounding like something kind of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.050 
almost sounding like something kind of
straight<00:04:51.200> out<00:04:51.230> of<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.560> videogame<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.760> kind

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
straight out of a videogame it just kind

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.180 
straight out of a videogame it just kind
of<00:04:53.150> crashes<00:04:53.690> into<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:53.990> wall<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.410> guitars<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.160> I

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
of crashes into a wall of guitars and I

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.710 
of crashes into a wall of guitars and I
still<00:04:55.430> don't<00:04:55.610> think<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.850> that<00:04:56.060> flows<00:04:56.450> that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
still don't think that that flows that

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.870 
still don't think that that flows that
well<00:04:56.930> but<00:04:57.530> honestly<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:58.190> rest<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:58.580> track

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
well but honestly the rest of this track

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.820 
well but honestly the rest of this track
kind<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.240> makes<00:04:59.450> up<00:04:59.660> for<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:00.020> nothing<00:05:00.620> left

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
kind of makes up for that nothing left

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.770 
kind of makes up for that nothing left
inversions<00:05:01.250> are<00:05:01.639> two<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:01.940> my<00:05:01.970> least<00:05:02.240> favorites

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
inversions are two of my least favorites

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.020 
inversions are two of my least favorites
here<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.230> album<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.860> think<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.730> reason

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
here on this album I think the reason

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.550 
here on this album I think the reason
virgin's<00:05:05.480> doesn't<00:05:05.840> quite<00:05:06.020> click<00:05:06.230> with<00:05:06.440> me

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
virgin's doesn't quite click with me

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.960 
virgin's doesn't quite click with me
just<00:05:07.010> because<00:05:07.220> there's<00:05:07.430> not<00:05:07.669> enough

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
that dark feel about it a little bit of

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.420 
that dark feel about it a little bit of
cynicism<00:05:14.419> that<00:05:15.020> feels<00:05:15.260> like<00:05:15.590> something<00:05:16.070> may

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
cynicism that feels like something may

cynicism that feels like something may
be<00:05:16.460> off<00:05:16.730> of<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.970> most<00:05:17.210> recent<00:05:17.750> Queens<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.200> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
Stone Age record but that only works for

Stone Age record but that only works for
so<00:05:21.020> long<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.740> only<00:05:22.040> powers<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> little<00:05:23.120> bit<00:05:23.240> of

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
so long it only powers a little bit of

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.180 
so long it only powers a little bit of
instrumentation<00:05:24.020> things<00:05:24.680> slow<00:05:24.950> down<00:05:25.160> a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
instrumentation things slow down a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.520 
instrumentation things slow down a
little<00:05:25.490> bit<00:05:25.669> on<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.940> track<00:05:26.180> white<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.870> red<00:05:27.140> and

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
little bit on the track white is red and

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.740 
little bit on the track white is red and
it<00:05:28.130> tells<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.580> story<00:05:28.610> of<00:05:29.060> young<00:05:29.240> heartache

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
it tells the story of young heartache

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.000 
it tells the story of young heartache
sure<00:05:30.139> we've<00:05:30.350> heard<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.650> before

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
sure we've heard it before

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.640 
sure we've heard it before
but<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:32.000> welcome<00:05:32.540> sonic<00:05:33.020> change<00:05:33.350> in<00:05:33.560> the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
but it's a welcome sonic change in the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.070 
but it's a welcome sonic change in the
record<00:05:33.950> definitely<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.460> major<00:05:34.790> shift<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.570> sound

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
record definitely a major shift in sound

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.200 
record definitely a major shift in sound
but<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.710> somehow<00:05:36.979> doesn't<00:05:37.370> feel<00:05:37.700> out<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.000> place

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
but it somehow doesn't feel out of place

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.480 
but it somehow doesn't feel out of place
the<00:05:38.840> vocals<00:05:39.200> do<00:05:39.380> feel<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.650> little<00:05:39.860> bit<00:05:40.100> flat<00:05:40.460> and

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
the vocals do feel a little bit flat and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.000 
the vocals do feel a little bit flat and
obviously<00:05:41.180> more<00:05:41.479> restrained<00:05:42.020> here<00:05:42.350> but<00:05:42.860> the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
obviously more restrained here but the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.070 
obviously more restrained here but the
chorus<00:05:43.340> does<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.580> solid<00:05:43.880> job<00:05:44.390> of<00:05:44.630> delivering

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
chorus does a solid job of delivering

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.690 
chorus does a solid job of delivering
the<00:05:45.169> more<00:05:45.350> poignant<00:05:45.740> performance<00:05:46.550> that

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
the more poignant performance that

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.760 
the more poignant performance that
really<00:05:46.880> captures<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.419> listeners<00:05:47.930> ear<00:05:48.289> all<00:05:48.560> in
