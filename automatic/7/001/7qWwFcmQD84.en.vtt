from<00:02:25.360> from<00:02:25.690> Hatton<00:02:26.069> which<00:02:27.069> obviously

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
from from Hatton which obviously

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.120 
from from Hatton which obviously
ultimately<00:02:27.940> proved<00:02:28.239> inconsequential<00:02:28.959> but<00:02:29.200> it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
ultimately proved inconsequential but it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.070 
ultimately proved inconsequential but it
was<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.690> consistent<00:02:31.690> with<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.900> with<00:02:32.049> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
was just consistent with it with a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.039 
was just consistent with it with a
display<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.920> wasn't<00:02:33.100> home<00:02:34.049> which

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
display that really wasn't home which

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.470 
display that really wasn't home which
which<00:02:35.560> which<00:02:35.590> really<00:02:35.950> wasn't<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.760> that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
which which really wasn't that that's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.690 
which which really wasn't that that's
people<00:02:38.019> really<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.100> said<00:02:39.310> good<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.549> touch
