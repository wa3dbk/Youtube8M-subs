00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
can see just great proof so the problem

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.070 
can see just great proof so the problem
is<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.450> color<00:00:28.250> particularly<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.730> this

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
is in this color particularly in this

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
is in this color particularly in this
cheap<00:00:31.080> plastic<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.390> easily

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
cheap plastic bit that is easily

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
cheap plastic bit that is easily
scratched<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:35.030> reflects<00:00:36.030> light<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.610> usually

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
scratched and reflects light and usually

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
scratched and reflects light and usually
decreases<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> image<00:00:40.440> quality<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.870> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this one so the other method is to fix

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.989 
this one so the other method is to fix
it<00:01:10.950> yourself

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
it yourself

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.870 
it yourself
using<00:01:12.770> scratch<00:01:13.770> pixel<00:01:14.310> paste<00:01:14.609> or<00:01:15.270> even<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
using scratch pixel paste or even a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.819 
using scratch pixel paste or even a
simple<00:01:18.020> toothpaste<00:01:20.149> but<00:01:21.409> that<00:01:22.409> isn't

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
simple toothpaste but that isn't

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.429 
simple toothpaste but that isn't
effective<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:24.139> so<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.659> third<00:01:27.959> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
effective to so the first the third and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.609 
effective to so the first the third and
the<00:01:28.679> most<00:01:28.889> effective<00:01:29.549> method<00:01:30.209> is<00:01:30.469> just<00:01:31.469> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the most effective method is just to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.690 
the most effective method is just to
remove<00:01:32.249> this<00:01:33.079> plastic<00:01:34.340> scratch<00:01:35.340> protection

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
remove this plastic scratch protection

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
remove this plastic scratch protection
and<00:01:37.549> that<00:01:38.549> will<00:01:38.789> keep<00:01:38.999> the<00:01:39.439> great<00:01:40.439> image

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and that will keep the great image

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.019 
and that will keep the great image
quality<00:01:40.859> as<00:01:41.639> you<00:01:41.789> can<00:01:41.969> see<00:01:42.149> now<00:01:42.359> and<00:01:43.999> it<00:01:44.999> is

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
quality as you can see now and it is
