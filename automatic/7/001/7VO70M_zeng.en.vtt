there's<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> reason<00:02:03.689> why<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:03.990> are<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.009> top

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
there's a reason why these are the top

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.150 
there's a reason why these are the top
five<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.390> can't<00:02:06.600> disagree<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.140> fiddle<00:02:07.979> six

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.080 
five and I can't disagree and fiddle six
is<00:02:08.310> number<00:02:08.700> ten

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
is number ten

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.350

at fifty three percent which isn't too

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.699 
at fifty three percent which isn't too
bad<00:02:13.569> considering<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> top<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
bad considering that the top is

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.100 
bad considering that the top is
fifty-six<00:02:15.280> percent<00:02:15.459> but<00:02:16.360> he's<00:02:16.629> labeled<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:17.080> a

fifty-six percent but he's labeled as a

fifty-six percent but he's labeled as a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420

one more quintessence ruined to update

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.830 
one more quintessence ruined to update

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
to my my ruin page and then i'll be

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.589 
to my my ruin page and then i'll be

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
making a new physics guide so look out

making a new physics guide so look out
for<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.049> going<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.230> be<00:03:14.290> much<00:03:14.530> more

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
for that it's going to be much more
