like<00:06:19.270> split<00:06:19.690> ends<00:06:19.960> after<00:06:20.320> a<00:06:20.350> while<00:06:20.620> of

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
like split ends after a while of

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.790 
like split ends after a while of
basically<00:06:21.940> wear<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:22.510> tear<00:06:22.780> but<00:06:23.050> if<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.590> go<00:06:23.740> to

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
basically wear and tear but if you go to

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.290 
basically wear and tear but if you go to
like<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.400> know<00:06:24.430> especially<00:06:24.700> if<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.030> want

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
like you know especially if you want

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.790 
like you know especially if you want
because<00:06:25.450> I'm<00:06:25.630> not<00:06:25.900> sure<00:06:26.140> exactly<00:06:26.500> how<00:06:26.740> many

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
because I'm not sure exactly how many

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.460 
because I'm not sure exactly how many
lengths<00:06:27.400> they<00:06:27.550> have<00:06:27.820> I<00:06:28.180> think<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:29.080> shortest

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
lengths they have I think the shortest

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.860 
lengths they have I think the shortest
length<00:06:29.650> is<00:06:29.860> about<00:06:29.980> maybe<00:06:30.280> 16<00:06:30.910> or<00:06:30.940> 20<00:06:31.360> inches<00:06:31.690> so

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
length is about maybe 16 or 20 inches so

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.780 
length is about maybe 16 or 20 inches so
you<00:06:31.990> could<00:06:32.140> go<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.290> your<00:06:32.500> hair<00:06:32.710> salon<00:06:33.040> and<00:06:33.610> make

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
you could go to your hair salon and make

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.720 
you could go to your hair salon and make
them<00:06:34.030> layer<00:06:34.450> into<00:06:35.050> whatever<00:06:35.260> and<00:06:35.800> they<00:06:36.460> can

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
them layer into whatever and they can

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.730 
them layer into whatever and they can
really<00:06:37.090> fix<00:06:37.390> it<00:06:37.570> up<00:06:37.690> for<00:06:37.720> you<00:06:37.870> exactly<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.560> your
