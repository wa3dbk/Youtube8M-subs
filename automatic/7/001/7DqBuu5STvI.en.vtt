well music has a pattern of short and
long<00:00:13.110> tones<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:15.000> combination<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> these

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
long tones the combination of these

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.730 
long tones the combination of these
tones<00:00:16.230> written<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> notes<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.490> called<00:00:17.760> rhythm

tones written in notes is called rhythm
so<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.100> quarter<00:00:20.640> notes<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.630> have

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so we have quarter notes and we have

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
so we have quarter notes and we have
half<00:00:25.170> notes<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:27.650> quarter<00:00:28.650> notes<00:00:28.920> whenever<00:00:29.189> we

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
half notes and quarter notes whenever we

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.930 
half notes and quarter notes whenever we
see<00:00:29.609> those<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.359> quarter<00:00:31.669> whenever<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.820> see

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
see those we say quarter whenever we see

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
see those we say quarter whenever we see
the<00:00:33.059> half<00:00:33.270> note<00:00:33.590> we<00:00:34.590> say<00:00:34.860> half<00:00:35.520> note<00:00:36.860> okay

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the half note we say half note okay

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.220 
the half note we say half note okay
notes<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.210> divided<00:00:39.690> into<00:00:39.840> bar<00:00:40.320> lines<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
notes are divided into bar lines and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.130 
notes are divided into bar lines and
those<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.620> called<00:00:43.829> measures<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.239> bar<00:00:45.899> lines

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
those are called measures so bar lines

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.240 
those are called measures so bar lines
is<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> straight<00:00:46.860> vertical<00:00:47.160> lines<00:00:48.260> okay<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
is a straight vertical lines okay and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
is a straight vertical lines okay and
what's<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.300> those<00:00:51.719> bar<00:00:52.050> lines<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.590> called<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
what's in those bar lines is called the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.569 
what's in those bar lines is called the
measure<00:00:53.360> now<00:00:54.360> usually<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:55.160> these<00:00:56.160> quarter

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
measure now usually we see these quarter

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.860 
measure now usually we see these quarter
notes<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.969> half<00:00:57.149> notes<00:00:57.420> within<00:00:57.629> these

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
notes and half notes within these

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.810 
notes and half notes within these
measures<00:00:58.320> okay<00:00:59.780> now<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> end<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> song

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
measures okay now at the end of a song

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
measures okay now at the end of a song
we<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.300> call<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> double<00:01:03.930> bar<00:01:04.110> line

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
we see what we call it a double bar line

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
we see what we call it a double bar line
and<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.850> six<00:01:06.330> outline<00:01:07.700> preceded<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and it's one six outline preceded by a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.530 
and it's one six outline preceded by a
thin<00:01:09.600> line<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.820> tells<00:01:12.090> us<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> it's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
thin line and that tells us that it's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
thin line and that tells us that it's
the<00:01:12.659> end<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> song<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> our<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.380> song

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
quarter whenever we see a half note

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.060 
quarter whenever we see a half note
we're<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.820> say<00:02:24.940> half<00:02:25.209> note<00:02:25.920> notice<00:02:26.920> how

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
we're going to say half note notice how

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.690 
we're going to say half note notice how
each<00:02:27.280> measure<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.730> divided<00:02:28.390> by<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.570> bar<00:02:28.959> lines

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
each measure is divided by the bar lines

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770 
each measure is divided by the bar lines
and<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> end<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.300> piece<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.630> see

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and then at the end of the piece we see

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.310 
and then at the end of the piece we see
the<00:02:31.870> double<00:02:32.140> bar<00:02:32.290> line<00:02:32.790> okay<00:02:33.790> let's<00:02:34.030> let's<00:02:35.020> do

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
the double bar line okay let's let's do

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.840 
the double bar line okay let's let's do
the<00:02:35.470> practice<00:02:35.800> direction<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.340> says<00:02:36.520> clap
