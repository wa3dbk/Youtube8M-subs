00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 All txtr.com for the 80 and 2002 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:15.170
 there is the nystedt from dany cream 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 chocolate hare is exactly that's okay 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.840
 do not trust them because of to quality 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.840
 tradition 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.899
 Then cream is 78 and 16 to come like that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:55.010
 many ingredients such as gelatine 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 or lactic acid is that in this way 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:11.850
 is also sometimes called on blankets and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 animators sony even the cream tastes 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 already obvious to asia and now 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.860
 for demonstration purposes, I hope the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.860
 on the plate 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:50.320
 right now it's delicious or he is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.479
 would not like to eat that right now 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:02:00.900
 I wonder what that black one 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 point is that he irritated me 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:11.790
 me no hike 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.790
 what does say what is the kassel must 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
 no hard pieces comes 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 which do not annoy hard pieces 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.650
 I have to say a little bit probably 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 only so hears but is one 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.750
 typically I'm totally delicious too 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.150
 eat 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.610
 who is good for a different one ? 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.269
 duett the caramel you have something i have 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.099
 there is simply the concern in the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.760
 Search box album from a channel or on 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.380
 my homepage then I find that 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.450
 otherwise it was now with the result 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.450
 I 'm still doing a tight velvet version 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:41.840
 but this would have over time then 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:41.840
 had cooperated in the cooperation 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:44.210

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.210
