00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.700
 now we are going to plant potatoes 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.380
 the way when 15 years we checked it 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:17.410
 engaged I take from the heap a former straw 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.270
 once this land once she was 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.970
 mansion 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:28.199
 Vinci she already passed the land she is on others 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:36.089
 the beds existed like straw so here 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.679
 i take i take the earth to her 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.329
 to pour 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:44.649
 directly potato and at that 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.319
 while a neighbor plows the land with a walking tractor I 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.620
 it is overwhelmed with scrap and do not dig 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:53.440
 that is, came to the clean area poured 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.159
 there straw piled gave a week to her 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.769
 stand out 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.670
 she settled a little after that I went 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.449
 plant potatoes 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.850
 a week or two meeting is not worth straw 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.159
 autumn class we tried under the table and 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.370
 for a very long time the earth thaws better 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.860
 put spring spring she 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:20.100
 but in matching gloss and earth 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.100
 warm go to landing 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.240
 tomatoes 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.510
 Of course solanova stock lena you 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.470
 track solanaceous plant is not very 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.700
 do the right thing but with straw 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.740
 farming think that's enough 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.460
 let's say that i do i rake 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.000
 show close to the ground and then rake 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.020
 in the ground 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.570
 a small hole and this fishing pole into this 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.430
 I put potatoes in the hole 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:16.990
 time. top now i take the spade 2 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.090
 half the earth as do not mind covering 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.270
 on top of how much land you pull out 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 and 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.110
 up will depend on it two 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.020
 how fast the potatoes grow 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.620
 will break through so the less you impose 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.330
 faster it will rise but it will 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.400
 depend 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.310
 appetite in mice ie if you are good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 cover the ground then the mice becomes 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.280
 smaller i.e. loss of harvest in mice 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.290
 it turns out smaller that is when we 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.459
 We covered the weak 20 percent 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.459
 gave mouse tax land tax 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.269
 the battery is low 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:10.689
 everything stopped when we didn't cover 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.359
 Well, that is covered with a large layer 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.400
 Ie percent 10 mice gave but 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.430
 here the percentage will have to be anyway 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.090
 give back is a way to get rid of it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.359
 rely on 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.569
 most mod on wife example wife straw 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:35.280
 you have a mouse to live there will not be she rouge 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.280
 doesn't love her in rye in polises 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.280
 vodka planting potatoes 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.750
 now till autumn I will fit this bed 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.010
 just to talk to 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.200
 no need to water plants anymore 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.260
 spud will not water 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.930
 nothing if 120 doesn't bother anyone 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.500

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.299
