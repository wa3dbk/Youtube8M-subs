00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
Guardians have brought out what we call

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.069 
Guardians have brought out what we call
their<00:00:35.070> ghosts<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.510> gathered<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
their ghosts what we gathered from the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.319 
their ghosts what we gathered from the
e3<00:00:37.530> demo<00:00:37.559> earlier<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.489> year<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:38.969> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
e3 demo earlier this year is that this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
e3 demo earlier this year is that this
ghost<00:00:39.660> will<00:00:39.930> help<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> player<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.680> guiding

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
ghost will help the player by guiding

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
ghost will help the player by guiding
them<00:00:41.250> through<00:00:41.280> environments<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.270> possibly

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
them through environments and possibly

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
them through environments and possibly
even<00:00:42.870> aiding<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.530> during<00:00:43.770> combat<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.670> this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
even aiding them during combat from this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.580 
even aiding them during combat from this
we<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.030> most<00:00:45.329> likely<00:00:45.480> assume<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> ghost

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we can most likely assume that the ghost

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
we can most likely assume that the ghost
is<00:00:46.829> an<00:00:46.980> important<00:00:47.489> part<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.969> every<00:00:48.329> Guardians

arsenal<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.890> important<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> bring<00:00:50.610> out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
arsenal and it's important to bring out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
arsenal and it's important to bring out
your<00:00:50.879> ghost<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.420> entering<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.020> of
