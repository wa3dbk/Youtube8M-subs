00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.450
 yeah I almost want to say 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.320
 do you think you have 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 do the game you should have done 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 tonight because it's not a big 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 motivation to value encounter we do not have 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.520
 finally felt capacities we will say 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 finally here wants tonight to win this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.250
 meet 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 no, but I think it was 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.609
 still pretty closed match since the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.310
 not really had opportunities of both 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.210
 sides has no wake borrowing inhabitants 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 here we take a goal on kick 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.910
 stopped it was a yeah that was it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.129
 a closed match 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 we tried to give the maximum to the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.040
 hand there are unfortunately evenings that night 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.149
 not walk wen more damage because 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 some of them say you take 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 the goal we were not going and that's what 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.989
 moment it is you who do 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.850
 game and resume the game to our account 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.500
 that she is in a hurry the elected one denies nothing 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.870
 web and that's what we wanted to do but 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.399
 good they scored quickly after we 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 learn there we tried but here we go 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.020
 did not it work we are disappointed because 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 that it was the derby we wanted to keep 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.570
 it is 1 5020 sibility sorry but that's it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 we are disappointed it is in italy and you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 did not know how to get through tonight because 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.229
 is that really one of those moments 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 pass and that Saint-Etienne was going 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.860
 really take a step tonight you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.040
 think it's not crossed after it's 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.850
 games which is played not much 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 that could have turned into our 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 favor on a kick stopped for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.009
 we are the same 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.009
 this is his tour for them I thank 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.570
 my dream I hope will be happier you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.920
 because I really felt the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 great madness after this meeting 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.159
 lightning spent a lot and to see everything 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 that but we'll say it's still 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.130
 team logic made the game decided 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.640
 tonight wanting to win this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.210
 meet 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.790
 yes we have tried to 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 to defend high enough we did not do 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.220
 our best match clearly because 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.799
 that because I think there is also 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 the atmosphere of the derby there was had 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.040
 a pretty strong issue because it was 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.409
 two teams that were on the podium 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.570
 so here it was a bit complicated in 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.119
 second half we suffered but we 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.979
 never had bad intentions on 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.840
 always tried to play out 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 the ball is good even if we mark on 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.409
 kick stopped I think we have 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.850
 been rewarded it's a win a 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.259
 little narrow anyway still 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 of the guy were saying moment that you a 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.350
 change a certain moment to maybe 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.430
 makes the difference so I still 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.360
 title time did it all the same 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.620
 evening to go win this meeting 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.030
 and take risks at some 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.290
 moments because you also know that so much 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.300
 is that he may not be suffering and at 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 play me too that's exactly that I 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.190
 a team and a player player walks 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 with Michel on the left side would 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.970
 maybe a little more comfortable than yoann 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.580
 also who had given here we were a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.410
 little more balanced like that already won at 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.420
 10 against saint-etienne month after one has 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.010
 played ten to ten but hey it's a 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.900
 Derby 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.489
 Here we we won this time he 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.810
 there is a lot of joy that scares 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.069
 for the opponents I say because at 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.450
 home or almost never 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.590
 now we see marseille me the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.100
 match there you start to win at 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.390
 outdoors 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.660
 it is scary to others anyway 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.530
 yes, we will not ignite either 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.030
 not ignite either but here I am 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.739
 believe we're trying to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.290
 to print something not to suffer 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.730
 and for the moment it succeeds us but 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.579
 good the road is very long 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.530
 we will continue to recover well already 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.400
 because Wednesday we get nancy then 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.690
 Sunday at the park 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.860
 hold the cure for the way after 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.730
 what are you doing during the 48 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.730
 hours thanks to you
