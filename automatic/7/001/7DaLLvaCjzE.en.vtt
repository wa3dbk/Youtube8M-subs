00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
of scavenger on this class and it seems

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
of scavenger on this class and it seems
to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:39.930> really<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.590> ground<00:00:40.800> more

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to be really really good for ground more

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
to be really really good for ground more
you<00:00:41.489> guys<00:00:41.640> haven't<00:00:41.969> play<00:00:42.090> ground<00:00:42.360> war<00:00:42.450> yet<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you guys haven't play ground war yet it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
you guys haven't play ground war yet it
is<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:44.040> much<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.280> system<00:00:44.940> hack

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is it's pretty much just system hack

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.170 
is it's pretty much just system hack
after<00:00:45.390> system<00:00:45.690> hat<00:00:45.840> after<00:00:46.110> system<00:00:46.770> hacked<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
after system hat after system hacked and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.729 
after system hat after system hacked and
it<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.230> annoying<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it can get really really annoying so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
it can get really really annoying so
hard<00:00:50.070> water<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.820> fun<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> use<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
hard water is pretty fun to use but the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
hard water is pretty fun to use but the
only<00:00:52.170> downside<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:53.070> you're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
only downside of that if you're going to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.310 
only downside of that if you're going to
go<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.610> these<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:53.910> streaks<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.690> need<00:00:54.899> ammo

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
go on these long streaks you need ammo

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.680 
go on these long streaks you need ammo
you<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.860> scavenger<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.539> that's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you need scavenger and I think that's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
you need scavenger and I think that's
why<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.899> gun<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> pretty<00:00:58.559> damn<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:59.010> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
why this gun is pretty damn good in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
why this gun is pretty damn good in
ground<00:00:59.370> war<00:00:59.579> with<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> hardwired<00:01:00.719> perk<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
ground war with the hardwired perk and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.880 
ground war with the hardwired perk and
you<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.770> need<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.390> scavenger<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> just

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

that<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.970> don't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.360> rush<00:01:30.689> too<00:01:31.320> much<00:01:31.560> in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that I don't really rush too much in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
that I don't really rush too much in
this<00:01:31.799> game<00:01:32.009> play<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.460> mean<00:01:33.090> most<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> times

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this game play I mean most of the times

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
this game play I mean most of the times
you'll<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.380> pregaming<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.950> lot<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you'll see me just pregaming a lot and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
you'll see me just pregaming a lot and
that's<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> play<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.329> map<00:01:36.570> green<00:01:36.960> band<00:01:37.170> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that's how I play this map green band in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
that's how I play this map green band in
my<00:01:37.560> opinion<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> trickier<00:01:38.640> maps

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
my opinion is one of the trickier maps

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
my opinion is one of the trickier maps
the<00:01:39.810> spawns<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.530> erratic<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the spawns are really erratic and if you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
the spawns are really erratic and if you
don't<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> say<00:01:43.200> mid<00:01:43.409> map<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
don't if you kind of say mid map you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.380 
don't if you kind of say mid map you
don't<00:01:44.189> necessarily<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.270> they're

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
don't necessarily know where they're

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.330 
don't necessarily know where they're
going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> spawn<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.740> very<00:01:46.770> tricky<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
going to spawn at it's very tricky the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
going to spawn at it's very tricky the
spawns<00:01:47.579> flip<00:01:47.939> very<00:01:48.180> fast<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> do

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
spawns flip very fast what I like to do

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.260 
spawns flip very fast what I like to do
is<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> play<00:01:49.710> passive<00:01:50.220> saying<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
is I like to play passive saying up a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330 
is I like to play passive saying up a
power<00:01:51.600> point<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> map<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.770> can't<00:01:53.220> my

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
power point on the map and just can't my

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340 
power point on the map and just can't my
ass<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:55.020> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
i like to play now let's talk about

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
i like to play now let's talk about
another<00:02:00.270> map<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.229> use<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> campy

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
another map where you could use a campy

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.819 
another map where you could use a campy
/<00:02:02.399> rush<00:02:02.960> approach<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.290> would<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
/ rush approach and that would be like a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
/ rush approach and that would be like a
map<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.250> instinct<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.090> you're<00:02:06.689> spawning<00:02:06.960> at

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
map like instinct if you're spawning at

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
map like instinct if you're spawning at
the<00:02:07.259> sea<00:02:07.439> flag<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> want<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.489> if

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the sea flag what you want to do if

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.609 
the sea flag what you want to do if
you're<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> side<00:02:09.810> let's<00:02:10.259> talk<00:02:10.470> about

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you're at the a side let's talk about

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.960 
you're at the a side let's talk about
this<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> side<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> map

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
this if you're at the a side of the map

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.490 
this if you're at the a side of the map
what<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> want<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.110> you're<00:02:13.230> spending

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
what you want to do if you're spending

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.730 
what you want to do if you're spending
on<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
on the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.320 
on the
a side<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
a side is you just want to go to the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.520 
a side is you just want to go to the
middle<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.630> map<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.350> hold

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
middle of the map and you want to hold

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.130 
middle of the map and you want to hold
that<00:02:16.650> position<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.760> position<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.600> so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
that position that position is so so

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.530 
that position that position is so so
strong<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> seaside<00:02:20.280> map<00:02:20.580> over<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
strong on the seaside map over the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
strong on the seaside map over the
seaside<00:02:21.930> map<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.470> can<00:02:22.620> pick<00:02:22.740> off<00:02:22.920> kills

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
seaside map and you can pick off kills

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
seaside map and you can pick off kills
super<00:02:24.060> super<00:02:24.210> easily<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.050> then<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
super super easily and then it's a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.920 
super super easily and then it's a
really<00:02:26.190> big<00:02:26.430> strong<00:02:26.820> power<00:02:27.180> point<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> map

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
really big strong power point of the map

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.420 
really big strong power point of the map
and<00:02:28.170> most<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.800> times<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.100> lot<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> people

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and most of the times a lot of people

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.370 
and most of the times a lot of people
from<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> sea<00:02:30.450> spawn<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.990> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> try<00:02:31.320> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
from the sea spawn are going to try to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.840 
from the sea spawn are going to try to
take<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.950> away<00:02:32.070> from<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.670> really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
take that away from you and it's really

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.240 
take that away from you and it's really
just<00:02:32.940> easy<00:02:33.390> kills<00:02:33.780> easy<00:02:34.170> kills<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.740> easy<00:02:34.950> kills

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
just easy kills easy kills up easy kills

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.340 
just easy kills easy kills up easy kills
so<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.910> kind<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> play<00:02:36.690> pretty<00:02:36.930> campy

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
so you kind of want to play pretty campy

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.020 
so you kind of want to play pretty campy
but<00:02:37.530> now<00:02:38.010> let's<00:02:38.190> say<00:02:38.370> you're<00:02:38.520> spawning<00:02:38.820> at<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
but now let's say you're spawning at the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
but now let's say you're spawning at the
seaside<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.930> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.590> obviously

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
seaside what you want to do is obviously

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.920 
seaside what you want to do is obviously
you<00:02:41.310> want<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.580> rush<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.240> side<00:02:42.540> because

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
you want to rush on this side because

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.200 
you want to rush on this side because
you<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.350> map<00:02:43.530> control<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:44.940> get

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
you want to get map control so you get

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.370 
you want to get map control so you get
map<00:02:45.390> control<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.050> middle<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
map control you get the middle of the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.830 
map control you get the middle of the
map<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:47.790> after<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> do

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
map and then after that what you can do

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
map and then after that what you can do
if<00:02:49.200> they<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> flag<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.610> into

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
if they have the a flag you can go into

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.360 
if they have the a flag you can go into
that<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.300> flag<00:02:51.630> side<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.070> rush

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that a flag side and you can just rush

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.710 
that a flag side and you can just rush
in<00:02:53.550> there<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.820> kill<00:02:54.000> them<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.480> cave

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
in there and kill them out of that cave

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.870 
in there and kill them out of that cave
like<00:02:54.990> crazy<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> highly<00:02:56.280> suggest<00:02:56.520> trying

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
like crazy so I highly suggest trying

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.220 
like crazy so I highly suggest trying
that<00:02:57.090> strategy<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.870> you're<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that strategy out if you're on the a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.660 
that strategy out if you're on the a
side<00:02:58.500> plate<00:02:58.800> campy<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.370> you're<00:02:59.520> on<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
side plate campy if you're on the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.270 
side plate campy if you're on the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
certain maps you want to place a lot

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.700 
certain maps you want to place a lot
differently<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.020> you're<00:03:10.170> playing<00:03:10.380> really

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
differently if you're playing really

Russia on green band most like chances

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.760 
Russia on green band most like chances
are<00:03:12.960> you're<00:03:13.080> going<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> get<00:03:13.380> killed<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
back quite a bit these phones aren't

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.020 
back quite a bit these phones aren't
very<00:03:15.660> predictable<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.500> instinct<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
very predictable on instinct just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
very predictable on instinct just
sitting<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.780> probably<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> best<00:03:19.380> bet<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
sitting a is probably the best bet you

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.130 
sitting a is probably the best bet you
got<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.250> then<00:03:20.490> if<00:03:20.760> you're<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.840> you're<00:03:21.930> wanting

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
got and then if you're if you're wanting

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.410 
got and then if you're if you're wanting
see<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.070> cave<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.550> just<00:03:24.270> shit

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
see just go in that cave and just shit

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.420 
see just go in that cave and just shit
on<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.290> let's<00:03:25.830> talk<00:03:25.950> about<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.220> map

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
on them now like let's talk about a map

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.580 
on them now like let's talk about a map
by<00:03:26.580> come<00:03:26.880> back<00:03:27.060> or<00:03:27.270> create<00:03:27.660> our<00:03:27.840> comeback<00:03:28.410> or

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
by come back or create our comeback or

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.980 
by come back or create our comeback or
bio<00:03:28.830> lab<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.460> these<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.180> maps<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.900> go

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
bio lab on these two maps I like to go

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.140 
bio lab on these two maps I like to go
balls<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.620> wall<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.160> Russia<00:03:32.460> ton<00:03:32.880> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
balls to the wall in Russia ton and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.670 
balls to the wall in Russia ton and
they're<00:03:33.720> probably<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.050> best<00:03:34.260> mass<00:03:34.440> for

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
they're probably the best mass for

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
they're probably the best mass for
rushing<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.070> my<00:03:35.190> opinion<00:03:35.400> retreat<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.330> another

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
rushing in my opinion retreat is another

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.970 
rushing in my opinion retreat is another
one<00:03:36.990> of<00:03:37.020> those<00:03:37.110> mats<00:03:37.380> for<00:03:37.590> its<00:03:37.740> kind<00:03:37.920> of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
one of those mats for its kind of

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.860 
one of those mats for its kind of
situational<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.940> rush<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.360> can<00:03:39.570> camp

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
situational you can rush you can camp

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.580 
situational you can rush you can camp
but<00:03:40.830> overall<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.630> think<00:03:42.630> bio<00:03:42.990> lab<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.470> come

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
but overall I think bio lab and come

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.370 
but overall I think bio lab and come
back<00:03:43.710> are<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.040> best<00:03:44.310> maps<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:45.330> go<00:03:46.140> ham

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
back are the best maps to just go go ham

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.200 
back are the best maps to just go go ham
on<00:03:46.410> them<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.310> end<00:03:47.460> on<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.820> enemy<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.180> I

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
on them on the end on the enemy and I

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.790 
on them on the end on the enemy and I
have<00:03:48.360> some<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.690> good<00:03:48.840> game<00:03:49.020> place<00:03:49.260> Detroit

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
have some really good game place Detroit

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.020 
have some really good game place Detroit
to<00:03:49.920> another<00:03:50.100> map<00:03:50.310> where<00:03:50.520> you<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.700> go<00:03:50.790> balls

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
to another map where you can go balls

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.480 
to another map where you can go balls
deep<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:52.110> can<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.440> concern<00:03:52.740> situations<00:03:53.370> but

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
deep you can can concern situations but

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.460 
deep you can can concern situations but
overall<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.210> actually<00:03:54.900> those<00:03:55.080> three<00:03:55.290> maps

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
overall like actually those three maps

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.220 
overall like actually those three maps
Detroit<00:03:55.920> bio<00:03:56.280> lab<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.850> come<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.420> suggest

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
Detroit bio lab and come back I suggest

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.750 
Detroit bio lab and come back I suggest
is<00:03:58.380> running<00:03:58.680> around<00:03:58.830> like<00:03:58.950> them<00:03:59.070> back<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.640> I

DNA<00:04:01.320> bomb<00:04:01.500> too<00:04:01.710> much<00:04:01.890> because<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:02.580> do<00:04:02.820> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
DNA bomb too much because if you do that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.400 
DNA bomb too much because if you do that
what's<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.690> happen<00:04:04.020> is<00:04:04.110> you're<00:04:04.260> not
