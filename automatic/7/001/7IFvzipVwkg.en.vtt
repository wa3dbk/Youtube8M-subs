00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
so right now I am going to complete this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.190 
so right now I am going to complete this
transfer<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.370> fabric<00:00:09.290> like<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.440> see<00:00:10.650> here<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
transfer on fabric like you see here and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.680 
transfer on fabric like you see here and
on<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.620> little<00:00:14.009> pennant<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:15.000> put<00:00:15.299> some

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
on this little pennant I have put some

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.859 
on this little pennant I have put some
things<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.260> our<00:00:16.500> September<00:00:17.539> dreaming<00:00:18.539> kit

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
things from our September dreaming kit

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.429 
things from our September dreaming kit
and<00:00:19.310> I'm<00:00:20.310> testing<00:00:20.699> different<00:00:21.180> transfer<00:00:22.140> media

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and I'm testing different transfer media

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.480 
and I'm testing different transfer media
right<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.470> matte<00:00:26.189> medium

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
right now so this was with matte medium

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
right now so this was with matte medium
this<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.480> fabric<00:00:28.019> medium<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
this was with fabric medium and this one

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.069 
this was with fabric medium and this one
was<00:00:31.080> done<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:32.820> favorite<00:00:33.450> medium<00:00:33.840> which

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
was done with my favorite medium which

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.190 
was done with my favorite medium which
is<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.770> Mod<00:00:35.130> Podge<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:36.000> paper<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.660> think

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is actually Mod Podge for paper I think

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
is actually Mod Podge for paper I think
it<00:00:37.530> works<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> best<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.610> most<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it works the best out of most of the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
it works the best out of most of the
transfer<00:00:40.260> mediums<00:00:40.620> its<00:00:41.340> second<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.969> plain<00:00:42.390> old

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
transfer mediums its second to plain old

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.459 
transfer mediums its second to plain old
Elmer's<00:00:43.110> glue<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> just

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
Elmer's glue so this is one that I just

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.250 
Elmer's glue so this is one that I just
did<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.129> still<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.550> wet<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.719> did

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
did so it's still a little wet and I did

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
did so it's still a little wet and I did
this<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.649> recently<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> one

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
this one recently I'm gonna do this one

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
this one recently I'm gonna do this one
right<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.350> easy<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
right now just to show you how easy it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.930 
right now just to show you how easy it
is<00:00:52.860> using<00:00:53.850> magic<00:00:54.239> transfer<00:00:54.930> paper<00:00:55.170> which<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
is using magic transfer paper which is a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
is using magic transfer paper which is a
cellulose<00:00:56.940> fiber<00:00:57.360> paper<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.020> dissolves<00:00:58.590> way

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cellulose fiber paper that dissolves way

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.310 
cellulose fiber paper that dissolves way
more<00:00:59.489> easily<00:00:59.879> than<00:01:00.120> any<00:01:00.390> other<00:01:00.600> transfer

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
more easily than any other transfer

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.660 
more easily than any other transfer
method<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> paper<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
method in paper so I'm just using a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.570 
method in paper so I'm just using a
moderately<00:01:05.670> stiff<00:01:06.090> brush<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
moderately stiff brush this is a this is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.660 
moderately stiff brush this is a this is
actually<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.030> Martha<00:01:09.510> Stewart<00:01:09.979> I'll<00:01:10.979> show<00:01:11.220> ya

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually a Martha Stewart I'll show ya

actually a Martha Stewart I'll show ya
a<00:01:11.840> Martha<00:01:12.840> Stewart<00:01:13.229> brand<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.770> came<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a Martha Stewart brand that came like in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.420 
a Martha Stewart brand that came like in
a<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.670> 3-pack<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.740> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> brush

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
a little 3-pack and I'm going to brush

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.830 
a little 3-pack and I'm going to brush
some<00:01:18.979> plain<00:01:19.979> old<00:01:20.159> water<00:01:20.369> onto<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.420> back<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
some plain old water onto the back of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
some plain old water onto the back of
the<00:01:22.080> paper<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.680> transferred<00:01:23.280> onto<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the paper that's transferred onto the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.200 
the paper that's transferred onto the
fabric<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.229> raw<00:01:25.470> canvas

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
fabric which is just a raw canvas

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
fabric which is just a raw canvas
pennant<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:28.080> Hobby<00:01:28.380> Lobby<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:30.740> as

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pennant that I got at Hobby Lobby and as

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.200 
pennant that I got at Hobby Lobby and as
the<00:01:32.520> paper<00:01:32.759> gets<00:01:33.060> wet<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> saturated<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the paper gets wet and saturated the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.420 
the paper gets wet and saturated the
cellulose<00:01:36.780> fiber<00:01:37.229> starts<00:01:37.770> breaking<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.869> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
cellulose fiber starts breaking down and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.539 
cellulose fiber starts breaking down and
you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.259> mush<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.920> hand<00:01:44.189> along

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you can see if I just mush my hand along

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.190 
you can see if I just mush my hand along
it<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.939> coming<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.570> off<00:01:46.549> that's<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
it it's coming right off that's the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
it it's coming right off that's the
that's<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> fibers<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that's the fibers right there that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
that's the fibers right there that
usually<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> spend<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
usually you would have to spend like a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
usually you would have to spend like a
long<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:56.390> trying<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> paper<00:01:58.680> off

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
long time trying to get the paper off

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.840 
long time trying to get the paper off
the<00:01:58.979> back<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.430> your<00:01:59.670> image

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.860 

so<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.400> pretty<00:02:06.760> much<00:02:07.030> done<00:02:07.390> in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
so there it is it's pretty much done in

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.250 
so there it is it's pretty much done in
like<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.440> few<00:02:08.920> seconds<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.790> know<00:02:10.750> because<00:02:11.020> I've

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
like a few seconds I know because I've

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.300 
like a few seconds I know because I've
tried<00:02:11.440> doing<00:02:11.710> image<00:02:12.100> transfers<00:02:12.700> before<00:02:13.240> with

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
tried doing image transfers before with

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.060 
tried doing image transfers before with
regular<00:02:15.310> paper<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.330> takes<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.830> takes

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
regular paper and it takes like it takes

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.580 
regular paper and it takes like it takes
an<00:02:18.280> impossible<00:02:19.000> amount<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.690> time<00:02:19.930> sitting

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
an impossible amount of time sitting

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
an impossible amount of time sitting
there<00:02:20.740> trying<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> peel<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.850> back<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.210> the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
there trying to peel the back of the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.620 
there trying to peel the back of the
paper<00:02:22.480> off<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.260> image<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.730> magic<00:02:25.210> transfer

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
paper off of the image so magic transfer

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.890 
paper off of the image so magic transfer
paper<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.400> easy<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.360> just

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
paper is really easy to use you just

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.630 
paper is really easy to use you just
have<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.200> print<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> with<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> laser<00:02:30.100> printer

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
have to print it with a laser printer

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.200 
have to print it with a laser printer
because<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.670> paper<00:02:33.880> is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
because as you can see the paper is

the<00:02:44.410> paper<00:02:44.590> using<00:02:45.720> liquid<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.800> try<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.910 
the paper using liquid so if you try to
put<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.610> an<00:02:48.730> inkjet<00:02:48.970> printer<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.690> will

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
put this in an inkjet printer you will

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.740 
put this in an inkjet printer you will
completely<00:02:50.920> gum<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.730> whole<00:02:51.910> interior<00:02:52.390> of

completely gum up the whole interior of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.180 
completely gum up the whole interior of
the<00:02:52.870> printer<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.410> make<00:02:53.590> sure<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.860> don't<00:02:54.010> make

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190

that<00:02:54.220> mistake<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:55.480> has<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.840> go<00:02:55.960> in<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.170> laser

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
that mistake it has to go in a laser

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.520 
that mistake it has to go in a laser
printer<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:58.120> there<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.510> look<00:02:59.050> at<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.320> how
