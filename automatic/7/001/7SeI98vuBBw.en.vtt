basically the UNSC hasn't had contact

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.200 
basically the UNSC hasn't had contact
with<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:00.800> particular<00:05:01.010> base<00:05:01.520> for<00:05:01.820> almost<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
with this particular base for almost a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.510 
with this particular base for almost a
year<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:03.320> first<00:05:03.560> few<00:05:03.770> months<00:05:03.920> they<00:05:04.280> just

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
year for the first few months they just

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.340 
year for the first few months they just
assumed<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.150> was<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.300> communications<00:05:06.110> failure

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
assumed it was a communications failure

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.650 
assumed it was a communications failure
but<00:05:07.100> after<00:05:07.430> three<00:05:07.670> months<00:05:07.850> things<00:05:08.330> weren't

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
but after three months things weren't

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.159 
but after three months things weren't
fixed<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:10.040> they<00:05:10.220> sent<00:05:10.520> an<00:05:10.700> ODST<00:05:11.240> out<00:05:11.690> here<00:05:11.990> to

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
fixed so they sent an ODST out here to

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.200 
fixed so they sent an ODST out here to
see<00:05:12.380> what<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.680> problem<00:05:12.860> was<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.490> course<00:05:13.940> as
