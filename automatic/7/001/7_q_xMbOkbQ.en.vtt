00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.700 

this<00:00:05.640> step<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.660> fishing<00:00:07.080> current

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
this step is about the fishing current

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.990 
this step is about the fishing current
and<00:00:08.059> quite<00:00:09.059> honestly<00:00:10.370> fishing<00:00:11.370> current<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
and quite honestly fishing current is a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.709 
and quite honestly fishing current is a
whole<00:00:12.780> world<00:00:13.049> by<00:00:13.380> itself<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.219> 12<00:00:14.940> steps

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
whole world by itself it's it's 12 steps

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.890 
whole world by itself it's it's 12 steps
all<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.230> itself<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:16.949> because<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.900> fishing

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
all by itself because because a fishing

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
all by itself because because a fishing
current<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.560> fishing<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.100> correctly<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
current and fishing it correctly is a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
current and fishing it correctly is a
difficult<00:00:22.619> thing<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> something<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
difficult thing to do and something you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.230 
difficult thing to do and something you
have<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.670> work<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
have to you know you have to work at it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
have to you know you have to work at it
you<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> work<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you have to work at this this is a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.730 
you have to work at this this is a
another<00:00:29.670> situation<00:00:30.029> where<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.050> cannot

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
another situation where you just cannot

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
another situation where you just cannot
come<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> water's<00:00:33.510> edge<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
come up to the to the water's edge and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.569 
come up to the to the water's edge and
start<00:00:34.350> whaling<00:00:34.950> away

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
start whaling away

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.420 
start whaling away
you<00:00:35.969> need<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> stand<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you need to stand here if it were me and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819 
you need to stand here if it were me and
of<00:00:39.270> course<00:00:39.450> I've<00:00:39.600> seen<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.079> before<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.559> kind

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of course I've seen this before I kind

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
of course I've seen this before I kind
of<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> lay<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> land

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
of know how know the lay of the land

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
of know how know the lay of the land
here<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.399> new<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.210> would

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
here but if this was new to me I would

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
here but if this was new to me I would
walk<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.079> maybe<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.070> even<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.940> rod<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
walk up maybe not even have my rod and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
walk up maybe not even have my rod and
reel<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.870> me<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:49.890> walk<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> I'd

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
reel with me but I would walk up and I'd

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
reel with me but I would walk up and I'd
look<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> currents<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> I'd<00:00:52.800> watch<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
look at the currents and I'd watch and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
look at the currents and I'd watch and
look<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
look at it it's got a little bit of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
look at it it's got a little bit of
grass<00:00:55.500> over<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:55.980> occurred<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.020> know

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
grass over there occurred so you know

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.520 
grass over there occurred so you know
and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.449> number<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:01.039> don't<00:01:02.039> cast<00:01:02.460> upstream

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and I number one don't cast upstream

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
and I number one don't cast upstream
every<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.100> that'll<00:01:05.519> work<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.330> most

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
every now and then that'll work but most

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.620 
every now and then that'll work but most
of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:08.369> want<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
of the time I don't want I want you to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.149 
of the time I don't want I want you to
use<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> curve<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.939> if<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.180> throw<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> upstream

use the curve and if I throw it upstream

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.289 
use the curve and if I throw it upstream

to work the correct way in the fish most

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.920 
to work the correct way in the fish most
of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> time<00:01:22.430> they're<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> be

of the time they're not going to be
exactly<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> middle<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.799> current

it and that's what I'm looking for is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.899 
it and that's what I'm looking for is
the<00:01:33.930> edge<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> current<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.490> looking

the edge of the current and I'm looking

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260 
the edge of the current and I'm looking

two currents hit each other they always

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100 
two currents hit each other they always
farm<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.290> eddy<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.770> my<00:01:44.220> cast<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.079> okay<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
farm an eddy in my cast you know okay I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
farm an eddy in my cast you know okay I
don't<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.070> where<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> cast<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:48.270> never

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
don't know where to cast here I've never

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
don't know where to cast here I've never
fished<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.049> before<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.490> checked

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
fished here before but I have checked

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.960 
fished here before but I have checked
the<00:01:50.939> currents<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.049> Mike<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.340> first<00:01:53.670> cast

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the currents out so Mike my first cast

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
the currents out so Mike my first cast
would<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.659> across<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.049> current<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
would be right across that current and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
would be right across that current and
I'm<00:01:56.520> trying<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> swing<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.509> past<00:01:58.579> pass<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I'm trying to swing this past pass this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'm trying to swing this past pass this
grass<00:02:00.270> right<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.409> where

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
grass right over here that's where

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
grass right over here that's where
that's<00:02:02.100> where<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.790> bass<00:02:03.060> ought<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.509> be
