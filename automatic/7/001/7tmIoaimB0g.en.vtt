symbol<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> front<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.989> shows

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
symbol there in the front and it shows

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
symbol there in the front and it shows
like<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> streaking<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.430> there

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like a little bit of streaking in there

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
like a little bit of streaking in there
so<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> doesn't<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.359> nice<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
little transformer here he is next to my

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
little transformer here he is next to my
son's<00:01:27.290> like<00:01:28.290> matchbox<00:01:28.920> car<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.549> our<00:01:29.759> little

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
son's like matchbox car like our little

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
son's like matchbox car like our little
rpm<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:31.110> came<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.530> his<00:01:31.710> bumblebee

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
rpm that came with his bumblebee

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
rpm that came with his bumblebee
racetrack<00:01:32.880> set<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.320> grabbed<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.920> show

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
racetrack set so I grabbed that to show

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.870 
racetrack set so I grabbed that to show
quick<00:01:35.340> comparison<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.990> see

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
quick comparison and as you can see

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.460 
quick comparison and as you can see
these<00:01:38.880> are<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> leaves<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> class<00:01:39.720> bumblebees

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
these are the leaves in class bumblebees

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
these are the leaves in class bumblebees
they're<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.040> same<00:01:41.250> size<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.970> your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
they're about the same size as your

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
they're about the same size as your
typical<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.600> matchbox<00:01:43.170> car<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.310> just

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
typical little matchbox car so you just

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
typical little matchbox car so you just
look<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> yeah<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
look at like that yeah pretty much the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
look at like that yeah pretty much the
same<00:01:49.590> size<00:01:49.860> except<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.000> plastic<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
same size except this is plastic this is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
same size except this is plastic this is
metal<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.979> far<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.280> comparison<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.909> thought

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
metal but as far as comparison I thought

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.810 
metal but as far as comparison I thought
this<00:01:54.240> would<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.990> best

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.200 

so<00:01:58.420> there<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.630> go<00:01:58.860> let's<00:01:59.860> transform<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.490> really

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
so there you go let's transform a really

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.690 
so there you go let's transform a really
quick<00:02:01.450> very<00:02:02.440> simple<00:02:02.830> stuff<00:02:03.070> here<00:02:03.310> pull<00:02:03.640> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
quick very simple stuff here pull the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.630 
quick very simple stuff here pull the
legs<00:02:03.910> out<00:02:05.010> make<00:02:06.010> sure<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.280> get<00:02:06.430> them<00:02:06.550> all

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
legs out make sure you get them all

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.440 
legs out make sure you get them all
pulled<00:02:06.940> out<00:02:07.120> correctly<00:02:08.429> pull<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.550> arms<00:02:09.850> out

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.560 

stick<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.630> flip<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.920> chest<00:02:15.760> down<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.420> there

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
stick that flip the chest down and there

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.420
