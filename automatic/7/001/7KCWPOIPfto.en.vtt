00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470 
Jarrod's come let's go we've got hoses

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.950 
Jarrod's come let's go we've got hoses
coming<00:00:08.740> in<00:00:08.830> Bonner<00:00:09.300> Springs<00:00:10.300> of<00:00:10.570> water<00:00:10.599> around

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
coming in Bonner Springs of water around

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.919 
coming in Bonner Springs of water around
it's<00:00:11.589> good<00:00:11.830> yeah<00:00:12.040> here<00:00:12.309> we<00:00:12.969> are<00:00:13.030> here<00:00:13.299> and<00:00:13.780> we

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
it's good yeah here we are here and we

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's good yeah here we are here and we
can<00:00:14.110> kids<00:00:14.559> work<00:00:14.799> with<00:00:15.009> a<00:00:15.040> low<00:00:15.219> pressure<00:00:15.429> line

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
can kids work with a low pressure line

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.670 
can kids work with a low pressure line
so<00:00:16.780> these<00:00:16.900> are<00:00:17.020> really<00:00:17.110> good<00:00:17.289> for<00:00:17.440> car

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
so these are really good for car

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.730 
so these are really good for car
accidents<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.990> first<00:00:19.990> response<00:00:20.439> to<00:00:20.560> first

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
accidents and first response to first

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.710 
accidents and first response to first
attack<00:00:21.039> in<00:00:21.189> a<00:00:21.250> house<00:00:21.400> fire<00:00:21.640> or<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.090> grass<00:00:22.420> fire

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
attack in a house fire or a grass fire

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.610 
attack in a house fire or a grass fire
if<00:00:23.679> things<00:00:23.949> going<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.220> be<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.340> bigger<00:00:24.550> force

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:48.349 

these<00:00:31.520> places

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:01:40.850 

like<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:48.930> points<00:00:49.289> too<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:49.800> there

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.830 

so<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.550> can't<00:01:41.759> rock<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.330> take<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.690> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so we can't rock out when we take it to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
so we can't rock out when we take it to
work<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> beat<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:44.130> additional<00:01:44.550> attack

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
work with the beat or additional attack

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.919 
work with the beat or additional attack
before<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> drive<00:01:48.319> that<00:01:49.319> would<00:01:49.530> last<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
before the drive that would last the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.999 
before the drive that would last the
next<00:01:52.159> two<00:01:53.159> hoses<00:01:53.429> at<00:01:54.270> seven<00:01:54.630> minutes<00:01:55.009> there

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
next two hoses at seven minutes there

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.030 
next two hoses at seven minutes there
was<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> 64

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.270 

so<00:02:01.310> plastic<00:02:01.820> get<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.480> work<00:02:04.480> slowly<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:07.010> kids

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
so plastic get to work slowly the kids

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100 
so plastic get to work slowly the kids
will<00:02:07.490> be<00:02:07.520> better<00:02:07.729> what<00:02:07.970> do<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.090> got<00:02:08.360> take<00:02:08.960> it

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
will be better what do you got take it

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.400 
will be better what do you got take it
easy

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
easy

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:21.550 
easy
then<00:02:10.039> once<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.310> know<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:20.560> probably

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
then once you know that you probably

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:44.010 
then once you know that you probably
wash<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.190> cars<00:02:22.430> with<00:02:39.730> seven<00:02:40.730> shapes

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:03:18.050 

breaking<00:02:45.020> each<00:02:45.200> other

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.830 

this<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.629> pet<00:03:19.959> recruitment<00:03:20.409> thing<00:03:21.689> we<00:03:22.689> do

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
this little pet recruitment thing we do

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.020 
this little pet recruitment thing we do
think<00:03:23.109> will<00:03:23.260> be<00:03:23.500> P<00:03:23.709> V<00:03:24.099> positive<00:03:24.549> pressure

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
think will be P V positive pressure

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.240 
think will be P V positive pressure
ventilation<00:03:25.719> so<00:03:26.290> we<00:03:26.439> have<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> classifier

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
ventilation so we have a classifier

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.490 
ventilation so we have a classifier
that's<00:03:27.670> full<00:03:27.909> of<00:03:27.939> smoking<00:03:28.599> pretty<00:03:29.109> much<00:03:29.349> with

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's full of smoking pretty much with

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.699 
that's full of smoking pretty much with
debris<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:31.150> makes<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.510> hard<00:03:31.719> for<00:03:31.810> victims

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
debris and it makes it hard for victims

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.709 
debris and it makes it hard for victims
but<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.010> also<00:03:33.189> makes<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.669> hard<00:03:33.849> for<00:03:33.939> us<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.419> see

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
but it also makes it hard for us to see

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.470 
but it also makes it hard for us to see
where<00:03:35.499> we<00:03:35.650> going<00:03:35.980> what<00:03:36.129> we<00:03:36.310> doing<00:03:36.639> plus<00:03:36.909> all

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
where we going what we doing plus all

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.940 
where we going what we doing plus all
the<00:03:37.750> smoke<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.799> actually<00:03:38.950> unburned<00:03:40.950> volatile

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the smoke is actually unburned volatile

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.009 
the smoke is actually unburned volatile
gases<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.409> given<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.530> right<00:03:44.709> thing<00:03:45.069> fuel

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
gases so given the right thing fuel

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.440 
gases so given the right thing fuel
mixture<00:03:47.019> all<00:03:47.349> that<00:03:47.530> smart

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.309 

the<00:03:50.780> front<00:03:51.440> door<00:03:52.630> door<00:03:53.630> somewhere<00:03:53.990> else<00:03:54.170> we

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
the front door door somewhere else we

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.130 
the front door door somewhere else we
shed<00:03:55.099> all<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.400> smoke<00:03:55.760> making<00:03:56.720> twice<00:03:56.900> in

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
shed all that smoke making twice in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.680 
shed all that smoke making twice in
three<00:03:57.290> words<00:03:57.680> make<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:58.430> cool<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:59.150> get<00:03:59.510> some

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
three words make it be cool to get some

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.280 
three words make it be cool to get some
fresh<00:03:59.930> air<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.349> pig<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:05.200> between<00:04:06.200> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
fresh air to a pig just between a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.000 
fresh air to a pig just between a
hundred<00:04:06.470> ago<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.590> was<00:04:09.830> both

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010
