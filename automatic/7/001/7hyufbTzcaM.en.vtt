00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
feel that the twisted version is a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
feel that the twisted version is a
little<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.550> harder<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> wanted<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> give

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
little bit harder but I wanted to give

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.170 
little bit harder but I wanted to give
you<00:00:25.439> both<00:00:25.619> options<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.760> decide<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you both options so you can decide for

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
you both options so you can decide for
yourself<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.810> I've<00:00:28.050> said<00:00:28.349> many<00:00:28.410> times<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.369> feel

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
yourself as I've said many times I feel

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.030

and<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.740> piece<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.070> wire<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and that little piece of wire put the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
and that little piece of wire put the
Dalek<00:01:45.329> flute<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:45.750> push<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.350> little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
Dalek flute and then push the little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
Dalek flute and then push the little
wooden<00:01:46.799> bead<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.390> nice<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:48.899> snug<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
wooden bead up so it's nice and snug and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
wooden bead up so it's nice and snug and
what<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> glue<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:51.540> help

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
what this will do is the glue will help

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
what this will do is the glue will help
hold<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.380> wooden<00:01:52.829> bead<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.189> place<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.670> doesn't

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
hold the wooden bead in place or doesn't

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
hold the wooden bead in place or doesn't
slide<00:01:54.119> around<00:01:54.619> okay<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.280> I've

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
slide around okay now you can see I've

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
slide around okay now you can see I've
got<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> big<00:01:57.119> loop<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.689> thread<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.079> we're

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
got this big loop of thread here we're

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
got this big loop of thread here we're
actually<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.250> cut<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> loop<00:01:59.820> we

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
actually not going to cut that loop we

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
actually not going to cut that loop we
will<00:02:00.509> cut<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:01.110> struggling<00:02:01.860> piece<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
will cut this little struggling piece of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.490 
will cut this little struggling piece of
thread<00:02:02.790> off<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.420> set<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.840> aside<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.380> be

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
thread off just set that aside we'll be

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.999 
thread off just set that aside we'll be
using<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> later<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.500> tutorial

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
using it later and in this tutorial

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.309 
using it later and in this tutorial
you'll<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.610> doing<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> smoothing<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
you'll be doing a lot of smoothing of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.650 
you'll be doing a lot of smoothing of
the<00:02:10.470> thread<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.280> decide<00:02:11.640> which<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> front

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the thread so decide which is the front

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.930 
the thread so decide which is the front
and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.050> will<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.349> working<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.980> from<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.610> left

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and I will be working on from the left

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.600 
and I will be working on from the left
to<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.989> doll<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.370> first

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to the right on my doll so the first

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.119 
to the right on my doll so the first
step<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.690> smooth<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.410> side<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.950> left

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
step is to smooth the side on the left

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.040 
step is to smooth the side on the left
and<00:02:20.520> we're<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.910> be<00:02:21.150> gluing<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and we're going to be gluing down the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.710 
and we're going to be gluing down the
side<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> start<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.060> smooth<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> down

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
side of it so I start to smooth it down

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.910 
side of it so I start to smooth it down
kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.319> place<00:02:25.530> where<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.770> want<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
kind of place where I want it to be and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.979 
kind of place where I want it to be and
I'm<00:02:29.459> working<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.209> back<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:30.810> doll

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
I'm working with the back of my doll

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.460 
I'm working with the back of my doll
right<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:32.069> she's<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.660> front<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> facing

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
right now so she's the front is facing

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.509 
right now so she's the front is facing
down<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:35.760> she's<00:02:36.510> facing<00:02:36.660> front<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.519> you

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
down and now she's facing front and you

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.339 
down and now she's facing front and you
can<00:02:38.550> see<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.330> smoothing<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.140> hair

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
can see I'm just smoothing that hair

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.170 
can see I'm just smoothing that hair
down<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:41.010> added<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.430> little<00:02:41.790> doubt<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
down and I just added a little doubt of

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
down and I just added a little doubt of
glue<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.660> hold<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.410> into<00:02:43.590> place<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.610> I'm

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
glue to hold that into place and I'm

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.780 
glue to hold that into place and I'm
flipping<00:02:45.180> her<00:02:45.599> face<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:46.200> again<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.830> we're

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
flipping her face down again and we're

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.850 
flipping her face down again and we're
going<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.510> taking<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.959> left<00:02:49.230> side<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
going to be taking that left side of the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.490 
going to be taking that left side of the
hair<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.330> looping<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.050> way<00:02:52.170> around

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
hair and looping it all the way around

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.860 
hair and looping it all the way around
to<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.860> right<00:02:53.010> side<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.670> work<00:02:54.090> slowly<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to the right side so work slowly with

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530 
to the right side so work slowly with
small<00:02:55.170> dabs<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.590> glue<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.129> smooth<00:02:57.060> as<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.360> go

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
small dabs of glue and smooth as you go

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.320 
small dabs of glue and smooth as you go
and<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.739> will<00:02:59.220> add<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> little<00:02:59.790> dub<00:03:00.000> glue

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and I just will add a little dub glue

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.399 
and I just will add a little dub glue
and<00:03:00.629> then<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.650> gently<00:03:02.519> press<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:04.080> thread

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
and then I will gently press the thread

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.180 
and then I will gently press the thread
into<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.860> glue<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.069> we're

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
into the glue and so you can see we're

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.040 
into the glue and so you can see we're
going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.640> looping<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.120> all<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.720> way<00:03:09.840> up

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
going to be looping it all the way up

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.540 
going to be looping it all the way up
and<00:03:10.230> around<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.560> we've<00:03:10.769> taken<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.190> site<00:03:11.400> on

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
and around so we've taken the site on

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.940 
and around so we've taken the site on
the<00:03:11.700> left<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:12.420> we're<00:03:12.870> looping<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.319> up<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the left and we're looping it up and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.900 
the left and we're looping it up and
around

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
around

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.210 
around
and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.480> once<00:03:15.660> again<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.740> get<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and then once again just to get it to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.670 
and then once again just to get it to
hold<00:03:17.550> into<00:03:17.730> place<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.360> work<00:03:18.960> in<00:03:19.080> small<00:03:19.410> sections

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
hold into place I work in small sections

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.310 
hold into place I work in small sections
glue<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> little<00:03:20.760> bit<00:03:20.940> gently<00:03:21.870> press<00:03:22.110> the

thread<00:03:22.590> down<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.600> smooth<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.750> down<00:03:24.960> and<00:03:25.860> then

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
thread down and smooth it down and then

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.620 
thread down and smooth it down and then
we've<00:03:26.160> gotten<00:03:26.520> all<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.970> way<00:03:27.090> back<00:03:27.270> up<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.880 
we've gotten all the way back up to the
top<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.370> creates<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.060> nice

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
top so you can see this creates a nice

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.520 
top so you can see this creates a nice
smooth<00:03:31.890> paste<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:34.110> our<00:03:34.200> twisted<00:03:34.590> hairstyle

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
smooth paste for our twisted hairstyle

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.320 
smooth paste for our twisted hairstyle
so<00:03:37.530> we've<00:03:37.710> simply<00:03:38.100> taken<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.610> piece<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
so we've simply taken the piece on the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.730 
so we've simply taken the piece on the
left<00:03:39.990> and<00:03:40.530> looped<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.370> up<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.910> around<00:03:42.120> just

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
left and looped it up and around just

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.860 
left and looped it up and around just
gently<00:03:43.740> tacking<00:03:44.370> into<00:03:44.640> place<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.720> back

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
gently tacking into place in the back

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.350 
gently tacking into place in the back
with<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.560> glue<00:03:46.740> okay<00:03:47.700> once<00:03:47.940> we've<00:03:48.150> reached

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
with the glue okay once we've reached

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.430 
with the glue okay once we've reached
the<00:03:48.660> top<00:03:48.900> again

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the top again

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.770 
the top again
we're<00:03:49.860> going<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.280> start<00:03:50.550> gently<00:03:50.880> twisting<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
we're going to start gently twisting the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.540 
we're going to start gently twisting the
hair<00:03:51.990> so<00:03:52.230> here<00:03:52.410> she<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.890> front<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.430> you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
hair so here she is in the front and you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.130 
hair so here she is in the front and you
can<00:03:53.580> see<00:03:53.730> we've<00:03:54.060> we<00:03:54.480> haven't<00:03:54.780> even<00:03:54.840> touched

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
can see we've we haven't even touched

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.380 
can see we've we haven't even touched
the<00:03:55.410> side<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:56.370> we've<00:03:57.000> left<00:03:57.270> that

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
the side on the right we've left that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.730 
the side on the right we've left that
alone<00:03:57.720> we've<00:03:57.870> only<00:03:58.050> been<00:03:58.260> working<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
alone we've only been working with the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.040 
alone we've only been working with the
side<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> left<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.640> now<00:04:00.480> we're<00:04:00.660> going<00:04:00.840> to

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
side on the left and now we're going to

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.730 
side on the left and now we're going to
take<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.900> before<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> start<00:04:04.260> twisting<00:04:04.620> it

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
take it and before I start twisting it

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.260 
take it and before I start twisting it
too<00:04:04.860> much<00:04:04.980> I'm<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.250> going<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.730> take<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> little

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
too much I'm just going to take a little

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.540 
too much I'm just going to take a little
piece<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:07.020> kind<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.380> glue<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.680> down<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
piece and kind of glue it down on the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.610 
piece and kind of glue it down on the
side<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.500> flatten<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:10.980> down<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> little<00:04:11.430> bit<00:04:11.670> and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
side so flatten it down a little bit and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.470 
side so flatten it down a little bit and
then<00:04:13.620> gently<00:04:14.250> twist<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:17.150> once<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.299> have

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
then gently twist it and once you have

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.560 
then gently twist it and once you have
it<00:04:18.570> twisted<00:04:19.020> add<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.260> little<00:04:19.799> dab<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.190> glue<00:04:21.080> and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
it twisted add a little dab of glue and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.560 
it twisted add a little dab of glue and
same<00:04:24.570> method<00:04:25.080> just<00:04:25.380> working<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.180> little

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
same method just working with a little

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.390 
same method just working with a little
bit<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> thread<00:04:28.200> at<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.500> time<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.070> small

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
bit of the thread at a time and small

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.880 
bit of the thread at a time and small
sections<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.900> I've<00:04:31.020> twisted<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.560> first

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
sections so I've twisted that first

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.580 
sections so I've twisted that first
little<00:04:32.190> part<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.460> her<00:04:32.640> bun<00:04:33.080> put<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> dab<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.410> glue

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
little part of her bun put a dab of glue

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.210 
little part of her bun put a dab of glue
gently<00:04:35.280> press<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.700> thread<00:04:35.970> into<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.360> glue

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
gently press the thread into the glue

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.920 
gently press the thread into the glue
and<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.400> we're<00:04:38.850> kind<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.150> taking<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.660> piece

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
and so we're kind of taking this piece

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.550 
and so we're kind of taking this piece
of<00:04:40.110> thread<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.850> looping<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:41.940> around<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.690> a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
of thread and looping it around and a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.670 
of thread and looping it around and a
spiral<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.460> back<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.760> her<00:04:44.880> head<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.680> then

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
spiral on the back of her head and then

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.230 
spiral on the back of her head and then
I'm<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:47.160> going<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.460> go<00:04:47.610> all<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.970> way<00:04:48.000> around

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
I'm just going to go all the way around

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.340 
I'm just going to go all the way around
again<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.020> back<00:04:49.200> up<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.620> top<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.780> at<00:04:52.080> this

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
again and back up to the top so at this

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.870 
again and back up to the top so at this
point<00:04:52.740> we'll<00:04:52.890> have<00:04:52.919> looped<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.460> around<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
point we'll have looped it around the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.219 
point we'll have looped it around the
back<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.180> her<00:04:54.390> head<00:04:54.690> twice

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.270 

okay<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:01.290> once<00:05:01.530> you've<00:05:01.680> reached<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.100> top

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
okay so once you've reached the top

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.860 
okay so once you've reached the top
again<00:05:02.550> we're<00:05:02.790> going<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.060> twist<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.540> some<00:05:03.750> more

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
again we're going to twist it some more

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.969 
again we're going to twist it some more
and<00:05:05.540> we're<00:05:06.540> actually<00:05:06.720> going<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.320> press<00:05:07.800> it

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
and we're actually going to press it

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.860 
and we're actually going to press it
into<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.340> center<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.180> little<00:05:09.510> bun<00:05:09.720> that

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
into the center of this little bun that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.900 
into the center of this little bun that
we've<00:05:10.020> created<00:05:10.260> for<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.830> put<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.100> big<00:05:11.400> dab<00:05:11.729> of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
we've created for so I put a big dab of

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.379 
we've created for so I put a big dab of
glue<00:05:12.650> kind<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.070> center<00:05:14.370> there<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.850> I'm

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
glue kind of in the center there and I'm

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.990 
glue kind of in the center there and I'm
going<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.660> twist<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.229> tightly<00:05:19.639> press<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.850> down

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
going to twist it tightly press it down

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.490 
going to twist it tightly press it down
firmly<00:05:21.479> and<00:05:22.850> press<00:05:23.850> with<00:05:24.150> my<00:05:24.360> fingernail<00:05:24.840> the

hair<00:05:25.830> into<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.580> center<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.900> little<00:05:28.139> bun

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
hair into the center of the little bun

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.980 
hair into the center of the little bun
that<00:05:28.440> we've<00:05:28.590> created<00:05:28.889> now<00:05:29.880> smooth<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.690> piece

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
that we've created now smooth that piece

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.379 
that we've created now smooth that piece
out<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.620> we're<00:05:31.830> going<00:05:32.100> to<00:05:32.370> trim<00:05:32.760> it<00:05:32.820> off<00:05:33.090> as

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
out and we're going to trim it off as

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.590 
out and we're going to trim it off as
close<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:34.350> her<00:05:34.620> bun<00:05:34.830> as<00:05:35.130> possible<00:05:35.850> so<00:05:36.449> you'll

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
close to her bun as possible so you'll

little section of that hair right to

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.930 
little section of that hair right to
meet<00:05:58.440> right<00:05:58.800> where<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.070> bun<00:05:59.220> starts<00:05:59.610> just<00:05:59.820> to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
meet right where the bun starts just to

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.700

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
then I like to twist mine

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.070 
then I like to twist mine
down<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.760> instead<00:06:05.760> of<00:06:05.910> twisting<00:06:06.419> it<00:06:06.539> up<00:06:06.750> and

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
down and instead of twisting it up and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.320 
down and instead of twisting it up and
around<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.620> looping<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.099> I<00:06:08.340> twist<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.150> down

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
around and looping it I twist it down

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.300 
around and looping it I twist it down
and<00:06:09.570> then<00:06:09.690> I'm<00:06:09.780> going<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.110> put<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:10.680> small<00:06:10.979> dab<00:06:11.130> of

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
and then I'm going to put a small dab of

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.790 
and then I'm going to put a small dab of
glue<00:06:11.400> and<00:06:11.639> start<00:06:12.000> to<00:06:12.180> twist<00:06:12.419> it<00:06:12.690> up<00:06:12.870> so<00:06:13.650> we're

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
glue and start to twist it up so we're

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.520 
glue and start to twist it up so we're
almost<00:06:13.950> going<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.580> opposite<00:06:15.180> direction

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
almost going in the opposite direction

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.050 
almost going in the opposite direction
we<00:06:16.530> want<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:16.919> cover<00:06:17.099> up<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.340> little<00:06:17.729> section

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
we want to cover up that little section

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.770 
we want to cover up that little section
of<00:06:18.389> scruffy<00:06:19.139> hair<00:06:19.169> that<00:06:19.620> we<00:06:19.710> had<00:06:19.860> cut<00:06:20.070> off<00:06:20.099> and

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.480 
of scruffy hair that we had cut off and
so<00:06:21.780> almost<00:06:22.680> like<00:06:22.800> a<00:06:22.919> French<00:06:23.340> twist<00:06:24.080> I'm<00:06:25.490> going

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
so almost like a French twist I'm going

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.580 
so almost like a French twist I'm going
to<00:06:29.330> smooth<00:06:30.330> it<00:06:30.479> out<00:06:30.690> and<00:06:30.750> when<00:06:31.110> I<00:06:31.139> get<00:06:31.229> it<00:06:31.470> to

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
thread that we cut off at the beginning

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.820 
thread that we cut off at the beginning
that's<00:06:36.150> where<00:06:36.389> this<00:06:36.539> comes<00:06:36.840> into<00:06:37.320> play<00:06:37.530> and

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
