 the login skin in this case was here 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.489
 animated when you see it I do not know 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.320
 which one will be but you can change it and 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.840
 also time we can change the music 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.340
 of login that we can think about 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 that the one that is in the moment is very 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 boring and we want another the image is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.479
 that is quiet if we remove it is going to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.990
 I'm not going to tell you how to change it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 that is a bit silly since all the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.640
 the world has it animated let's start how 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.979
 change the login screen first we close 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.290
 the book of legends let's go to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.680
 computer disk ce 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.720
 riot games this is where I have I say 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.220
 installed player so from here to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 everyone will be equal league of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.820
 legends rats projects what client read 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.140
 release is and we go to the folder below 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.940
 completely if it is empty 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:44.050
 just the previous diploid assets and 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.660
 now let's go to swf s I'll leave you 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.760
 a folder to download in the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.320
 description of what will be all 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.570
 these funds those who have seen the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.400
 introduction are these here and these 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.340
 that are unproven are ones that I have not 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.399
 proven I thrive on van all 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.409
 we take a background of these for example the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.799
 weak and frank that I like a lot of control 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.110
 ce and control v we have it here now 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.220
 the background that is like login we are going to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.170
 change it to login 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.630
 1 just in case they are worth of the leaf bank 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.350
 leblanc allowing where you are 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.890
 we minimize to see if it works 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.890
 place 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.270
 and this is working correctly 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.610
 personalized background if for a casual 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.740
 you want to return to the original the only thing 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.880
 you have to do is remove the login 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.210
 what we have created 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.990
 and the 1 remove the login 1 we change it 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.560
 by login 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.190
 we close law league of legends 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 the place 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.590
 and this has already returned to normal 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.300
 is how you change the login type now 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.430
 let's go to how to change the music 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.410
 as you can see the music of zack is very 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.900
 boring and we want a great song 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.540
 more rolled up so the first thing that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.760
 we do is close the league of legends and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 in the directory where we have league of 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.780
 legends installed on the disk cervio 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.920
 trains and now you see here for all the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.440
 world will also be the same league 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.650

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.130

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.810
 to go environment 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.090
 now the song that we want to catch 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.300
 You can choose the one you want only 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.110
 it has to be 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.410
 in mp3 format we take the song that 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.410

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.749

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:30.099
 and by login screen blog is required 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.419

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.550
 capitals as written 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.259
 before with the capital letters at the beginning of 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.249
 each login word of the screen and the 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:42.409
 loop we do not minimize 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.409
