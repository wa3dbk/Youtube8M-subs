00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
here we will have here for this season I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
here we will have here for this season I
think<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.460> three<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> them<00:00:35.969> are

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
think that all three of them are

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.220 
think that all three of them are
exceptional<00:00:36.600> pieces<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.460> I<00:00:38.719> especially<00:00:39.719> like

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
exceptional pieces and I especially like

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
that with some of our own staff and that
somehow<00:01:01.050> spread<00:01:01.500> around<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
somehow spread around and then I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.450 
somehow spread around and then I
realized<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.559> whole<00:01:04.710> technical<00:01:05.220> side

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
realized that the whole technical side

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820 
realized that the whole technical side
or<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.939> officers<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.500> empty

or the officers they were all empty

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
or the officers they were all empty
