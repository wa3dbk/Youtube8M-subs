00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.220
 ok let's start to see how 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.800
 we explained the tutorial he got the band 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.990
 of our merit of all the voice the 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.370
 song cost originally of two 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.930
 tones 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.940
 4 all but divided into two parts 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 the first all of the song is he 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.910
 with lower investment the lower is the lower 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 so we see 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.520
 B flat passes to two of the tickets 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.520
 unless it's something like 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.580
 we'll see 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 two 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.580
 do not 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.950
 let's see the following 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.950
 to pass like this from bad pam pam 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.489
 we go to the network 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.050
 then the song in half is passed to 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.050
 tone of the minor the same with the lower 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.810
 network and here and my greatest 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.850
 we start again here where 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.850
 begins with minor sun 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.580
 i 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.880
 i 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.570
 for having a better time 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.230
 do not 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.850
 good 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.530
 Of course this is with both hands and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.570
 obviously you have to do it with your hand 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.650
 right and left hand more or less 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.650
 it would sound something like that 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:31.450
 yes 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:34.360
 and obviously with both hands good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.490
 but having helped him in this piece that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.470
 It is very is very beautiful and very easy as 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.470
 can you see you can realize
