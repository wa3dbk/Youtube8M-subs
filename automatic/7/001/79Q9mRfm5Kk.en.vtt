00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
which looks like that I really like it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.100 
which looks like that I really like it
really<00:02:10.259> nice<00:02:10.590> simple

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
really nice simple

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.020 
really nice simple
design<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> balls<00:02:12.100> in<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.460> plane<00:02:12.670> again

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
design with the balls in the plane again

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.170 
design with the balls in the plane again
really<00:02:13.900> cool<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.830> if<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.910> me<00:02:16.030> well

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
really cool and if you know me well

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.400 
really cool and if you know me well
you'll<00:02:16.420> know<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.780> don't<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.050> guarantee

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you'll know that I don't I guarantee

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.190 
you'll know that I don't I guarantee
Jokers<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.580> guess<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.870> kind<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
Jokers but I guess this one is kind of a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.060 
Jokers but I guess this one is kind of a
deception<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.860> kind<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.950> looks

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
deception I kind of like this it looks

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.340 
deception I kind of like this it looks
pretty<00:02:24.400> nice<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.820> think<00:02:27.750> they<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:29.080> come<00:02:29.230> with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
pretty nice I think they just come with

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.440 
pretty nice I think they just come with
the<00:02:29.530> two<00:02:29.740> accounts<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.060> ones<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.360> would

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the two accounts the ones you would

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.880 
the two accounts the ones you would
usually<00:02:31.630> see<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.080> bicycle<00:02:32.500> back<00:02:32.650> for

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
usually see in a bicycle back for

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
usually see in a bicycle back for
example<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.240> for<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> royal<00:02:34.660> fella<00:02:34.990> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
example the one for a royal fella and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.070 
example the one for a royal fella and
the<00:02:35.550> personalized<00:02:36.550> card<00:02:37.740> thing<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> onto<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
the personalized card thing so onto the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.270 
the personalized card thing so onto the
cards<00:02:41.500> themselves<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.520> as<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.660> can<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:44.280> I'm

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
cards themselves now as you can see I'm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.730 
cards themselves now as you can see I'm
a<00:02:45.400> Casper<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.200> faces<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.709> just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
a Casper you can see the faces are just

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.840 
a Casper you can see the faces are just
basically<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.580> your<00:02:48.910> normal<00:02:49.030> bicycle<00:02:49.420> back

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
basically like your normal bicycle back

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.390 
basically like your normal bicycle back
all<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.150> shapes<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.690> bits<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.140> colors<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
all the shapes the bits the colors the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600 
all the shapes the bits the colors the
same<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:55.239> see<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.570> core<00:02:55.780> cards<00:02:56.140> are<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.320> same

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
same you see the core cards are the same

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.970 
same you see the core cards are the same
as<00:02:57.610> bicycle<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.720> Kings<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.410> jacks<00:02:59.830> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
as bicycle the Kings and the jacks and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.190 
as bicycle the Kings and the jacks and
everything<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.420> only<00:03:01.570> difference<00:03:01.750> would

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
everything but the only difference would

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.110 
everything but the only difference would
be<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.530> course<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.980> ace<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.280> spades<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.940> they

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
be of course the ace of spades if they

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.970 
be of course the ace of spades if they
put<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.360> bicycle<00:03:04.720> Isis<00:03:05.320> aids<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.739> deck

put the bicycle Isis aids in this deck

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.420 
put the bicycle Isis aids in this deck
can<00:03:06.580> get<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.940> ruinous<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.739> no<00:03:09.100> they

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
can get just ruinous on it but no they

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.510 
can get just ruinous on it but no they
do<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.110> 88<00:03:11.560> ace<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.950> spades<00:03:12.220> which<00:03:12.370> I

really<00:03:12.820> like<00:03:13.000> really<00:03:13.540> nice<00:03:13.660> simple<00:03:14.020> design

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
really like really nice simple design

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.199 
really like really nice simple design
with<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.190> basket<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.760> cross<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.120> the

with the basket and the cross and the
Spade<00:03:16.510> pip<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.989> think<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.860> looks<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.340> cool

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
Spade pip I think it looks really cool

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.479 
Spade pip I think it looks really cool
you<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:19.239> make<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.570> own<00:03:19.720> decision<00:03:19.900> or<00:03:20.260> not

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
you can make up your own decision or not

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.259 
you can make up your own decision or not
but<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.519> really<00:03:21.880> like<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
but I really like it

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.979 
but I really like it
um<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.380> back<00:03:23.560> design<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:25.239> may<00:03:25.420> think<00:03:25.780> at

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
um the back design you may think at

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.600 
um the back design you may think at
first<00:03:26.230> it's<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.500> little<00:03:26.739> bland

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
first it's a little bland

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.580 
first it's a little bland
a<00:03:27.700> little<00:03:27.910> boring<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.900> kind<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.440> looks

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
a little boring and it kind of looks

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.229 
a little boring and it kind of looks
like<00:03:29.650> one<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:29.950> those<00:03:30.040> decks<00:03:30.370> you've<00:03:30.549> got<00:03:30.880> a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
like one of those decks you've got a

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.960 
like one of those decks you've got a
really<00:03:31.780> cheap<00:03:32.170> supermarket<00:03:32.650> or<00:03:33.580> something

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
really cheap supermarket or something

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.030 
really cheap supermarket or something
like<00:03:34.090> that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
like that

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.470 
like that
but<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.280> guess<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.610> kind<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.910> wanted<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.360> you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
but I guess you kind of wanted that you

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.759 
but I guess you kind of wanted that you
want<00:03:37.600> your<00:03:37.720> spectators<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.380> think<00:03:38.620> it's

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
want your spectators to think it's

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.440 
want your spectators to think it's
completely<00:03:39.340> normal<00:03:39.489> deck<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.820> cards<00:03:40.239> for<00:03:40.299> me

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
completely normal deck of cards for me

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.470 
completely normal deck of cards for me
for<00:03:40.900> example<00:03:41.140> if<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.980> were<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.190> use<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:43.180> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
for example if you were to use this and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600 
for example if you were to use this and
a<00:03:43.510> performance<00:03:44.019> there<00:03:44.230> probably<00:03:44.610> immediately

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
a performance there probably immediately

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.820 
a performance there probably immediately
gather<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.299> trick<00:03:46.690> deck<00:03:46.870> when<00:03:47.650> it's

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
gather that is a trick deck when it's

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.539 
gather that is a trick deck when it's
usually<00:03:48.250> not<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:49.150> anyway<00:03:50.190> that's<00:03:51.190> basically

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
usually not but anyway that's basically

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.300 
usually not but anyway that's basically
the<00:03:51.760> cards<00:03:52.060> look<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.570> it's<00:03:53.440> not<00:03:53.620> too<00:03:53.769> bad<00:03:53.950> it's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the cards look and it's not too bad it's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.660 
the cards look and it's not too bad it's
not<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.670> best<00:03:54.820> either<00:03:55.030> sure<00:03:55.870> you'll<00:03:56.019> agree

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
not the best either sure you'll agree

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.520 
not the best either sure you'll agree
now<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.730> handling<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.959> finish<00:03:59.290> on<00:03:59.440> these

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
now the handling the finish on these

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.580 
now the handling the finish on these
cards<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.180> little<00:04:01.480> different<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:02.380> you're

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
cards is a little different if you're

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.130 
cards is a little different if you're
used<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:03.000> bicycles<00:04:04.000> tally<00:04:04.390> hose<00:04:04.600> things<00:04:04.989> like

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
used to bicycles tally hose things like

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.120 
used to bicycles tally hose things like
that<00:04:05.350> cetera<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.440> little<00:04:08.680> different<00:04:09.100> I

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
that cetera it is a little different I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.740 
that cetera it is a little different I
mean<00:04:09.220> when<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.489> take<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.700> bicycle<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.540> for

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
mean when you take a bicycle that for

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.050 
mean when you take a bicycle that for
example<00:04:10.959> most<00:04:11.500> take<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.670> these<00:04:12.790> bikes

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.580 

if<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.240> look<00:04:16.360> at<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.540> card<00:04:16.750> closely<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.500> if

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
if you look at the card closely and if

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.490 
if you look at the card closely and if
you<00:04:17.680> feel<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.750> really<00:04:19.750> examine<00:04:19.990> they<00:04:20.260> fold

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
you feel it and really examine they fold

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.230 
you feel it and really examine they fold
you'll<00:04:21.040> see<00:04:21.190> there's<00:04:21.400> little<00:04:21.520> dimples<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you'll see there's little dimples and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.290 
you'll see there's little dimples and
gridlines<00:04:22.690> going<00:04:23.050> up<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.350> down<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.770> code<00:04:24.300> but

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
gridlines going up and down the code but

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.050 
gridlines going up and down the code but
ladies<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.470> not<00:04:27.190> like<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.880> just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
ladies it's not like that it is just

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.770 
ladies it's not like that it is just
completely<00:04:28.300> smooth<00:04:28.930> like<00:04:29.320> glass<00:04:29.590> smooth<00:04:30.780> it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
completely smooth like glass smooth it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.120 
completely smooth like glass smooth it
is<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:31.990> little<00:04:32.260> different<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.740> will<00:04:32.920> take<00:04:33.100> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
is a little different and will take a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.310 
is a little different and will take a
little<00:04:33.340> while<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.610> get<00:04:33.910> used<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:34.990> I

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
little while to get used to but I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.590 
little while to get used to but I
already<00:04:36.130> think<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.700> should<00:04:36.850> give<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.090> try

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
already think you should give it a try

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.930 
already think you should give it a try
I've<00:04:37.840> really<00:04:38.170> grown<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.010> I'm

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
I've really grown to like it and I'm

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.840 
I've really grown to like it and I'm
sure<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.330> will<00:04:40.450> too

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
sure you will too

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.550 
sure you will too
but<00:04:42.850> now<00:04:43.150> people<00:04:43.600> really<00:04:43.990> moan<00:04:44.320> about

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
but now people really moan about

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.350 
but now people really moan about
aviators<00:04:45.220> when<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.430> comes<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.730> Fanning<00:04:46.120> but<00:04:46.270> I

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
aviators when it comes to Fanning but I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.120 
aviators when it comes to Fanning but I
don't<00:04:46.540> actually<00:04:46.600> think<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.110> bad<00:04:47.290> when

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
don't actually think it's that bad when

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.760 
don't actually think it's that bad when
you<00:04:48.220> first<00:04:48.430> buy<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.700> duck<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.530> seriously<00:04:50.530> is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
you first buy the duck is seriously is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.560 
you first buy the duck is seriously is
there<00:04:51.010> seriously<00:04:51.430> good<00:04:51.850> finding<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.330> like

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
there seriously good finding that like

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.630 
there seriously good finding that like
each<00:04:52.870> card<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.380> evenly<00:04:53.770> placed<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.460> looks

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
each card is evenly placed and it looks

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.800 
each card is evenly placed and it looks
really<00:04:55.000> cool<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.950> over<00:04:57.280> over<00:04:57.790> time<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.570> will

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
really cool and over over time it will

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
really cool and over over time it will
just<00:04:58.840> get<00:04:59.200> clumpy<00:04:59.770> any<00:05:00.400> deck<00:05:00.700> will<00:05:01.230> but<00:05:02.230> as<00:05:02.800> you

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
just get clumpy any deck will but as you

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.620 
just get clumpy any deck will but as you
can<00:05:02.980> see<00:05:03.040> it's<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.370> about<00:05:03.510> people<00:05:04.510> do

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
can see it's not about people do

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.420 
can see it's not about people do
complain<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:05.050> lot<00:05:05.290> about<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.620> fining<00:05:05.920> look<00:05:06.130> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
complain a lot about the fining look I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.250 
complain a lot about the fining look I
honestly<00:05:06.910> don't<00:05:07.060> think<00:05:07.180> it's<00:05:07.480> it's<00:05:07.900> all<00:05:08.020> about

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
honestly don't think it's it's all about

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.170 
honestly don't think it's it's all about
and<00:05:08.530> besides<00:05:08.860> funding<00:05:09.310> isn't<00:05:09.430> everything<00:05:09.910> so

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
and besides funding isn't everything so

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.920 
and besides funding isn't everything so
the<00:05:11.140> deck<00:05:11.320> does<00:05:11.590> spread<00:05:12.270> really<00:05:13.270> nicely<00:05:13.600> as

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
the deck does spread really nicely as

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.530 
the deck does spread really nicely as
you<00:05:13.990> can<00:05:14.170> see<00:05:14.350> really<00:05:14.890> nice<00:05:15.130> even<00:05:15.540> ribbon

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
you can see really nice even ribbon

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.670 
you can see really nice even ribbon
spread<00:05:16.660> occurring<00:05:17.170> across<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:20.320> course<00:05:20.530> I

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
spread occurring across and of course I

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.200 
spread occurring across and of course I
do<00:05:20.740> like<00:05:20.950> these<00:05:21.100> cards<00:05:21.400> for<00:05:21.430> magic<00:05:21.850> because

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
do like these cards for magic because

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.610 
do like these cards for magic because
they<00:05:22.900> do<00:05:22.960> look<00:05:23.230> so<00:05:23.500> blunt<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.460> boring<00:05:24.880> so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
they do look so blunt and boring so

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.160 
they do look so blunt and boring so
that's<00:05:26.620> also<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:26.980> good<00:05:27.160> thing<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.960> really<00:05:28.960> like

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
that's also a good thing I really like

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.110 
that's also a good thing I really like
these<00:05:29.380> cards<00:05:29.830> for<00:05:30.010> actually<00:05:30.310> cuts<00:05:30.700> and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
these cards for actually cuts and

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.520 
these cards for actually cuts and
flourishes<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.990> was<00:05:32.920> giving<00:05:33.160> you<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.280> quick

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
flourishes I was giving you a quick

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.630 
flourishes I was giving you a quick
performance<00:05:35.530> now<00:05:35.680> this<00:05:36.070> could<00:05:36.280> be<00:05:36.340> messy

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
performance now this could be messy

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.410 
performance now this could be messy
because<00:05:36.850> I'm<00:05:37.090> doing<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:37.750> low<00:05:37.960> down<00:05:39.420> but

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
because I'm doing it so low down but

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.350 
because I'm doing it so low down but
yeah<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:42.310> get<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.610> idea

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
yeah you get the idea

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.280 
yeah you get the idea
I<00:05:44.700> do<00:05:45.700> really<00:05:46.450> like<00:05:46.660> these<00:05:46.870> kinds<00:05:47.200> of

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
I do really like these kinds of

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.960 
I do really like these kinds of
flourishes<00:05:47.710> these<00:05:47.860> are<00:05:48.070> some<00:05:48.310> of<00:05:48.340> my<00:05:48.430> regular

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
flourishes these are some of my regular

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.720 
flourishes these are some of my regular
flourishing<00:05:49.420> costs<00:05:49.810> I<00:05:53.370> don't<00:05:54.370> know<00:05:54.430> what<00:05:54.580> you

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
flourishing costs I don't know what you

the deck is really rigid as doesn't make

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.970 
the deck is really rigid as doesn't make
it<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.210> little<00:06:13.390> different<00:06:14.290> for<00:06:14.500> Springs<00:06:14.830> and

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
it a little different for Springs and

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.980 
it a little different for Springs and
stuff<00:06:16.230> Springs<00:06:17.250> water<00:06:18.250> falls<00:06:18.990> everything

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 
like that but egg dribbles really well

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.739 
like that but egg dribbles really well
really<00:06:22.659> nice<00:06:22.809> clean<00:06:23.139> dribbles<00:06:24.629> which<00:06:25.629> I

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:25.749 
really nice clean dribbles which I

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:30.179 
really nice clean dribbles which I
really<00:06:26.080> like<00:06:27.599> yeah<00:06:28.599> I<00:06:28.930> really<00:06:29.800> really<00:06:30.039> like

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
really like yeah I really really like

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.439 
really like yeah I really really like
the<00:06:30.400> stack<00:06:30.639> before<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.719> think<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.199> rated<00:06:32.409> it<00:06:32.680> like

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
the stack before I think I rated it like

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.439 
the stack before I think I rated it like
7.5<00:06:34.449> or<00:06:34.629> something<00:06:34.990> which<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.370> completely

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
7.5 or something which is completely

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.459 
7.5 or something which is completely
opposite<00:06:37.449> to<00:06:37.539> what<00:06:37.629> I<00:06:37.719> think<00:06:38.050> now

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
opposite to what I think now

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.739 
opposite to what I think now
I<00:06:38.499> probably<00:06:39.129> rate<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.550> stack<00:06:39.729> like<00:06:39.879> an<00:06:40.029> 8.5

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:40.749 
I probably rate the stack like an 8.5

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.379 
I probably rate the stack like an 8.5
maybe<00:06:41.080> I<00:06:41.349> do<00:06:41.710> like<00:06:42.039> it<00:06:42.219> that<00:06:42.370> quite<00:06:42.699> a<00:06:42.729> lot<00:06:42.999> more

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
maybe I do like it that quite a lot more

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.559 
maybe I do like it that quite a lot more
than<00:06:43.629> a<00:06:43.719> bicycle<00:06:43.960> duck<00:06:44.349> I<00:06:44.969> use<00:06:45.969> it<00:06:46.120> for<00:06:46.270> magic

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569 
than a bicycle duck I use it for magic

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.469 
than a bicycle duck I use it for magic
performances<00:06:47.199> as<00:06:47.620> much<00:06:48.129> as<00:06:48.309> I<00:06:48.370> do<00:06:48.449> with<00:06:49.449> a

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
performances as much as I do with a

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.350 
performances as much as I do with a
bicycle<00:06:49.809> deck<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.349> use<00:06:51.129> it<00:06:51.339> so<00:06:51.939> much<00:06:52.150> before

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
bicycle deck I use it so much before

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.540 
bicycle deck I use it so much before
showing<00:06:52.779> I<00:06:52.839> have<00:06:53.020> some<00:06:53.319> really<00:06:53.559> used<00:06:54.039> text<00:06:54.430> and
