00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 we are the collective of the globe 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 skopje we are a history group 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.419
 artists in Bogota that we are interested in 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.389
 how to arm new spaces for comics 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:18.090
 in this city and today we are going to make a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.920
 fanzine that development say follow without 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.890
 creator a mathematician and a cartoonist 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.540
 Californian who is obsessed with 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 make stories with many options and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.210
 as with many endings it seems like a fan of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 four finals 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 we need a letter size sheet some 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.800
 scissors and drawing materials what 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.010
 first thing we have to do is go back 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 the sheet of a square then you have 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.540
 to start in nine squares then 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.300
 on one side we have the grid 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.600
 we have to draw an arrow from above 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.840
 down 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 in this second box and an arrow of 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.700
 left to right in the last frame 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.310
 Now let's see what happens on the other side 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.310
 I flip the sheet like this 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.660
 I have to draw an arrow from above to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.300
 down in the first frame and in the last 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.570
 picture an arrow up after 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.360
 with the scissors we make two cuts for 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.000
 here around this half date 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.650
 and another here from here what we have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.360
 to make two cuts and we are left with 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.440
 three tentacles of the tentacle of the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.050
 half we make a cut down and a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.780
 cut up we have one envelope left 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.930
 this line here we make a cut where 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 we passed everything is most of the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.800
 body above 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 then on this line they are going to fold 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.390
 the whole body of the fancine leaving everything 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.549
 this is so 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.070
 with this we grab you is what was left 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.530
 this side we talk down then 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.420
 there is an inside out basically and the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.759
 penultimate folds this on this 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.700
 line so that they remain as one and a 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.799
 stick then we do doubles and as we already 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 we had painted a left arrow 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.880
 to the right should appear when you do the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.970
 double the last you have to do 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.730
 is on this one 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.280
 and ya and just then you start like 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.960
 draw the idea in principle then it is that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.030
 one this can reproduce it very 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.400
 easily in a photocopier that's why 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.010
 the advice is to plan everything after 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.840
 unfold it and make a version let's say 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 final that you can take the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.500
 photocopier 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.650
 it is important to discover that all the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.110
 world is creative that everyone does not have the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 ability to draw storytelling 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.920
 and that sometimes we let ourselves be distracted by 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.750
 production costs because things 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.980
 They look very professional and we do not 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.129
 we ventured to do things hopefully this one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.319
 cheer up with this bread without making your 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.750
 own their own things if they really 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.700
 they can not draw 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.520
 the rules are not written so 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.770
 can write or can collect photos 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.610
 or things that seem interesting and 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.610
 make your own publications
