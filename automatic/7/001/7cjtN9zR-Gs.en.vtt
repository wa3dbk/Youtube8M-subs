00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.210
 trick it's magic frieze low you have to 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.660
 know I do not think people 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.890
 this year 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:01:18.030

 it was a special plastic glue all 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:42.140
 alone in fact I think it takes 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:02:02.080
 take it off the light and the straw and the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:02:02.080
 instructions then ok 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:13.710
 in fact and elbow bags at mali on 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.710

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.150

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.150

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.520

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:41.980
