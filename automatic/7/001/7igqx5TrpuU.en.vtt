00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
think I was like in second grade when it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.599 
think I was like in second grade when it
came<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> Dreamcast<00:00:26.670> ah<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.830> want<00:00:29.550> to

lives<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> hype<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.480> $5.00<00:00:34.430> isn't

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
lives up to the hype because $5.00 isn't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.240 
lives up to the hype because $5.00 isn't
really<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.600> guess<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> could<00:00:37.620> call<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
really I guess you could call it and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.240 
really I guess you could call it and
it's<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.379> impulse<00:00:40.379> buy<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:42.030> does

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
it's not really a impulse buy it does

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's not really a impulse buy it does
require<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:45.800> yeah<00:00:46.800> yeah<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:49.110> mean<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
require some yeah yeah I mean if you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.319 
require some yeah yeah I mean if you
remember<00:00:50.190> back<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> Dreamcast<00:00:51.030> day<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
remember back in the Dreamcast day this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.100 
remember back in the Dreamcast day this
thing<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.809> 50<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.890> 40<00:00:53.160> bucks<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
thing was like 50 or 40 bucks so this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.420 
thing was like 50 or 40 bucks so this
seems<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.460> steal<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.239> $5.00<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> from

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
seems like a steal for $5.00 and from

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
seems like a steal for $5.00 and from
what<00:00:59.820> I've<00:00:59.940> been<00:01:00.059> seeing<00:01:00.329> three<00:01:00.690> views<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> the

this<00:03:19.159> down<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.700> bit<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:21.260> it's<00:03:21.769> got

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
this down just a little bit but it's got

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.740 
this down just a little bit but it's got
the<00:03:22.250> old-school<00:03:22.640> soundtrack<00:03:23.390> they're<00:03:23.629> able
