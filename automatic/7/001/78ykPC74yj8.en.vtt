00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030 

so<00:00:32.830> I<00:00:32.860> put<00:00:33.280> up<00:00:33.400> the<00:00:33.670> ceiling<00:00:34.090> fan<00:00:34.330> motor<00:00:35.040> with

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
so I put up the ceiling fan motor with

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.530 
so I put up the ceiling fan motor with
the<00:00:36.160> would<00:00:36.400> place<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:39.070> they're<00:00:39.640> not<00:00:39.910> turning

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
the would place but they're not turning

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.130 
the would place but they're not turning
either

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.630 

I<00:00:47.170> was<00:00:48.160> following<00:00:48.490> fan<00:00:49.360> bro<00:00:49.690> house<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:51.430> of

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
I was following fan bro house way of

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.720 
I was following fan bro house way of
making<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.240> blades<00:00:52.540> for<00:00:53.640> ceiling<00:00:54.640> fan<00:00:56.730> so

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
making the blades for ceiling fan so

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.690 
making the blades for ceiling fan so
next<00:00:58.060> thing<00:00:58.180> I'm<00:00:58.510> gonna<00:00:58.720> do<00:00:59.080> these<00:00:59.530> are<00:00:59.830> 24

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
next thing I'm gonna do these are 24

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.930 
next thing I'm gonna do these are 24
inches<00:01:01.240> I'm<00:01:01.660> gonna<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:03.370> them<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.580> little

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
inches I'm gonna make them a little

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:12.570 
inches I'm gonna make them a little
longer<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.479> barely<00:01:10.900> turns<00:01:11.380> I'm<00:01:12.070> gonna<00:01:12.340> make

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
longer it barely turns I'm gonna make

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
longer it barely turns I'm gonna make
them<00:01:12.760> like<00:01:13.090> five<00:01:13.420> feet<00:01:13.720> instead<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.350> four<00:01:14.710> feet

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
them like five feet instead of four feet

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.660 
them like five feet instead of four feet
using<00:01:17.550> mud<00:01:18.550> man's<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.550> coughing<00:01:21.550> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
using mud man's way of coughing the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.380 
using mud man's way of coughing the
blades<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:23.080> they're<00:01:23.350> more<00:01:26.610> aerodynamic<00:01:27.610> more

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
blades so they're more aerodynamic more

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.560 
blades so they're more aerodynamic more
airfoil<00:01:28.990> shape<00:01:29.380> instead<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:31.150> track

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
airfoil shape instead of these track

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.820 
airfoil shape instead of these track
type<00:01:34.590> blades

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
type blades

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.490 
type blades
it<00:01:36.820> wouldn't<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.180> make<00:01:37.390> any<00:01:37.570> difference<00:01:38.229> in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
it wouldn't have make any difference in

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.550 
it wouldn't have make any difference in
the<00:01:38.619> startup<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.399> think<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.320> type<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the startup I think with this type of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.680 
the startup I think with this type of
place<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.280> would<00:01:42.460> have<00:01:42.670> started<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
place it would have started just the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.940 
place it would have started just the
same<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:46.360> when<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.810> gets<00:01:47.020> up<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.410> speed

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
same it's just when it gets up to speed

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.639 
same it's just when it gets up to speed
the<00:01:48.340> lift<00:01:48.729> height<00:01:49.030> blades<00:01:49.720> would<00:01:50.110> turn<00:01:50.380> much

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
the lift height blades would turn much

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.190 
the lift height blades would turn much
better<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.600> I'm<00:01:53.260> gonna<00:01:53.500> make<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:54.580> 5<00:01:55.000> feet<00:01:55.840> once

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
better so I'm gonna make be 5 feet once

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.469 
better so I'm gonna make be 5 feet once
and<00:01:56.560> say<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> 4<00:01:57.220> feet<00:01:57.460> over<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.360> have

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and say that the 4 feet over that I have

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.710 
and say that the 4 feet over that I have
on<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:58.870> because<00:01:59.620> the<00:02:00.400> 4<00:02:00.640> feet<00:02:00.850> obviously<00:02:01.090> are

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
on now because the 4 feet obviously are

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.070 
on now because the 4 feet obviously are
not<00:02:03.150> long<00:02:04.150> enough<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.810> make<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.920> difference<00:02:06.369> so

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
not long enough to make a difference so

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.670 
not long enough to make a difference so
before<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.110> actually<00:02:10.230> call<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.980> McMahons<00:02:13.680> wood

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
before I actually call the McMahons wood

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.130 
before I actually call the McMahons wood
blade<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.630> use<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.930> scrap<00:02:17.440> piece<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.769> 4-foot

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
blade I use this scrap piece of 4-foot

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.880 
blade I use this scrap piece of 4-foot
2x4<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.549> try<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.630> knock<00:02:22.630> down<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.170> dimensions

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
2x4 and try to knock down the dimensions

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.009 
2x4 and try to knock down the dimensions
I<00:02:24.220> cut<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.640> from<00:02:25.709> buddy's<00:02:26.709> videos<00:02:28.019> somehow

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
I cut them from buddy's videos somehow

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.640 
I cut them from buddy's videos somehow
this<00:02:29.590> part<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.010> got<00:02:30.220> wrong<00:02:30.519> it's<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.150> b2y<00:02:32.459> and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
this part I got wrong it's like b2y and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390 
this part I got wrong it's like b2y and
this<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.070> leading<00:02:36.280> edge<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:38.350> sort<00:02:39.340> of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
this is the leading edge it sort of

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.819 
this is the leading edge it sort of
tapers<00:02:40.180> down<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:43.140> goes<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.470> end

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
tapers down and then goes to the end

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.900 
tapers down and then goes to the end
here<00:02:45.430> all<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.329> part<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.900> wood<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.760> would<00:02:48.760> have

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
here all this part of wood I would have

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.860 
here all this part of wood I would have
to<00:02:49.090> cut<00:02:49.360> out<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:52.120> part<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.690> wood

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
to cut out and then this part of wood

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.910 
to cut out and then this part of wood
also<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> cut<00:02:54.400> out<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.020> then<00:02:56.020> with

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
also I have to cut out and then with

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.580 
also I have to cut out and then with
this

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.330 

like<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:00.890> he<00:03:01.010> calls<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.670> venturi<00:03:03.099> or<00:03:04.099> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
like what he calls the venturi or the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.039 
like what he calls the venturi or the
airfoil<00:03:04.879> shape<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.840> leading

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
airfoil shape so this is the leading

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:18.339 
airfoil shape so this is the leading
edge<00:03:10.780> about<00:03:11.780> 1/8<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.500> an<00:03:12.739> inch<00:03:12.860> thick<00:03:17.349> and

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
edge about 1/8 of an inch thick and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.580 
edge about 1/8 of an inch thick and
that's<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.860> back<00:03:19.099> side<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
that's the back side this is the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.030 
that's the back side this is the
trailing<00:03:22.099> edge<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.019> trailing<00:03:27.349> edge

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
trailing edge this is the trailing edge

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.080 
trailing edge this is the trailing edge
I<00:03:28.069> said<00:03:28.700> reading<00:03:29.450> before<00:03:29.870> trailing<00:03:30.349> edge<00:03:31.090> this

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I said reading before trailing edge this

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.300 
I said reading before trailing edge this
is<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.690> leading<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:35.260> there's<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.349> lot<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.739> wood

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
is the leading and there's a lot of wood

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:48.880 
is the leading and there's a lot of wood
to<00:03:37.430> cut<00:03:37.609> out<00:03:37.790> from<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.680> lot<00:03:48.859> of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
to cut out from here so it's a lot of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.830 
to cut out from here so it's a lot of
work<00:03:50.230> he<00:03:51.230> makes<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.650> look<00:03:51.829> easy<00:03:52.129> I<00:03:52.780> got<00:03:53.780> a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
work he makes it look easy I got a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.160 
work he makes it look easy I got a
couple<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.260> splinters<00:03:54.799> already<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:59.170> I'll

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
couple of splinters already so I'll

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.699 
couple of splinters already so I'll
start<00:04:00.470> out<00:04:00.620> with<00:04:00.680> one<00:04:01.549> 5<00:04:02.299> foot<00:04:03.940> plate<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.720> if

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
start out with one 5 foot plate and if

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.280 
start out with one 5 foot plate and if
that<00:04:06.919> doesn't<00:04:07.220> work<00:04:07.549> make<00:04:08.329> another<00:04:08.690> one<00:04:08.930> and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290
