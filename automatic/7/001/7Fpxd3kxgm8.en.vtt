3d printers from Stratasys with the
konnex<00:00:18.539> line<00:00:18.720> you've<00:00:18.900> actually<00:00:19.050> got<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
konnex line you've actually got the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.109 
konnex line you've actually got the
ability<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.949> print<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.460> multiple<00:00:21.000> materials

here<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.260> got<00:00:22.439> vero<00:00:22.769> black<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> Euroclear

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
here I've got vero black and Euroclear

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109 
here I've got vero black and Euroclear
loaded<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.320> machine<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.519> before<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.000> get

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
loaded in the machine but before we get

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
loaded in the machine but before we get
started<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:27.689> object<00:00:28.680> studio<00:00:29.010> we're<00:00:29.189> gonna

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
started with object studio we're gonna

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.030 
started with object studio we're gonna
have<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.580> back<00:00:29.609> over<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.480> our<00:00:31.050> CAD<00:00:31.410> file<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
have to go back over to our CAD file and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
have to go back over to our CAD file and
take<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> look<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.120> we've<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.690> were

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
take a look at what we've got they were

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
take a look at what we've got they were
here<00:00:34.680> I've<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.070> assembly<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
here I've got an assembly with the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.110 
here I've got an assembly with the
letters<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> outer<00:00:37.020> block<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> if

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
letters and then the outer block and if

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
letters and then the outer block and if
we<00:00:39.210> open<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> outer<00:00:39.870> block<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.010> see

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we open up the outer block we can see

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
we open up the outer block we can see
that<00:00:41.550> I've<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.270> used<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.840> cavity<00:00:43.320> feature

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that I've actually used a cavity feature

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.880 
that I've actually used a cavity feature
to<00:00:43.829> subtract<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.329> letters<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.680> block

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to subtract the letters from the block

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.910 
to subtract the letters from the block
itself<00:00:47.360> back<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> Assembly<00:00:49.020> level<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.800> we

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
itself back at the Assembly level if we

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
itself back at the Assembly level if we
go<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> file<00:00:50.879> save<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> save

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
go over and do a file save as and save

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.549 
go over and do a file save as and save
this<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.129> STL<00:00:53.250> file<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> change

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this as an STL file we want to change

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.430 
this as an STL file we want to change
some<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> options<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> not

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
some of the options here we want to not

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
some of the options here we want to not
save<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.460> single<00:00:59.760> file<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.030> we

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
save these as one single file but we

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
save these as one single file but we
want<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> save<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.230> separate<00:01:01.649> files

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
want to save these all as separate files

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
want to save these all as separate files
so<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> file<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.600> letters<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so we want to file for the letters and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
so we want to file for the letters and
the<00:01:04.439> outer<00:01:04.619> block<00:01:05.119> I've<00:01:06.119> already<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the outer block I've already got that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
the outer block I've already got that
done<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.260> gonna<00:01:07.380> come<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.680> over<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
done so we're gonna come back over to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
done so we're gonna come back over to
object<00:01:09.000> studio<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.110> gonna<00:01:10.229> come<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
object studio and we're gonna come in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
object studio and we're gonna come in
and<00:01:10.770> we're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> insert<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> STL<00:01:12.119> files

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and we're going to insert the STL files

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.140 
and we're going to insert the STL files
here<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> ctrl<00:01:14.490> select<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.970> two

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
here we're going to ctrl select the two

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
here we're going to ctrl select the two
STL<00:01:15.600> files<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> check<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
STL files and we're going to check this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
STL files and we're going to check this
assembly<00:01:17.880> box<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.360> important<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.110> our

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
assembly box that's important for our

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
assembly box that's important for our
operation<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.119> say

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
operation here now we're gonna say

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
operation here now we're gonna say
insert<00:01:21.689> it'll<00:01:22.290> actually<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
insert it'll actually put them in at the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.810 
insert it'll actually put them in at the
same<00:01:23.340> location<00:01:24.680> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> assembly<00:01:26.700> level

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
same location from the assembly level

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.249 
same location from the assembly level
we're<00:01:27.180> gonna<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.540> over<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.780> change<00:01:27.990> those

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
we're gonna go over and change those

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
we're gonna go over and change those
both<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> glossy<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.689> come<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
both to a glossy but we can come in and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
both to a glossy but we can come in and
expand<00:01:31.710> each<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> these<00:01:32.159> guys<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.759> outer<00:01:32.939> part

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
expand each of these guys the outer part

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.830 
expand each of these guys the outer part
are<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.030> Bureau<00:01:36.030> clear<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
are going to be the Bureau clear and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.310 
are going to be the Bureau clear and
then<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> inner<00:01:38.009> part<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
then the inner part we can make that the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
then the inner part we can make that the
VL<00:01:40.560> black<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.790> over<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> future

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
VL black we can see over in the future

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.420 
VL black we can see over in the future
manager<00:01:42.960> tree<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.619> see<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
manager tree here we can see that the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.780 
manager tree here we can see that the
color<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.509> each<00:01:45.600> those<00:01:45.810> different<00:01:46.200> materials

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
color for each those different materials

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
color for each those different materials
now<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> print<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
now we probably don't want to print this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950 
now we probably don't want to print this
in<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.409> orientation<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.570> come<00:01:51.720> over

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
in this orientation so I can come over

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.639 
in this orientation so I can come over
and<00:01:52.700> from<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.060> drop-down<00:01:54.509> choose<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> select

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and from this drop-down choose a select

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
and from this drop-down choose a select
a<00:01:55.770> plane<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.329> I'm

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a plane and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.429 
a plane and what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> hold<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> middle<00:01:58.290> mouse

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

rotates us kind of about the plane of
the<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.400> platform<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.350> come<00:02:31.560> back<00:02:31.590> over

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the of the platform if we come back over

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.330 
the of the platform if we come back over
to<00:02:32.480> selecting<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.510> group<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.920> definitely

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
to selecting the group we definitely

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
to selecting the group we definitely
want<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.580> lock<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.000> orientation<00:02:36.450> down

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
want to lock this orientation down

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
want to lock this orientation down
because<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.590> over<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> tray

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
because if we go over to the tray

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.790 
because if we go over to the tray
settings<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.940> start<00:02:39.090> our<00:02:39.570> placement<00:02:40.260> it's

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
settings and start our placement it's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.760 
settings and start our placement it's
gonna<00:02:40.950> change<00:02:41.040> our<00:02:41.550> orientation<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.650> we

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
gonna change our orientation so if we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.230 
gonna change our orientation so if we
check<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.100> placement<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.650> invalidate<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.940> my

that<00:02:51.690> should<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.930> okay<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that should be okay with this and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.199 
that should be okay with this and
because<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.860> know<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> STL<00:02:53.700> files<00:02:53.940> are

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.979 
because I know that the STL files are
okay<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.010> also<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.430> an<00:02:56.520> estimate<00:02:56.989> and

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
okay and we can also do an estimate and

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.820 
okay and we can also do an estimate and
they'll<00:02:58.140> tell<00:02:58.410> us<00:02:58.440> that<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.410> digital
