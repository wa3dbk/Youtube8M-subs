so basically what we're going to work on

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.589 
so basically what we're going to work on
is<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.250> library<00:00:29.640> module<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.449> we

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
is really in the library module when we

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.830 
is really in the library module when we
go<00:00:30.840> ahead<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.560> were<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.710> import<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.660> up

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
handling option it says build previews

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040 
handling option it says build previews
and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> says<00:00:41.010> minimal<00:00:41.579> embedded<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.420> sidecar

under<00:02:04.829> build<00:02:05.070> previews<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:07.069> with<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> said

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
under build previews now with that said

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.850 
under build previews now with that said
that's<00:02:09.119> sort<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.379> talking<00:02:10.800> about

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that's sort of what we're talking about

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's sort of what we're talking about
okay<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.750> flip

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
okay so you can see if I flip

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
okay so you can see if I flip
you<00:02:13.680> see<00:02:13.860> houses<00:02:13.980> loading<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.840> of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you see houses loading here a lot of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800 
you see houses loading here a lot of
times<00:02:15.960> you'll<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:17.040> not<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:18.480> takes<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
times you'll see it's not a it takes a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.500 
times you'll see it's not a it takes a
while<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.380> full<00:02:19.710> resolution<00:02:19.980> photo<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
while for the full resolution photo to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.540 
while for the full resolution photo to
sort<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.810> pop<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.040> look<00:02:23.400> how

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
sort of pop up just like that look how

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.390 
sort of pop up just like that look how
long<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.790> took<00:02:24.060> me<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.980> in

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
long it took me when I if I go in

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 
long it took me when I if I go in
somewhere<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.780> loading<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:28.590> let's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
somewhere and it's loading and now let's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
somewhere and it's loading and now let's
say<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.070> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> zoom<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.730> look<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.630> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
say I want to zoom in look it's going to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.090 
say I want to zoom in look it's going to
take<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> while<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.440> rendering<00:02:31.920> rendering

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
take a while it's rendering rendering

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.550 
take a while it's rendering rendering
and<00:02:32.460> then<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> comes<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.050> right<00:02:34.290> there

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and then it comes in so that right there

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.460 
and then it comes in so that right there
is<00:02:34.740> what<00:02:35.070> build<00:02:35.760> previews<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.840> option

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
is what build previews that option

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.220 
is what build previews that option
really<00:02:37.770> has<00:02:38.070> an<00:02:38.250> effect<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.750> took<00:02:40.050> me<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
really has an effect on now it took me a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.170 
really has an effect on now it took me a
little<00:02:40.380> while<00:02:40.530> when<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> zoomed<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
little while when I zoomed in for it to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.670 
little while when I zoomed in for it to
come<00:02:42.420> up<00:02:42.540> because<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.110> always<00:02:43.740> I'm<00:02:44.610> sort<00:02:45.000> of

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
come up because I always I'm sort of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.290 
come up because I always I'm sort of
impatient<00:02:46.680> sometimes<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> usually

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
impatient sometimes so I usually

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.020 
impatient sometimes so I usually
actually<00:02:48.770> import<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.040> photos<00:02:50.460> by<00:02:50.820> only

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually import in my photos by only

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.900 
actually import in my photos by only
building<00:02:51.510> minimal<00:02:52.260> minimal<00:02:52.830> previews<00:02:53.400> that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
building minimal minimal previews that's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.500 
building minimal minimal previews that's
actually<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.220> quickest<00:02:56.220> import<00:02:57.000> method<00:02:57.180> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
actually the quickest import method that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.120 
actually the quickest import method that
you<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:58.370> so<00:03:00.200> what<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.350> means<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.860> there's

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
you can do so what that means is there's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.550 
you can do so what that means is there's
four<00:03:02.490> options<00:03:03.210> in<00:03:03.360> total<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.080> minimal

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
four options in total there is minimal

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.280 
four options in total there is minimal
so<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:05.760> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.030> explain<00:03:06.480> them<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so I'm going to explain them to you in a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.200 
so I'm going to explain them to you in a
list<00:03:07.590> format<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.700> going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> go<00:03:09.060> with

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
list format and it's going to go with

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.290 
list format and it's going to go with
the<00:03:09.330> quickest<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.020> import<00:03:10.550> but<00:03:11.550> then<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
the quickest to import but then the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.930 
the quickest to import but then the
longest<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.920> go<00:03:14.280> ahead<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.550> show<00:03:14.730> your

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
longest to go ahead and show your

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.780 
longest to go ahead and show your
preview<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.600> okay<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.650> minimal<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.580> give

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
preview here okay so minimal will give

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.090 
preview here okay so minimal will give
you<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> quickest<00:03:18.450> import<00:03:18.959> speed<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.830> sort

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
you the quickest import speed but sort

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.180 
you the quickest import speed but sort
of<00:03:20.220> give<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> longest<00:03:21.150> lag<00:03:21.570> time<00:03:21.870> on

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
of give you the longest lag time on

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.800 
of give you the longest lag time on
switching<00:03:23.190> from<00:03:23.370> picture<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.940> picture<00:03:24.090> or

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
switching from picture to picture or

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.310 
switching from picture to picture or
zooming<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.860> for<00:03:26.400> rendering<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.840> number<00:03:28.020> two

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
zooming in for rendering then number two

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.910 
zooming in for rendering then number two
is<00:03:28.350> embedded<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.520> sidecar<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:31.200> number<00:03:31.530> three

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
is embedded and sidecar the number three

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.390 
is embedded and sidecar the number three
will<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.430> standard<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.270> standard<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:34.400> will

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
will be standard so standard is will

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.949 
will be standard so standard is will
take<00:03:35.580> longer<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.150> import<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.720> it'll<00:03:36.840> be

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
take longer to import but it'll be

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.860 
take longer to import but it'll be
quicker<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:37.590> you're<00:03:37.740> just<00:03:37.920> doing<00:03:38.070> like<00:03:38.280> quick

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
quicker if you're just doing like quick

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.900 
quicker if you're just doing like quick
if<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.500> aren't<00:03:40.680> sumit<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.160> full<00:03:41.370> one<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.730> one

if you aren't sumit in a full one to one
if<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.270> doing<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:43.230> know<00:03:43.350> fill<00:03:43.920> fill<00:03:44.760> the

if you're doing you know fill fill the
frame<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.040> takes<00:03:47.250> the

frame and then the one that takes the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.570 
for every single image so what that
means<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.750> takes<00:04:10.260> super<00:04:10.950> super<00:04:11.250> super

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
means is it takes super super super

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.780 
means is it takes super super super
super<00:04:11.610> long<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:13.410> actually<00:04:13.650> import<00:04:14.489> into

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
super long to actually import into

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.979 
super long to actually import into
lightroom<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.140> if<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:17.480> if<00:04:18.480> you're<00:04:18.690> zooming

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
lightroom but if you if you're zooming

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.840 
lightroom but if you if you're zooming
in<00:04:19.140> you're<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.680> minimize<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.609> lag

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
in you're going to minimize that lag

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.170 
in you're going to minimize that lag
time<00:04:21.150> right<00:04:21.330> there<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:23.490> know<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
time right there so you know in a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.290 
time right there so you know in a
nutshell<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.870> really

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
nutshell it's really

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.330 
nutshell it's really
becomes<00:04:26.840> confusing<00:04:27.440> until<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.830> know<00:04:28.009> what

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
becomes confusing until you know what

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.680 
becomes confusing until you know what
it's<00:04:28.639> doing<00:04:29.449> but<00:04:29.629> once<00:04:30.409> you<00:04:30.590> know<00:04:30.620> sort<00:04:31.129> of<00:04:31.690> you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
it's doing but once you know sort of you

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.399 
it's doing but once you know sort of you
know<00:04:32.720> what<00:04:33.259> these<00:04:33.470> four<00:04:33.680> options<00:04:33.860> sort<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:35.409> you

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
know what these four options sort of you

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.260 
know what these four options sort of you
know<00:04:36.470> how<00:04:36.889> they<00:04:37.129> affect<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.669> it's<00:04:37.940> actually

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
know how they affect you it's actually

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.830 
know how they affect you it's actually
not<00:04:38.539> hard<00:04:38.810> at<00:04:38.900> all<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.190> know<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:41.210> what

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
not hard at all so you know if you what

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.180 
not hard at all so you know if you what
works<00:04:42.020> best<00:04:42.319> for<00:04:42.500> most<00:04:42.620> people<00:04:42.949> is<00:04:43.039> you're

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
works best for most people is you're

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.369 
works best for most people is you're
either<00:04:43.280> doing<00:04:43.580> minimal<00:04:44.030> or<00:04:44.479> you're<00:04:44.659> doing<00:04:45.050> one

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
either doing minimal or you're doing one

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.920 
either doing minimal or you're doing one
to<00:04:45.530> one<00:04:45.740> if<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.909> really<00:04:47.509> that<00:04:47.599> depends<00:04:47.900> on

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
to one if and really that depends on

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.839 
to one if and really that depends on
your<00:04:48.080> workflow<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:48.680> like<00:04:48.889> if<00:04:49.099> you<00:04:49.639> were

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
your workflow but like if you were

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.640 
your workflow but like if you were
someone<00:04:50.419> who<00:04:50.569> likes<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.960> zoom<00:04:51.199> in<00:04:51.349> like<00:04:51.500> on

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
someone who likes to zoom in like on

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.320 
someone who likes to zoom in like on
every<00:04:51.830> single<00:04:52.220> photo<00:04:52.580> you're<00:04:52.909> just<00:04:53.120> doing<00:04:53.300> a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
every single photo you're just doing a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.850 
every single photo you're just doing a
lot<00:04:53.539> of<00:04:53.569> fine-tuning<00:04:54.440> you're<00:04:54.650> doing

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
lot of fine-tuning you're doing

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.339 
lot of fine-tuning you're doing
touch-ups<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.699> know<00:04:55.819> you're<00:04:56.180> fixing<00:04:56.780> your

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
touch-ups you know you're fixing your

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.070 
touch-ups you know you're fixing your
cloning<00:04:57.680> you're<00:04:58.009> doing<00:04:58.159> all<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.430> then<00:04:59.080> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
cloning you're doing all that then you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080 
cloning you're doing all that then you
know<00:05:00.169> one<00:05:00.379> to<00:05:00.500> one<00:05:00.680> build<00:05:01.370> previews<00:05:01.849> may<00:05:02.030> be

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
know one to one build previews may be

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.430 
know one to one build previews may be
your<00:05:02.270> best<00:05:02.419> bet<00:05:02.690> because<00:05:02.930> that's<00:05:03.229> going<00:05:03.379> to

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
your best bet because that's going to

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.080 
your best bet because that's going to

save you time on the back end when

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.779 
save you time on the back end when
you're<00:05:05.210> actually<00:05:05.449> editing<00:05:05.870> if<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.889> are<00:05:07.310> like
