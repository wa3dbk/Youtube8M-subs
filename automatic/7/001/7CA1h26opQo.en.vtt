00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi to all the guys here we act with 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 a new video 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I decided not to upload hunger 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.509
 games or minecraft but I decided 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.950
 to upload a video tutorial for whom 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 like me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.609
 at first he did not know how to deal with 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 this problem is that then I solved 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 via sony vegas the problem of which there is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.150
 I speak are the annoying black edges 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 which for some could be 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 insignificant but annoying to me 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.210
 these black borders I started at 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 find above all began to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 record with fraps and came to me 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.469
 small black villages above is here 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 below and I could n't solve this 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.730
 no problem I tried with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.129
 cantafia and let's say it 's still gone 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 worse so I don't recommend 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.559
 use camtasia and finally find 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 the solution with sony vegas 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 now this obviously should 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 work with all the sounds it deserves 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 so all 11 will work with 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.670
 whatever version you have now 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 let's get our video that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.580
 for example this one 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 and here we see now we are there are 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.720
 very thin black edges that in any case 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.080
 videos will be seen if you upload it to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.030
 youtube is not that we don't see ourselves now 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.509
 enough to remove these bordin and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.439
 just click with the right on the 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:31.740
 on the video part of this of this 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.420
 let's say this project we click the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.040
 right click on the video part not on 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.960
 audio part because it would be one thing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 totally different but on the part 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 video 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 we go on our own tease and take away the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.930
 spunta ama intention waits radio radio ok 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.079
 once done this we press ok and le 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 beautiful air balls and black borders will be 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.290
 disappeared we say we will be removed 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.110
 automatically without doing 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.150
 no strange thing and therefore not there 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.120
 will remain that render by going on 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.930
 will render and then select the template 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.390
 which we love for this episode is 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.350
 ie everything for this video tutorial is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.870
 all 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.280
 I hope I have been useful to you with 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.410
 this short thing because it could 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 precisely to serve those who began a 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.580
 do video recently and don't know how 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.160
 eliminate these black edges 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 nothing for this tutorial and everything in me 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.170
 greeting and see you in a future video
