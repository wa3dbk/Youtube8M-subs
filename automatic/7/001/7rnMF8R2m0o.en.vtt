00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
one is too dark what I would really

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.639 
one is too dark what I would really
wanted<00:02:00.289> was<00:02:00.939> one<00:02:01.939> in<00:02:02.270> between<00:02:02.750> these<00:02:03.049> two<00:02:03.380> but

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
wanted was one in between these two but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.580 
wanted was one in between these two but
you<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.979> see<00:02:04.280> how<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.350> know<00:02:06.439> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
you can see how that do you know the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.460 
you can see how that do you know the
lighter<00:02:06.829> complexion<00:02:07.189> really<00:02:08.000> does<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:09.319> know

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
lighter complexion really does you know

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.979 
lighter complexion really does you know
it<00:02:09.649> looks<00:02:09.679> wrong<00:02:10.390> definitely<00:02:11.390> looks<00:02:11.599> more

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
it looks wrong definitely looks more

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.650 
it looks wrong definitely looks more
like<00:02:12.260> Manny<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> dark<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.180> complexion

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
like Manny with the dark of complexion

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.440 
like Manny with the dark of complexion
or<00:02:14.959> anything<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.519> still<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:17.300> it's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
or anything and but I still think it's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.479 
or anything and but I still think it's
too<00:02:17.540> dark<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.110> could<00:02:18.319> do<00:02:18.590> one<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.099> between

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
too dark that could do one in between

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.670 
too dark that could do one in between
the<00:02:19.700> two<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> had<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.720> go<00:02:20.959> with<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> dark<00:02:21.470> on

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
the two so I had to go with the dark on

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.910 
the two so I had to go with the dark on
