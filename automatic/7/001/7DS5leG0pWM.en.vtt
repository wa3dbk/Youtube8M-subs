highlighted<00:02:09.649> right<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.099> your<00:02:10.220> menu<00:02:10.489> screens<00:02:10.819> I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
highlighted right on your menu screens I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.369 
highlighted right on your menu screens I
think<00:02:11.269> left<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.569> there's<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> whole<00:02:11.989> new<00:02:12.140> level

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
think left is there's a whole new level

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.750 
think left is there's a whole new level
of<00:02:12.470> authenticity<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.580> get

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
of authenticity because you kind of get

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.220 
of authenticity because you kind of get
fresh<00:02:14.060> data<00:02:14.269> week<00:02:14.510> by<00:02:14.660> week<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.080> game

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
fresh data week by week and the game

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.600 
fresh data week by week and the game
plays<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.410> little<00:02:15.680> different<00:02:16.010> week<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.220> week<00:02:16.370> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
plays a little different week a week and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.030 
plays a little different week a week and
that<00:02:16.879> for<00:02:17.090> us<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.390> perhaps<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.989> most<00:02:18.040> exciting

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
