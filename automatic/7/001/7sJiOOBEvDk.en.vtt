for<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.569> next<00:04:42.629> packing<00:04:43.199> so<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.580> may<00:04:44.699> have<00:04:44.849> one

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 
for the next packing so you may have one

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:46.429 
for the next packing so you may have one
student<00:04:45.240> who's<00:04:45.569> still<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:45.990> straight<00:04:46.259> back

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
student who's still on a straight back

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.969 
student who's still on a straight back
or<00:04:46.770> on<00:04:47.279> parallel<00:04:47.639> but<00:04:48.360> they'll<00:04:48.569> have<00:04:48.800> they<00:04:49.800> had

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
or on parallel but they'll have they had

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.860 
or on parallel but they'll have they had
six<00:04:50.490> curl<00:04:50.699> trucks<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.240> were<00:04:51.330> available<00:04:51.509> for

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
six curl trucks that were available for

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.239 
six curl trucks that were available for
the<00:04:51.930> training<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:52.529> I<00:04:52.560> thought<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.159> was

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:53.249 
the training so I thought that was

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.209 
the training so I thought that was
pretty<00:04:53.340> cool<00:04:53.520> too

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:55.219 
pretty cool too

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.589 
pretty cool too
so<00:04:56.219> if<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.610> group<00:04:56.729> of<00:04:56.909> students<00:04:57.210> are<00:04:57.330> ready<00:04:57.509> for

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
so if a group of students are ready for

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.320 
so if a group of students are ready for
the<00:04:58.259> 90<00:04:58.620> on<00:04:58.770> Wednesday<00:04:58.800> they're<00:04:59.610> showing<00:05:00.180> them

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
the 90 on Wednesday they're showing them

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.450 
the 90 on Wednesday they're showing them
the<00:05:00.509> 90<00:05:00.810> on<00:05:00.930> Wednesday<00:05:01.349> and<00:05:01.590> they<00:05:02.009> can<00:05:02.159> keep<00:05:02.310> on

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the 90 on Wednesday and they can keep on

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.399

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
practicing throughout all the skills so

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.990 
practicing throughout all the skills so
they<00:05:04.590> don't<00:05:04.770> really<00:05:05.069> hold<00:05:05.279> any<00:05:05.520> bag<00:05:05.729> from

East<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.699> got<00:05:35.939> to<00:05:36.089> drive<00:05:36.419> around<00:05:36.860> North

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
East so I got to drive around North

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.990

that's<00:05:44.129> where<00:05:44.279> I<00:05:44.339> actually<00:05:44.460> learned<00:05:44.819> how<00:05:44.969> to

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
that's where I actually learned how to

that's where I actually learned how to
drive<00:05:45.330> at<00:05:45.569> so<00:05:46.139> my<00:05:46.439> confidence<00:05:46.649> behind<00:05:47.159> traffic

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.399 
drive at so my confidence behind traffic

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.029 
drive at so my confidence behind traffic
behind<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.389> wheel<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.659> a<00:05:48.719> truck<00:05:48.870> was<00:05:49.229> fairly

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
behind the wheel of a truck was fairly

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.219 
behind the wheel of a truck was fairly
high<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.699> I<00:05:51.000> was<00:05:51.149> able<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.389> be<00:05:51.810> confident

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
high and I was able to be confident

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.189 
high and I was able to be confident
whenever<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.589> was<00:05:52.710> going<00:05:52.860> through<00:05:52.949> training<00:05:54.199> so

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
whenever I was going through training so

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.540
