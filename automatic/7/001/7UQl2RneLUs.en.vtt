00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.510
 or the healthy part very well very happy 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.420
 with the crafts that we are going to make today 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.000
 today what we are going to do is a quarry 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.910
 I know we already made a portfolio 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.010
 many videos a long time ago we did 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.350
 a portfolio but make a medium video 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.690
 average old man with different quality 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 habits then I want to make a 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.610
 new portfolio that is different from the one 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.040
 we did in the other video that if they want 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 I leave it to you so you can see it 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.180
 here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.510
 let's make a portfolio a little bit more 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.970
 the most beautiful professional so I hope 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.790
 that they like that they start doing it is 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.760
 super easy farther we can the 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.520
 lose because it's very rewarding to think 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.979
 that what we have put we did 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.799
 us ourselves so I hope that they 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 like more brakes and let's do it not 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 we lose more time 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.020
 in a piece of cloth we are going to mark a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.120
 rectangle the size that you 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 want the portfolio to mark on fabric 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.820
 what I use is an old soap and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.570
 that's much better to mark and it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.970
 erase easy now let's dial with the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.480
 same measure of that other rectangle 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.730
 same but this one we're going to add the 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.250
 double the size 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.670
 then we are going to stay like that size 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 what's left is to make a cover for 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.280
 do the sides we will need the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.530
 same measure of height as the front and 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.890
 the width that you wish I will 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.430
 do 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 finite we're going to need to do 21 for 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.620
 each side first we are going to sew one 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.620
 with the front side we have to 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.080
 face one fabric with the other and there 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.890
 pass the machine or if you can not also 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.890
 do it by hand 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.580
 and then we do the same procedure 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 with the other side 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.620
 now we have to sew the sides 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.780
 but with the back of the portfolio 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.900
 We are going to sew in the same way as with 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.480
 the front but leaving the part of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.090
 We always pay attention to the fact that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.700
 we were all on the reverse side of sewing 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.579
 always the wrong side and then it is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.730
 turn now let's make the base of the 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.920
 portfolio for that we need to make a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.319
 rectangle has to have the same 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.079
 measure of the length of the front part 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.569
 of the portfolio and the sides and for 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.209
 sewing it is very easy we start with the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.609
 part of forward we face it as 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.159
 we did with the sides and then alone 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.010
 we will be leaving the form to each 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.470
 we're going to frown a little bit on 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.209
 the top part and there we sew it a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.879
 little bit so that we have more 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 We will sew the formality in the lid 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.049
 another fabric we're just going to sew the three 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.109
 sides 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.580
 - the top part the closure we're going 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.980
 to know with here 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.770
 At each turn the closure we put mouth 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.530
 below and we sew one side of the closure 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.870
 with one side of the portfolio and the other with 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.360
 the other side now to give you a detail 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.360
 cited what I want to do is put a 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.810
 pocket also a closure on the part 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.450
 from the top for that I had to measure from 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.450
 how much do I want my pocket to be and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.820
 cut that line and now to place the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.380
 close let's do the same thing that 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.380
 we did previously 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.340
 now we sew the part of the lid that 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.340
 we were left without sewing 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.550
 now we only have the strap and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.590
 that use chain is very beautiful and 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.360
 very professional I love how 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.090
 the chains are left only what we have 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.060
 What to do is put one of the links 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.580
 on the side we passed the needle 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.740
 from inside the portfolio and just 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.720
 where the link of the chain passes 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.760
 we give him enough stitches until 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.890
 see that it is firm 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.890
 and we do the same with the other side 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.330
 and have healthy tea and we have made a 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.330
 Super nice and super professional wallet 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.070
 yes 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.240
 ah 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.030
 good to death breasts I hope you have them 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.490
 liked today's video was very nice 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.010
 this race to me I really loved it 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.960
 now I take them everywhere I needed 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.660
 make a portfolio so I said why 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.370
 they do not make a portfolio for this video and 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.380
 Also craftsmen also learn 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.940
 good as you know if they liked the 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.460
 Video can be clicked on the button 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.500
 I like it also in those that are not 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.020
 Subscribers can subscribe to the 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.330
