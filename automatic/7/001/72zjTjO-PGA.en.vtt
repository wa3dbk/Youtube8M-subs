00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
performance from there at times they had

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
performance from there at times they had
us<00:01:39.780> hand<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.070> were<00:01:41.310> bullying

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640

after<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.530> scored<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.950> well<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.579> thought

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
after they scored as well and I thought

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.740 
after they scored as well and I thought
they<00:01:44.850> were<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> come<00:01:45.210> back<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
they were going to come back into it and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
they were going to come back into it and
take<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> lead<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.770> stage<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the sense that we got the result but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
the sense that we got the result but
really<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.090> another<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.659> games

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
really it was another one of those games

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.450 
really it was another one of those games
where<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.469> managed<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> pick<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> points

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
where we managed to pick up the points

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
where we managed to pick up the points
without<00:01:59.579> ever<00:01:59.880> playing<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.170> who

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
without ever playing that well but who

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
without ever playing that well but who
really<00:02:01.500> cares<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.700> looks<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:02.969> we've

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
really cares because it looks like we've

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
really cares because it looks like we've
got<00:02:03.360> Champions<00:02:03.869> League<00:02:03.990> football<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
got Champions League football now the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
got Champions League football now the
onus<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.460> Liverpool<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.540> there

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
onus is on Liverpool now to go out there

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.150 
onus is on Liverpool now to go out there
and<00:02:06.810> beat<00:02:07.020> Chelsea<00:02:07.469> will<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.710> some<00:02:07.920> sort<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and beat Chelsea will get some sort of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619 
and beat Chelsea will get some sort of
result<00:02:08.369> against<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.119> need<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> win

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
result against them they need to win

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.420 
result against them they need to win
really<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.379> Chelsea<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.310> too

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
really I think Chelsea going to be too

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.510 
really I think Chelsea going to be too
strong<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> other

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
strong for them the other

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.150 
strong for them the other
the<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.180> champions<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> reason<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.010> at

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the the champions for a reason and at

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.350 
the the champions for a reason and at
Stamford<00:02:15.550> Bridge<00:02:15.580> they<00:02:15.940> don't<00:02:16.150> seem<00:02:16.330> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
Stamford Bridge they don't seem to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.910 
Stamford Bridge they don't seem to
really<00:02:16.510> give<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.260> much<00:02:17.470> away<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:17.770> it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
really give that that much away so it's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.080 
really give that that much away so it's
going<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.070> be<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> tough<00:02:18.400> game<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.640> Liverpool

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
going to be a tough game for Liverpool

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.700 
going to be a tough game for Liverpool
today<00:02:19.810> though<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.050> mean<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.410> terms<00:02:20.560> of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
today though I mean in terms of

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.680 
today though I mean in terms of
performances<00:02:21.220> out<00:02:21.400> there<00:02:21.640> nobody's<00:02:22.510> really

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
performances out there nobody's really

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330 
performances out there nobody's really
shown<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.170> greatly<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.650> think<00:02:23.920> killer<00:02:24.070> daily

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
shown that greatly I think killer daily

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.650 
shown that greatly I think killer daily
bins<00:02:24.610> been<00:02:24.820> pretty<00:02:25.060> hit-and-miss<00:02:25.240> throughout

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
bins been pretty hit-and-miss throughout

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.420 
bins been pretty hit-and-miss throughout
the<00:02:25.780> game<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.530> defensive<00:02:27.250> bears
