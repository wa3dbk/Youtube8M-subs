00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that also do sort of a decent range of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.709 
that also do sort of a decent range of
colours<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.629> bit

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
this is actually a little bit dark for

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.840 
this is actually a little bit dark for
me<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.910> shade<00:02:46.170> SB<00:02:47.170> 14<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.700> is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
me this is the shade SB 14 and this is

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.310 
me this is the shade SB 14 and this is
definitely<00:02:49.210> one<00:02:49.450> for<00:02:49.480> summer<00:02:49.810> months<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.200> me

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
so many shades that if you are sort of
darker<00:02:54.250> skinned<00:02:54.490> it's<00:02:54.910> fantastic<00:02:55.570> because

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
darker skinned it's fantastic because

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.380 
darker skinned it's fantastic because
you<00:02:55.840> could<00:02:56.020> choose<00:02:56.290> anything<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.220> yeah<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.300> i

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
said i didn't get matched up for this so

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.590 
said i didn't get matched up for this so
it's<00:02:59.950> slightly<00:03:00.250> dark<00:03:00.580> for<00:03:00.790> me<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:01.090> i<00:03:01.120> really

find that your skin kind of has the
habit<00:05:33.680> of<00:05:33.860> going<00:05:34.340> slightly<00:05:34.639> orangie<00:05:35.210> when<00:05:35.389> you

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
habit of going slightly orangie when you

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.850 
habit of going slightly orangie when you
put<00:05:35.690> foundation<00:05:35.870> on<00:05:36.169> it's<00:05:36.410> been<00:05:36.530> on<00:05:36.650> for<00:05:36.680> a

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
put foundation on it's been on for a

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.490 
put foundation on it's been on for a
while<00:05:37.039> maybe<00:05:37.760> go<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.419> shade<00:05:38.720> down<00:05:38.990> on<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.289> one

while maybe go a shade down on this one

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.230 
while maybe go a shade down on this one
I'm<00:05:39.650> kind<00:05:39.919> of<00:05:40.099> thinking<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.639> maybe<00:05:40.880> should<00:05:41.210> have

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
I'm kind of thinking I maybe should have

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.520 
I'm kind of thinking I maybe should have
done<00:05:41.449> that<00:05:41.599> because<00:05:41.750> I'll<00:05:42.020> wear<00:05:42.199> this<00:05:42.349> for

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
done that because I'll wear this for

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.960 
done that because I'll wear this for
about<00:05:42.620> half<00:05:43.039> an<00:05:43.190> hour<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.550> then<00:05:43.669> I'll<00:05:43.760> start

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
about half an hour and then I'll start

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.939 
about half an hour and then I'll start
to<00:05:44.090> realise<00:05:44.419> that<00:05:44.990> it's<00:05:45.169> starting<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.560> look

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
to realise that it's starting to look

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.560 
to realise that it's starting to look
slightly<00:05:46.220> oranjee<00:05:46.789> which<00:05:46.909> i<00:05:47.060> think<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.360> often

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
slightly oranjee which i think is often

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.240 
slightly oranjee which i think is often
in<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.840> nature<00:05:48.139> drugstore<00:05:48.590> foundations<00:05:49.070> but

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250
