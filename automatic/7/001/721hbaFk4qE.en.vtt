 have melted at 50 ° the ass of hen 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.629

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:46.500
 degrees valves is here movements in 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 form of 8 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.530

 we will now mount the dough a 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.390
 bond until cooling 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.280
 Simultaneously we will return the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.280

 the unctuous we have here other 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:00.060
 chocolate at 50 ° the dough abound and the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.530
 cream teeming not too tight we
