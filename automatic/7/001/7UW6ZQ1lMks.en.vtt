00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:04.479
 there 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.059
 juju but well I spent 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.570
 julien escande more than 20 years could therefore it's not very very ears 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 three colors of the moment for me it was the departure will be at 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.730
 lookout 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.050
 q castres an engine for a concept the next 20 june days a little bit so 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.330
 on the inner plane of the whitish kunar 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.359
 family of even some exceptions 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.899
 roland i believe that 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.749
 1 since two years of competition can actually I have three next 

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.690
 seasons for the hospitals treated had actually been the winters 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.700
 are a little long speeches 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.610
 but if we take pleasure in the field and in the work I think it 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.050
 passes over 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 but withdrawal is a team work training at the site 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 but rugby is a sport that is sport and do not have access to a 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.370
 undergrowth what we can 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.540
 we can not escape so we need colleagues we can actually 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.900
 all intervals are directed from the preparation elsewhere to work on 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.699
 goes on team cohesion must and all the other cars of yesterday the young 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.460
 have registered 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 and I think that he will not necessarily see those who often possess 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.790
 as the casino does in an efficient way, its recipes are that this 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.050
 cohesion and solidarity that moved from asking what 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.550
 so tell us a little about the role of each person around you for 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.870
 training for physical preparation 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.090
 three days for now what is rather rather very well organized 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.770
 rather very competent 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.170
 further complementary 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.890
 in the warehouse grape shot with olive tree olive tree yesterday who cares more 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 especially to a goal of the game of three quarters 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 with% including everything related to the foot day relationship so these 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.210
 some lines of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.130
 what experience first of all someone very competent man in a hurry 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 so picky so very nice working with him 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.010
 after the hands of two physical trainers is little baidoa 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.030
 where can ollier who are also there 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.720
 still of the world 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 paris bic other size problem that are quite complementary 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.049
 also addressed the subject the boss of the physical preparation so hubert 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.460
 this coming back with him rather focused on everything related to reactivation 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.380
 of the player including the injured player's brochu because we put him back on the road 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.369
 the start up that followed at dinner 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.089
 so that's all that would be good 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.640
 the field staff that is pretty rare enough enough 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.909
 this operator a coup d'état and then especially I work a lot 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.010
 bh suntour the staff we go so everything is logistics tribute to quicktime 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.659
 who we with tobacco stays with us so normally dad with the congo 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.629
 can for example handle same as ours rare to that news 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.569
 recruits will compensate the departures 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.849
 but I do not have to wait too long to know 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.450
 a few games on the clock I think that after the first so we will not see 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.540
 lighter in the sand that I do not want a europe 1 no because we in them 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.629
 costs at least that the players who leave by not against the quality I 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.700
 always want to see more closely it's solar that are players who have 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.389
 most need more evidence those who know it today proud of his life 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.570
 today other teams% to more vegetable garden than his last 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.330
 field 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.030
 after you have to watch the game to start with the one aurillac had 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.369
 produce a little lighter 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.389
 to train a team precisely it takes character and that you have 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.330
 here it seems I can character sometimes not easy to live 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.560
 but you know we go to the trap 35 mm which have bigger and bigger 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.569
 national characters in paca when we get eaten what 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.649
 but I'm not used to moalla of injury 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:23.449
 let us walk on it so actually sometimes it sometimes has 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.759
 ideas those sometimes that's sacred about 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.359
 we are still on a report of paul pierce loyal report in all this the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.839
 most important 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.979
 a motto at a stop-gain romanian music in europe within the team of 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.169
 gruissan 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.169
 here I think the picture showing a 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.489
 here is cisse instead of a show that 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.159
 that these beers peddle it all over the last year especially 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.430
 the final stages, although they were slightly fewer than the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.409
 albigeois or 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.919
 all the agents obviously dai bingguo there is to know I speak this is 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.069
 went to the picture and the supporters is taking a little more room 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.179
 a coat of water water 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:05.499
 thales ba the image of rugby pro 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.969
 exactly what are your relations with the supporters rihanna ciara and the 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.689
 emanations of the same 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.609
 ball judith today sand part where I am yielded the summer I am pretty 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.909
 well and in the opinion of every day 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.949
 paget already meeting a very different little show has already had to yield to 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.309
 fear what 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.659
 if I had to make a comparison to follow him again a lot arms and 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.529
 very quickly but to do them or not all the time 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.709
 here it is difficult to judge by the course of a single draft at ten years 

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:34.009
 to be able to do it immediately a strong friendship so today I have a lot 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.949
 no more relationship to lions 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.870
 basically for them I can still do it 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.740
 the program but it's like that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
 to conclude how do you see the season getting ready 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.050
 bako player has got stuck in a difficult season I'm split 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.839
 between the fact that this is what makes things difficult because we will be 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.699
 tense because renewing what we did nuance it will be a real 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.169
 exploit baba lothar matthaüs moldavia 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.319
 precisely of enthusiasm are especially open the shop 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.319
 see the text and the debate is now assured that 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.009
 in the past mages preparation for training and preparation 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.279
 tomorrow% we were satisfied with gold today I'm looking forward to a quota 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.439
 attacked the seamen georgette barrow named% with hello the the potential of 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.730
 this team that comes out the players who are not playing with you 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.639
 how are they morally prepared 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.009
 runaway season compared to what we experienced this help 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.009
 doubt to find to find the guys a little more than a speaker 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.399
 poutine a field because it took a lot given the assault of a particular 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.389
 on the end of the season guys have a lot of water in a net 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.729
 completely failed 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.729
 especially mentally improved since manu at the movies 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.880
 the team that I had hoped in vain to find this man walks from this 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.259
 start this major damage a little bit more 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.889
 he is mentally an animal to question the evil to follow 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:53.939
 troupe job 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.539
 and a fret I do not know at all what happened and I think we're on 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.969
 a two-wheeler for being granted to Morocco a little later than 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.829
 the others have made us many duels the Girondins have found the 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.449
 news group corp we had left his local newspapers especially on the on the 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.989
 end of season seine-high dynamics of his men and I'm 

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.559
 in groupama times very 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.430
 very close very close to enthusiasm 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.039
 erdf is driven which gives a lot 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.530
 So here I love you corruption do not change the state of mind we will know 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.120
 always a difficult team to play by positioning themselves 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.270
 you must not change your mind 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.470
 thank you christophe gazel good season novelli
