00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.330
 friends ie vernex in well-found on 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.190
 Our YouTube channel is Riva 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.990
 paparella and I'm mauro fabbri hello a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.099
 everyone today wanted to offer you a kind 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.710
 review extension 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.239
 the acate voices the smartwatch at home 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.650
 catel because we have already done one 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.509
 decision quite articulated but 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.279
 this is one of the few capable products 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.829
 to run on the two platforms more 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.979
 spread on android and ios then 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.140
 today we take the opportunity of the 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:34.330
 of the iphone 6 of mauro that is using 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.130
 of the first devices and averages are a 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.110
 a great admirer of a life of form 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.270
 and inaccurate so let's see 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.640
 deepen the speeches of the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.800
 applications installed on the iPhone 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 then basically as he says 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.370
 rightly ivan the role of alcatel e 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.860
 very simple but functional tool 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.980
 versatile and offers virtually all 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.570
 information one wishes from one 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.670
 smartphone shot the interface a lot 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.189
 cute colorful now let's go see 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.979
 laplug has basically been adapted 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:14.229
 for the apple ios operating system a 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.630
 an initial quad dacha where we 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.399
 we can find summaries and 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 main information on 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.189
 performance of the training that we 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.009
 we hold during our day 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.950
 on physical activity on how far 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.100
 we traveled by walking or 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
 extra training the lap reminds us that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.729
 we have to measure ours from time to time 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.659
 heart rate because in fact how 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.479
 you can now see theirs already in his 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.840
 internal measurement system with 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.200
 rennet then that continuous simeto then 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.479
 just activate the interface now 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 the operation makes from 274 beats and a little 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.270
 agitated but you tell me they are all 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.840
 this information we go to 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.490
 find yourself in the main dashboard 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.390
 dedicated mainly to the activity 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.539
 physics 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.910
 then we have a chronology which is one 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.750
 sort of summary of all the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.620
 measurements that the sensors performed 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.319
 of the alcatel one touch watch 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.739
 then we have our interface where 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.200
 we can configure and customize 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.049
 both the appearance of the 40's watch 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.019
 of the clock the deadlines of 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.420
 sync between smartphone and 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.590
 smartwatch and then a whole series of 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.450
 other little interesting details like 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.890
 check if the app was a day 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.860
 setting goals can 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.019
 decide how much and how and the clock diverts 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.630
 and report if we are building a 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.600
 right workout rather than how many 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 calories we burned and so on 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.170
 finally we have an additional menu of 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.970
 configuration that allows us to 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.850
 indicate both the alarm bookseller 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.049
 then I in which the clock does not have to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.389
 accept reports and frequency e 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.340
 the type of notifications these are 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.440
 all the apps installed on my 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.920
 watch compatible smartphones 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.800
 we can flight care and decide of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.400
 activate more or less information 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.180
 perfect as you have seen united 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.670
 heard 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.920
 the application is well done well 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.030
 articulated very fluid monofunctional 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 stable and in two weeks and use has not 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.980
 never had crash lock issues and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.110
 not sync selected much 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.270
 interesting is the stability of the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.150
 sync I've tried others 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.280
 smartphones more or less compatible with 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.490
 apple and even loose platforms a 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.620
 sometimes give difficulties to 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.750
 connection of dialogue is never 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.520
 in fact I also verified when I have it 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.960
 tried in that case instead uses a 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.300
 android dumb device killers 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.770
 things feeling the thing you liked 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.420
 for me they love we found in 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.340
 parallel this smartphone is the fact 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.209
 which is a product that works well and 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.430
 round 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.520
 do essential but useful things during 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.860
 the day without looking for things 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.910
 it is objectively and useless that we find 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.650
 on other devices 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.570
 the nice thing is to have a 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.370
 system states that regarding it 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.440
 smartwatch in two homes well 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.510
 made both for us and for the world 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.419
 to us as you have seen way of ha 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.370
 explained the relative perfection 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.130
 functioning or with a very thing 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.890
 interesting that one is also on 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.800
 ion platform is if the alarm works 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.960
 of oneself as of distancing oneself 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.120
 watch from the phone so if we 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.930
 we are forgetting the smartphone from 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.870
 somewhere 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.790
 the clock lives and signals attention to us 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.430
 do not forget the phone if later 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.960
 we just can't find it we can 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.320
 send a signal and hilde phone 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.810
 be playing not find him 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.820
 we talk to feelings but the idea is that 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.920
 we gave more or less all that 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.690
 there was to tell about both the smart and the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.070
 if the frame application 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.200
 at this point I would say we can 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.240
 salutary work in the five months that we 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.010
 we find for pro silvio certainly from 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.010
 maura greet everyone
