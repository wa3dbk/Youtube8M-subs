made up of three pieces mainly because

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
made up of three pieces mainly because
we<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.460> cut<00:01:50.640> three<00:01:50.939> lengths<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.390> hung<00:01:51.540> them

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
we just cut three lengths and hung them

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.920 
we just cut three lengths and hung them
here<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.380> year<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.740> built<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> shed<00:01:53.930> if
