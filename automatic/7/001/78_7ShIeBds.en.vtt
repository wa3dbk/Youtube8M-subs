00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.580 
this guy right here you can have like
three<00:01:46.979> people<00:01:47.159> aiming<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.790> him<00:01:47.909> at<00:01:48.090> once

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
three people aiming at him at once

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.270 
three people aiming at him at once
and<00:01:49.590> he<00:01:49.680> probably<00:01:49.890> does<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> you've<00:01:53.250> just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

jumped<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.970> onto<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> object<00:01:54.930> again<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:56.250> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
jumped up onto the object again I'm just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.179 
jumped up onto the object again I'm just
kidding<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.380> stinker

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
kidding it's all good but I just stinker

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859 
kidding it's all good but I just stinker
stay<00:01:59.670> away<00:01:59.880> from<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.210> center<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.719> map

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
stay away from the center of the map

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.520 
stay away from the center of the map
kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.810> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> stay<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
kind of I like to kind of stay in the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.910 
kind of I like to kind of stay in the
edges<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> map<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.689> camp<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
edges of the map and camp in like I

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
edges of the map and camp in like I
don't<00:02:08.069> know<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.819> center<00:02:09.179> spot

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
don't know like in that center spot

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.850 
don't know like in that center spot
where<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.750> right<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.619> shot

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
where you are right now you can be shot

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
where you are right now you can be shot
at<00:02:11.039> literally<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.760> every<00:02:12.239> angle<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.020> that's

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
at literally from every angle so that's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.949 
at literally from every angle so that's
like<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.800> bad<00:02:13.920> part<00:02:14.690> another<00:02:15.690> tip<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
like a really bad part another tip that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.290 
like a really bad part another tip that
I<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.890> bring<00:02:17.160> two<00:02:17.400> snipers<00:02:17.640> because

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
I have is I bring two snipers because

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.479 
I have is I bring two snipers because
for<00:02:19.170> some<00:02:19.379> reason<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.069> feels<00:02:20.280> like

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
for some reason it just feels like

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.400 
for some reason it just feels like
you're<00:02:20.670> quick<00:02:20.940> switching<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> kind<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.080> slower

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
you're quick switching is kind of slower

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.869 
you're quick switching is kind of slower
than<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.800> would<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.310> didn't<00:02:23.640> quick

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
than it would be if you didn't quick

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.699 
than it would be if you didn't quick
switch<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.080> quick<00:02:25.290> switch<00:02:25.500> from

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
switch and if you quick switch from

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.500 
switch and if you quick switch from
sniper<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.220> sniper<00:02:26.459> that's<00:02:26.760> also<00:02:27.090> quicker<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
sniper to sniper that's also quicker I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.350 
sniper to sniper that's also quicker I
feel<00:02:27.840> than<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.379> knife<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.610> don't<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.849> it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
feel than a knife I just I don't know it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.930 
feel than a knife I just I don't know it
doesn't<00:02:30.629> like<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.739> understand<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.819> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
doesn't like I don't understand what the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.790 
doesn't like I don't understand what the
point<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.239> quick<00:02:33.480> switching<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:34.050> when<00:02:34.680> you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
point of quick switching is when you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.309 
point of quick switching is when you
have<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.489> one<00:02:36.150> sniper<00:02:36.420> unless<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
have like one sniper unless it's just

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.699 
have like one sniper unless it's just
for<00:02:37.620> show<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.430> feel<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.970> your<00:02:39.840> snipe<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
for show but I feel like your snipe it

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.170 
for show but I feel like your snipe it
like<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.069> doesn't<00:02:41.280> speed<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.760> your<00:02:41.910> sniper

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
like it doesn't speed up your sniper

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.199 
like it doesn't speed up your sniper
shots<00:02:42.569> at<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.400> only<00:02:44.670> benefits<00:02:45.090> are

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
shots at all and the only benefits are

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
shots at all and the only benefits are
quick<00:02:45.390> switching<00:02:45.629> really<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.410> opinion<00:02:46.440> is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
quick switching really in my opinion is

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.850 
quick switching really in my opinion is
when<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.300> second<00:02:48.690> sniper<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.290> then

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
when you have a second sniper and then

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860 
when you have a second sniper and then
you're<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.099> using<00:02:50.340> less<00:02:50.610> bullets<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.300> maybe

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you're just using less bullets and maybe

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.170 
you're just using less bullets and maybe
I<00:02:52.080> don't<00:02:52.170> know<00:02:52.470> if<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.040> shoots<00:02:53.310> faster<00:02:53.819> but

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
I don't know if it shoots faster but

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
I don't know if it shoots faster but
it's<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.750> feels<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> may<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.800> so

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it's just it feels like it may be so

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.369 
it's just it feels like it may be so
like<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> would<00:02:57.480> never<00:02:57.599> quick<00:02:57.900> switch<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
like but I would never quick switch if I

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.990 
like but I would never quick switch if I
only<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:58.890> sniper<00:02:59.129> unless<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.879> for

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
only have one sniper unless it's for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
only have one sniper unless it's for
like<00:03:00.150> an<00:03:00.300> edit<00:03:00.569> or<00:03:00.659> something<00:03:01.050> when<00:03:01.620> I'm<00:03:01.739> using

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
like an edit or something when I'm using

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.979 
like an edit or something when I'm using
like<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> tomahawk<00:03:02.610> or<00:03:03.330> something<00:03:03.629> like<00:03:03.750> that

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
like a tomahawk or something like that

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.050 
like a tomahawk or something like that
cuz<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.260> looks<00:03:04.590> cool<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.640> deal<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
cuz that looks cool or like the deal and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.850 
cuz that looks cool or like the deal and
stuff<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.720> guess<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.900> biggest<00:03:10.080> tip<00:03:10.379> so<00:03:10.620> far

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
stuff so I guess the biggest tip so far

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.100 
stuff so I guess the biggest tip so far
that<00:03:11.099> I've<00:03:11.190> seen<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.330> just<00:03:12.480> gotta<00:03:12.720> check

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
that I've seen is you just gotta check

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.690 
that I've seen is you just gotta check
behind<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.800> that's<00:03:14.099> your<00:03:14.340> biggest<00:03:14.550> problem

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
behind you that's your biggest problem

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.210 
behind you that's your biggest problem
or<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.629> necessarily<00:03:16.379> behind<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.129> you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
or not necessarily behind you but you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.910 
or not necessarily behind you but you
just<00:03:17.370> got<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.670> look<00:03:17.760> all<00:03:17.970> around<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.440> know

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
just got to look all around and know

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910 
just got to look all around and know
that<00:03:20.580> if<00:03:20.849> you're<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.659> an<00:03:21.810> open<00:03:21.930> spot<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.709> got<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that if you're in an open spot you got a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.949 
that if you're in an open spot you got a
run<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.489> always<00:03:24.209> do<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.510> whenever<00:03:24.690> I'm

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
run I always do this whenever I'm

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.720 
run I always do this whenever I'm
sniping<00:03:25.349> if<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.769> there's<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> whole<00:03:26.489> bunch<00:03:26.610> of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
sniping if I there's a whole bunch of
