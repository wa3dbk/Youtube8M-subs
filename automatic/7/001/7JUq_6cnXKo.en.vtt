00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.210
 naples that does not have the thickness 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.120
 and serve 471 series attendances without 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.400
 culture 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.120

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.649
 [Applause] 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.180

 [Applause] 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.140

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.000
 [Music] 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.200
