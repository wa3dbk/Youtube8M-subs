00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the four bolt set up the four bolt then

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.609 
the four bolt set up the four bolt then
a<00:00:23.279> 10<00:00:23.609> 4<00:00:23.939> millimeter<00:00:24.390> bolt<00:00:25.109> circle<00:00:25.320> diameter

a 10 4 millimeter bolt circle diameter

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.730 
a 10 4 millimeter bolt circle diameter
which<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> difference<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> distance

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
which is the difference the distance

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.320 
which is the difference the distance
from<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> center<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
from the center out to there which is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.650 
from the center out to there which is
hard<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> measure<00:00:32.000> that's<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.120> most<00:00:33.300> common

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
hard to measure that's your most common

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
hard to measure that's your most common

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
size the smallest chainring that you can

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
size the smallest chainring that you can
run<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> middle<00:00:37.530> ring<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:37.860> large<00:00:38.070> ring

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
position on the four bolt is a 32 tooth

position on the four bolt is a 32 tooth
jan<00:00:42.629> ring<00:00:42.890> then<00:00:43.890> we've<00:00:44.070> got<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:45.800> 100<00:00:46.800> 10

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
jan ring then we've got a 100 10

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.260 
jan ring then we've got a 100 10
millimeter<00:00:47.430> 5<00:00:47.940> bolt<00:00:48.300> set<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.820> still

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
millimeter 5 bolt set up which you still

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.979 
millimeter 5 bolt set up which you still
see<00:00:51.570> occasionally<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.690> downhill

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
see occasionally on on some downhill

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.369 
see occasionally on on some downhill
bikes<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> stuff<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:57.420> uh<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
bikes and stuff like that that is uh so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.750 
bikes and stuff like that that is uh so
it's<00:00:58.620> 110<00:01:00.590> millimeters<00:01:01.590> from<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> there

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's 110 millimeters from there to there

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.200 
it's 110 millimeters from there to there
versus<00:01:03.660> 104<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> lay<00:01:06.090> them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
versus 104 you can see if you lay them

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
versus 104 you can see if you lay them
over<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.250> fact<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.630> bit

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
over this one is in fact a little bit

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
over this one is in fact a little bit
bigger<00:01:09.930> than<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> yeah<00:01:11.450> lamb<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.369> 5

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bigger than that yeah lamb over so the 5

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
bigger than that yeah lamb over so the 5
110<00:01:15.330> stuff<00:01:15.659> smallest<00:01:16.759> chainring<00:01:17.759> size<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
110 stuff smallest chainring size you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
110 stuff smallest chainring size you
can<00:01:18.450> run<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> 110<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:21.619> 33<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> can't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
can run on the 110 is a 33 and you can't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
can run on the 110 is a 33 and you can't
usually<00:01:23.340> find<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> 33<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> 34<00:01:24.960> tooth<00:01:25.229> chainring

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
usually find a 33 to 34 tooth chainring

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
usually find a 33 to 34 tooth chainring
so<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.670> slightly<00:01:27.630> lower<00:01:27.780> gearing

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so if you want slightly lower gearing

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.770 
so if you want slightly lower gearing
it's<00:01:28.500> best<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.270> four<00:01:30.270> bolt<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.600> you're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's best to go with four bolt if you're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530 
it's best to go with four bolt if you're
given<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> 5<00:01:31.470> 110<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.220> 4<00:01:32.610> 10<00:01:32.790> 4<00:01:33.030> s<00:01:33.150> options

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
given the 5 110 and the 4 10 4 s options

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.399 
given the 5 110 and the 4 10 4 s options
and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:35.280> favorite<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.780> course<00:01:36.810> now

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and then my favorite and of course now

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.080 
and then my favorite and of course now
obsolete<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.430> hard<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.909> size<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.659> 5<00:01:40.619> bolt

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
obsolete and hard to get size is 5 bolt

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.050 
obsolete and hard to get size is 5 bolt
with<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> 94<00:01:42.750> millimeter<00:01:43.110> diameter<00:01:43.399> so<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> 94

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
with a 94 millimeter diameter so the 94

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.069 
with a 94 millimeter diameter so the 94
millimeter<00:01:45.450> diameter<00:01:45.950> allows<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> run<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
millimeter diameter allows you to run a

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.700 
millimeter diameter allows you to run a
smallest<00:01:49.079> middle<00:01:49.920> chainring<00:01:50.220> size<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:51.000> 29

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
smallest middle chainring size of 29

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.209 
smallest middle chainring size of 29
teeth<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.840> range<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> way

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
teeth so that that range all the way

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.810 
teeth so that that range all the way
down<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.430> 29<00:01:56.790> verses<00:01:57.360> 32<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.409> 34<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> really

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
down to 29 verses 32 or 34 it's a really

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
down to 29 verses 32 or 34 it's a really
significant<00:02:00.540> drop<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.750> gear<00:02:01.079> switch<00:02:01.350> allows

significant drop in gear switch allows

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.719 
significant drop in gear switch allows
you<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> wider<00:02:02.399> range<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.820> gearing<00:02:04.729> as

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you to have a wider range of gearing as

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.700 
you to have a wider range of gearing as
