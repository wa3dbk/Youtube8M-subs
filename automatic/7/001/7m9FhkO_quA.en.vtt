00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.599
 there are scientific studies and indications 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.450
 solids that I have contrasted with more than 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.990
 200 neurologists that allow us to affirm 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.119
 that the frequent practice of chess 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.630
 delays brain aging and 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.060
 could delay or even prevent the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.220
 alzheimer this seems to me to be a subject 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 capital and that's why I dedicate a broad 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.139
 chapter in the book because in the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.659
 most, not to say all countries 

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:37.789
 developed the life expectancy not 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.069
 stop increasing that in principle is a 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.049
 great news we live more but 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.179
 it's also a huge problem from the 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.949
 economic point of view for all 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.159
 governments that have to allocate 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.109
 huge amounts of money to care 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.449
 of older people who do not use 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.159
 themselves that depend on others for 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.440
 both improve the health of our 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.039
 seniors becomes a priority one 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.460
 question of state then how 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.710
 preventing is better and cheaper than curing 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.049
 obviously if we take chess 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.640
 mind gym the best would be 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.030
 introduce it in schools as 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.650
 subject but all the studies 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.710
 concerning the prevention of Alzheimer's 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.229
 show that the most important thing is 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.170
 mental exercise that you do in the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.090
 decades before old age, not those 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.790
 you do as a child but what you do when 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.100
 you are already an adult so much the same as now 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.680
 we have this concept of going to the gym 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 to exercise is good for your health 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.380
 from now on the mental gym goes 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.509
 to be an idea a concept that is going to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.000
 put on fashion is going to be say in the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.280
 mind of all concerned people 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.500
 to reach old age appropriately the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.840
 most known experiment about this is 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.360
 he did in the institute albert einstein of 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 new york where it was shown that the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.000
 older people playing chess 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.159
 or to bridge or they danced because to dance 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.740
 requires perfect coordination between 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.619
 mind and rest of the body were those 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.289
 more they increased their brain power their 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.570
 cognitive reserve at an age in which 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.700
 the normal thing is to lose it that's why the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.950
 director of this study the doctor 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.830
 in an interview to Washington Post 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.349
 he said shortly after we are not far from the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.019
 day when our family doctor 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.510
 we prescribe a crossword and a 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.489
 chess game every day exercise 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.879
 moderate physical and feeding 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.879
 balanced
