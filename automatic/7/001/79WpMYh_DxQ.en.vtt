00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.450
 good kids and goes by everis 31 obvious 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.280
 of gta 5 online and today I bring you 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.170
 very strong information about a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.910
 new dlc of bank robberies and all that 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.070
 and it's good that an Englishman has 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.650
 decipher some rockstar codes of 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.820
 a mission about a bank robbery and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 well the information the truth is that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.660
 it looks pretty real in the back this 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.460
 bank that you are watching in the background and good 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.050
 then I will go to my computer and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.400
 I'm going to show you all the information that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.480
 has gone to the pages also the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.219
 I will leave in the description so that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.559
 you can see it but it looks good 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.930
 quite real not and it would be a new dlc 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.910
 that would include theft missions to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.380
 banks that you already know how good they have 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.290
 already said many times that they are going to 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.180
 put and such it would be in 2014 and good 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.680
 Well, right at the beginning of 2014, 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.540
 these rumors and good has been revealed 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.070
 the code has been deciphered and it has 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.920
 got your information so it's 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.230
 almost 100% real is already known what the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.539
 mission even the places the dialogues 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.070
 included also and good the money that 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.600
 is going to share the experience and everything 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.670
 I'm going to teach that then 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.719
 so good we go to the good pc 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.100
 kids, we are here in my 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.990
 I'm going to teach you all the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 details about the mission as you see 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.380
 We have two pages with information that 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.399
 I will leave you in the description if you want or 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 create yourselves 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.420
 but I'm going to explain a little this 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.070
 beige that is the map of the saints 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.060
 here we have would be where the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.369
 mission is worth 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.200
 you will see that put good trabanco where 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.880
 start after here it would supposedly be 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.770
 where we would take the vehicles that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.869
 we had prepared for us either 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.060
 I suppose it would be something specialized 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.799
 to steal and all that and that would be 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.539
 exactly where is the bank robbery 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.759
 ok that 's exactly this point is 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.890
 where is the bank really and good at 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.030
 this point would be nothing is simply 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.520
 the twitter of the one who has done this that the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.990
 put there for us to pass and good 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.970
 would be that is simply here where 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.649
 we started where we took the movie 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.420
 from here where we steal and well here 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.490
 in this on this page we can see a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.470
 little what you give about the mission here 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.840
 we will see good if you want to read put everything 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220
 what are we going to earn the money the rp and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.929
 all that would apply a little bit for 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.250
 above and here we would have all the 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.319
 conversations that would occur 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.479
 during the robbery and now we will see 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.840
 more in detail and good as annie 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.580
 you see then they give you 80 thousand in cash 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 throughout the mission that's that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.190
 I would share among all you do 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.230
 the heist worth 80,000 that is good 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.730
 if you have used here all that is like 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 to Moscow but it's pretty good to be 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 a robbery 80,000 divided by four 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.260
 people would not touch wenches 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.900
 20,000 and good you rp and we would win a thousand 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.270
 140 for the mission if it's the first time 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 the money will be shared as it has already 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.010
 said and well then let's take a look see 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.980
 around here you had to be level 60 and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.020
 that we should be at least 4 and maximum 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.970
 six players is worth to make the robbery 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.070
 and well, here we can also see 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.560
 pretty curious conversations like 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.780
 for example says defend your partner 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 of equipment while fatigues the terminal or 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.350
 be that one of us will have to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.760
 make good hacker and as the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.930
 policemen are yes that's good what 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.260
 they will leave the description to read it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.670
 there's a lot of information and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.290
 good practically everything that is going to 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.610
 say during the mission wrong so 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.080
 good is here and quite all the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.360
 information but the most interesting 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.560
 we would say that it would be about 80 thousand 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.710
 divided by the number of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.940
 re participants but it will give 1100 that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.520
 one is fine but neither is nothing 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.530
 exaggerated and one seems quite real not 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.239
 At least we will be four in the team 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.590
 so we can not do everything 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.450
 the time that we want 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.010
 that maybe he does not have many friends or 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.019
 that, yes, it will cost him to do the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.060
 works, I just think that the 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.260
 people that you have in the session and such 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.610
 yes they will be willing to do it 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.900
 so nothing, here you have all the 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.540
 information I'll leave it in the description 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.430
 and nothing to thank also a friend 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.480
 that was not with me discovering all 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.220
 this information we have been 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.390
 investigating a bit and such I'll leave 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.580
 overcome in the description so that you 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.750
 I would appreciate it much more 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.090
 kids, I hope you liked it 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.500
 that you can life favorites if it is so 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.519
 share with your friends and what 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.519
 we see in the next video
