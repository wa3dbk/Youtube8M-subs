00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.520
 for more than a year we had been pursuing the conquest of the summit 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.300
 of the Trash cinema the highest in the municipal district of San Pedro de Alcantara 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.969
 but for some things or other occasion after occasion they were frustrating 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 going down the submerged mountain nickname the damn 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.769
 on Sunday, January 14, 2007 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.480
 we conspire and if we see once and for all end the myth today that never 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.980
 we said we'll go to the cursed summit or we talk it's tenth we 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350
 We dedicate to playing mus 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.140
 no choice 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 at half past nine we left from a nearby port to remember 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.740
 between two boots that we bought lighted a month before and abandoned 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.820
 since we put together the mountain is that we have to learn to draw a fan 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.190
 gandolas 4 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.660
 5 cares seemed easy 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 on an amd chip we compensate to sing victory 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 two 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 Nothing is further from reality 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.650
 Bicycle rope is especially hard 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.930
 without path my path full of big mountain stones that are divided into 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.760
 another one hundred 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.590
 when adding by headwaters of gullies that force you to climb and sometimes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.980
 even to climb 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.420
 endless hills to one of my children as such 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.700
 forests that you have to go through dressing them like the nano forest 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.550
 that leaves you his mark with looking aÃ±azos and while we took a step after others 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.260
 we do not look, I think thinking the same 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.570
 I can not anymore you have to go back but not our inaction determination was 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.220
 firm 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.380
 We did not want to give up and we continued as we could until the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 two minus four finally we came face to face with the Mexico post 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 we had reached our goal we had conquered in infinite and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.500
 can you imagine Cuba 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 very happy 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.060
 we barely have time to take some pictures and eat something fast 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 we had taken more than four hours to arrive 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.890
 we would try almost the same thing back 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.000
 and the worst of all strong or the morning is taking its toll on 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 of cramps and jerks the night was on him 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.049
 We could see in time 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.930
 we walk very slowly stopping member of the group so that the muscles 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.339
 transcendent is impulsive looking at the clock 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.569
 wondering what it would be like to spend the night 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 in the inhospitable lands of the infinite to the weather 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.979
 already in the car we shook hands very tired 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.639
 river been very long 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.439
 more than eight hours walking but very happy a very good Andean day 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.479
 remember 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:52.439
 and to count 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.180
 anyone who wants to listen to us
