took too few cavalry however tough they
might<00:04:37.950> have<00:04:38.100> been<00:04:38.310> individually<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.390> then

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
might have been individually and then

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.320 
might have been individually and then
split<00:04:40.260> them<00:04:40.440> he<00:04:41.370> would<00:04:41.550> have<00:04:41.760> done<00:04:41.910> better<00:04:42.120> to

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330
