we<00:00:46.320> planted<00:00:47.840> some<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.110> died<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we planted some of them died we had a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.630 
we planted some of them died we had a
lot<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> rain<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.200> we<00:00:52.200> planted<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:54.450> then

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
lot of rain and we planted more and then

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
lot of rain and we planted more and then
then<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.850> needed<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:57.360> ginger<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> couple<00:00:58.260> of

then we needed some ginger a couple of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.100 
then we needed some ginger a couple of
months<00:00:58.470> ago<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.129> we<00:01:01.040> hold<00:01:02.040> early<00:01:03.080> then<00:01:04.080> we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
months ago so we hold early then we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.430 
months ago so we hold early then we
harvested<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> weaker<00:01:05.400> ones<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.200> strategy

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
harvested the weaker ones so my strategy

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.700 
harvested the weaker ones so my strategy
there<00:01:08.030> being<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.869> stronger<00:01:10.380> ones<00:01:10.560> are

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there being that the stronger ones are

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.499 
there being that the stronger ones are
going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.130> more<00:01:11.369> growth<00:01:11.759> than<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:12.240> Wicker

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
going to get more growth than the Wicker

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.850 
going to get more growth than the Wicker
once<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.649> we<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.190> left<00:01:14.430> five<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.080> strongest

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
once so we we left five of the strongest

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.210 
once so we we left five of the strongest
ones<00:01:18.020> through<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.940> little<00:01:20.940> bit<00:01:21.060> context<00:01:21.479> there

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
ones through a little bit context there

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.930 
ones through a little bit context there
