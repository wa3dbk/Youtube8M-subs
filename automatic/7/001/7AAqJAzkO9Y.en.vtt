00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello to our vendors today for us 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.480
 most interesting mod which is return 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 become a real beekeeper for this us 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 need to brighten up clothes beekeeper 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 which color with as follows 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 you see I already washed down a whole circus 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.039
 new and crafting is easy enough 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
 need skin thread 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 Well, in order to make normal 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.769
 I also need a hat and iron 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 bars well for everything else 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.510
 it takes only skin to thread if 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.460
 who cares to remember combinations well 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 or on pause as you will be more comfortable 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.379
 actually here are all the craft I showed you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 and after you can put on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 yourself all this armor which unfortunately 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.649
 yes it is very little armor 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 you will almost become a real beekeeper 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.309
 you can make yourself on the feed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 hysterical things but let's actually 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.620
 let's see how we will extract honey and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.210
 other interesting things to start us 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.250
 need to find a tree on which 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 the hive will hang will give a new generation 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.510
 such trees will be quite a lot and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 can be found by the characteristic 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 a lot of bees that fly 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 in the county who are honestly not very 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.119
 look like bees but let's make a discount 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.430
 on the fact that it is minecraft and proper 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 what can we do with this hive well 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 firstly if you have a bucket then you 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.759
 You can come and collect yourself honey 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.159
 drink this honey whose sleep will restore 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.560
 you are hungry and it is very convenient for me 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.210
 can also take and break it just 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 break and give you fall out 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 here are such things will fall out 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 dead bees as far as hardcore 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.960
 I do not know to judge you but you will fall here 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 such nonsense is roughly wax 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.090
 what we can do out of wax wax 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.829
 we can already make another evidence 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 which can be put in any 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.479
 convenient place for you you can do 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 own apiary actually like this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.049
 Now look, these hives can be roughly 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 leave a few of them and will be around 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 appear bees and you masses again but you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.810
 you can get honey here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.899
 proper endless source of energy 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.840
 and food is in my very cool all the more 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.670
 a bucket of honey will restore 2 spline as much as two 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.210
 half well let's call it pieces 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.890
 meat 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.810
 so here so what else 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.879
 interesting is the fashion in 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.300
 there are candles in this fashion yes yes 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.150
 exactly 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.300
 all and they are done for 2 units of ours 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.610
 favorite wax and one thread that we 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.190
 We can be extracted from spiders for example, and what 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.980
 they are different from ordinary torch but nothing 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 except appearance but maybe shining 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 a little stronger let's actually 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.790
 check it out and turn on the night you'll see 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.790
 from them the light comes out but honestly 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.410
 saying not much stronger and yes many 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.360
 I ask that for the same texture 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.750
 these are shaders if you are interested you can 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.410
 googling of you them your mccroft no 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.300
 by fun 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 actually candles I showed you and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.280
 let's go to comfortable and cool things 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.920
 pleasant snacks this mod 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.850
 specifically to the idea here is not so much eat 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.690
 but the less there is 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.460
 a roll of honey itself and mead yes yes innocent 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 the 2 most so often 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 glorified in various legends 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.060
 carrying out their cartoons stories 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.950
 conducting well actually i think everything with 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 familiar with her and how is it all sneak 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.670
 named mead seems very simple 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.760
 given that the buckets are kept 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.520
 only need two buckets and an empty 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.739
 small bottle empty small bottle vial 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.540
 we took it put it here and get 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.209
 mead exactly so it is called and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.180
 then I wanted to show you how to do it 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.150
 bread bread with honey is very cool 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.550
 thing now as soon as I find the bread 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.110
 which I have prepared before 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 but somewhere gone 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.820
 magically disappeared here is the usual 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.370
 bread we take bread and we take plain honey 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.500
 which we extract from our apiary you 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.750
 will call and so we get honey with 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.459
 bread and let us test it 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.200
 first drink of mead 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.750
 and you yourself will see what a cool effect 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 she gives drink mead and we 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.140
 acceleration with this we are much faster 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.300
 chop chop straight 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.250
 chop chop stone any way you see 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.410
 much faster we start hitting the ground 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.870
 anything can be done faster with 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.550
 using mead but with time into effect 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.100
 from her of course you now disappear 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.650
 see everything there for 20 seconds and you yourself 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.360
 see as without mead we will usually 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.920
 beat it a lot slower here 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.989
 actually disappeared mead effect all 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.260
 immediately slowed down and it's sad and 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.510
 let's sit down 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.360
 spring why spring honey bread 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.520
 which we painted over themselves he insists 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.540
 in my five of those not mistaken these 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.580
 halves 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.100
 again the halves of this year and 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.680
 actually here is such a mod on this 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.010
 everything seems to be said about it 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.840
 beekeeping fashion 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.060
 I think it would be cool if 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.340
 send their visit as answers and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.230
 it will be funny on this was all with 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.150
 you were a bender subscribe to the channel 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.250
 put your thumb up and start you 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.470
 for the ass right now the bee won't bite 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.350
 bit correctly because I put 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.120
 Like everybody thanks for watching everyone bye 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.640
 and by the way forgot to say that if you 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.220
 without this battle you will be fucking 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.220
 cover all this all all bye
