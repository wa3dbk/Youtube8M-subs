00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.980
 Hello, I'm Alice and today I 'm going to 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.030
 prepare a rich another half for your 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.130
 meeting of being with panela cheese is a 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.300
 practical snack and is also for this 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 season 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.460
 the ingredients are panela cheese the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.460
 which is going to come back as a fork 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.589
 let's speak the panela cheese well 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.559
 a fork once we have it like that 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.550
 we are going to add the ingredients 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.860
 onion 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.860
 escambray finally chopped 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.149
 ah 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.149
 cilantro currently finally chopped 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.750
 serrano chile finely chopped without 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.050
 seed and without the veins so that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.920
 it stings so much 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.920
 and this is something 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.450
 we are going to add salt 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.110
 the taste a little pepper 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.700
 and we mix everything very well 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 or 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.000
 how 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.000
 lame 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.469
 but we're going to pass some mold that has 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.469
 a cap what you like 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.020
 ah 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.020
 to give you the presentation 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 or let's understand 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.570
 we will also catch it with plastic 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.570
 and we 'll refrigerate it for 15-20 minutes 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 a very good tip also that I'm going to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.870
 give is to preserve the cilantro what 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.810
 can put in a small glass in a jar 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.300
 with water and putting the bunch of 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.520
 cilantro and put it in the refrigerator and 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 will keep them for very much 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.280
 we take out of the refrigerator 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.690
 fellow cuts 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.690
 and we are going to dismantle 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 We are going to buy the mold for 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.960
 disassemble it and make the presentation 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.450
 this is how it is left 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.450
 and good we can accompany by totopos 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.780
 It is a practice 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 and as a beautiful presentation that has 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.510
 liked this recipe and do not forget
