show<00:00:00.390> you<00:00:00.450> in<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.780> video<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.260> how<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.500> drag

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
show you in this video is how to drag

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.610 
show you in this video is how to drag
lune<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.520> tunnel<00:00:02.939> ate<00:00:03.090> with<00:00:05.299> rage<00:00:06.299> spells<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
lune a tunnel ate with rage spells and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.709 
lune a tunnel ate with rage spells and
maybe<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> heel<00:00:08.840> so<00:00:09.950> there<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:11.010> three<00:00:11.719> three

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
maybe a heel so there are three three

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.350 
maybe a heel so there are three three
steps<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:14.219> approach<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.179> first

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
steps to this this approach so the first

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.820 
steps to this this approach so the first
thing<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.540> need<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.500> create<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
thing you need to do is to create a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.570 
thing you need to do is to create a
funnel<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.869> once<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.170> create<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> funnel<00:00:19.800> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
funnel and once you create a funnel you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.170 
funnel and once you create a funnel you
spread<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.119> dragons<00:00:22.699> that's<00:00:23.699> step<00:00:23.970> two

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
spread out your dragons that's step two

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
spread out your dragons that's step two
and<00:00:24.840> after<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.439> spread<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.830> dragons

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and after you spread out your dragons

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.410 
and after you spread out your dragons
you<00:00:26.550> place<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:27.269> spell's<00:00:28.429> at<00:00:29.429> strategic

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you place your spell's at strategic

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
you place your spell's at strategic
points<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:31.019> accelerate<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.189> Dragons<00:00:32.640> through

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
points to accelerate the Dragons through

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.200 
points to accelerate the Dragons through
the<00:00:33.149> base<00:00:34.219> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.370> follow<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:35.790> three<00:00:36.149> steps

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the base if you follow these three steps

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
the base if you follow these three steps
you<00:00:36.930> should<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.559> able<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.829> demolish<00:00:38.129> almost

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you should be able to demolish almost

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.639 
you should be able to demolish almost
any<00:00:40.129> enemy<00:00:41.129> tunnel<00:00:41.430> eight<00:00:41.550> base<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
any enemy tunnel eight base and in this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.829 
any enemy tunnel eight base and in this
video<00:00:43.860> cheerio<00:00:44.489> does<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
video cheerio does it

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.040 
video cheerio does it
against<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:48.050> Nia<00:00:49.039> maxed<00:00:49.640> defenses<00:00:50.420> tunnel<00:00:50.839> 8

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
against a Nia maxed defenses tunnel 8

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.639 
against a Nia maxed defenses tunnel 8
which<00:00:51.530> has<00:00:51.739> max<00:00:52.039> air<00:00:52.699> defenses<00:00:54.430> right<00:00:55.479> so

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
which has max air defenses right so

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.180 
which has max air defenses right so
let's<00:00:57.649> just<00:00:57.769> see<00:00:58.100> how<00:00:58.219> he<00:00:58.280> does<00:00:58.399> it

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.250 

the<00:01:04.790> first<00:01:05.150> thing<00:01:05.300> he<00:01:05.330> does<00:01:05.540> he<00:01:05.930> places

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
the first thing he does he places

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.500 
the first thing he does he places
dragons<00:01:07.010> here<00:01:07.370> in<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.610> two<00:01:07.790> corners<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
dragons here in the two corners of the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.930 
dragons here in the two corners of the
base<00:01:09.370> and<00:01:10.370> what<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.670> does<00:01:11.440> by<00:01:12.440> taking<00:01:12.680> up

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
base and what it does by taking up

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.790 
base and what it does by taking up
the<00:01:14.450> structures<00:01:14.900> here<00:01:15.080> on<00:01:15.200> these<00:01:15.350> two<00:01:15.530> sides

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
the structures here on these two sides

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.460 
the structures here on these two sides
it<00:01:16.010> creates<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.460> funnel<00:01:16.820> for<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.960> rest<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.320> his

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
it creates a funnel for the rest of his

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.370 
it creates a funnel for the rest of his
dragons<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.550> move<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.300> tandem<00:01:20.570> throughout<00:01:21.200> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
dragons to move in tandem throughout the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.670 
dragons to move in tandem throughout the
base<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.940> look<00:01:23.090> by<00:01:24.020> spreading<00:01:24.320> out<00:01:24.530> his

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
base so if you look by spreading out his

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.060 
base so if you look by spreading out his
dragons<00:01:25.130> they<00:01:26.290> they<00:01:27.290> move<00:01:27.530> next<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.890> each

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
dragons they they move next to each

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.500 
dragons they they move next to each
other<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:28.610> don't<00:01:28.730> they<00:01:28.970> don't<00:01:29.000> spread

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
other and they don't they don't spread

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.510 
other and they don't they don't spread
out<00:01:29.660> they<00:01:29.870> don't<00:01:29.990> they<00:01:30.320> don't<00:01:30.370> clump<00:01:31.370> together

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
out they don't they don't clump together

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.300 
out they don't they don't clump together
they<00:01:31.970> don't<00:01:32.150> go<00:01:32.450> around<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.020> base<00:01:33.200> he<00:01:34.070> just

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
they don't go around the base he just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.490 
they don't go around the base he just
moved<00:01:34.580> nicely<00:01:35.390> unit<00:01:35.690> almost<00:01:36.020> uniformly

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
moved nicely unit almost uniformly

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.410 
moved nicely unit almost uniformly
across<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.160> base<00:01:38.560> then<00:01:39.560> he's<00:01:39.710> dropping<00:01:39.920> his

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
across the base then he's dropping his

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.220 
across the base then he's dropping his
his<00:01:41.420> rage<00:01:41.750> spells<00:01:42.280> early<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.810> purpose<00:01:45.020> of

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
his rage spells early and the purpose of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.560 
his rage spells early and the purpose of
that<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.790> accelerate<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.090> Dragons

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that is to accelerate the Dragons

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.010 
that is to accelerate the Dragons
through<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.350> base<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.340> get<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:50.020> air

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
through the base to get to the air

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.130 
through the base to get to the air
defenses<00:01:51.680> as<00:01:51.830> fast<00:01:52.370> as<00:01:52.580> possible<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.870> want

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
defenses as fast as possible so you want

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.400 
defenses as fast as possible so you want
to<00:01:54.230> place<00:01:54.380> them<00:01:54.530> early<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.690> your<00:01:56.690> dragons

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.660 

yeah<00:02:00.410> move<00:02:00.680> quickly<00:02:00.920> through<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.250> base<00:02:01.460> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
yeah move quickly through the base and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.280 
yeah move quickly through the base and
you'd<00:02:01.790> want<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.060> wait<00:02:02.210> until<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.660> dragons<00:02:03.080> are

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
you'd want to wait until the dragons are

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.840 
you'd want to wait until the dragons are
close<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.550> air<00:02:04.700> defense<00:02:05.060> before<00:02:05.540> you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
close to the air defense before you

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.120 
close to the air defense before you
reach<00:02:07.850> them<00:02:08.240> because<00:02:09.140> by<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:09.530> your<00:02:09.770> dragons

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
reach them because by then your dragons

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.640 
reach them because by then your dragons
would<00:02:10.250> have<00:02:10.369> taken<00:02:10.520> quite<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.300> bit<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.600> damage

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.979 

and<00:02:18.769> once<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.700> air<00:02:19.819> defenses<00:02:20.269> are<00:02:20.420> down<00:02:20.540> well

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
and once the air defenses are down well

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.089 
and once the air defenses are down well
yeah<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.180> enemy<00:02:23.180> base<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:24.590> demolished

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
yeah the enemy base is just demolished

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.080 
yeah the enemy base is just demolished
and<00:02:25.870> when<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.989> execute<00:02:27.349> an<00:02:27.769> attack<00:02:28.670> very<00:02:28.879> well

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
and when you execute an attack very well

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.069 
and when you execute an attack very well
like<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:31.430> get<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.849> ton<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.299> dragons<00:02:32.840> left

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
like this you get a ton of dragons left

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.740 
like this you get a ton of dragons left
look<00:02:33.439> this<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.890> two<00:02:34.310> three<00:02:34.730> four<00:02:35.030> five<00:02:35.329> six

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
look this one two three four five six

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.899
