to<00:03:56.930> kind<00:03:57.169> of<00:03:57.230> see<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.440> think<00:03:57.560> Francis<00:03:58.129> Hale<00:03:58.340> was

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
to kind of see I think Francis Hale was

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.039 
to kind of see I think Francis Hale was
the<00:03:58.700> guy<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:58.849> really<00:03:59.120> stood<00:03:59.389> out<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.569> me<00:03:59.690> 20

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
the guy that really stood out to me 20

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.330 
the guy that really stood out to me 20
years<00:04:00.079> old<00:04:00.470> 66<00:04:01.310> overall<00:04:01.810> 62<00:04:03.220> definitely<00:04:04.220> has

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
years old 66 overall 62 definitely has

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.830 
years old 66 overall 62 definitely has
some<00:04:04.579> good<00:04:04.730> height<00:04:04.910> for<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.180> receiver<00:04:05.510> his

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
some good height for a receiver his

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.180 
some good height for a receiver his
awareness<00:04:06.079> is<00:04:06.410> terrible<00:04:06.799> if<00:04:06.859> we<00:04:06.889> can<00:04:07.099> improve

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
awareness is terrible if we can improve

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.470 
awareness is terrible if we can improve
that<00:04:07.579> you<00:04:07.790> know<00:04:07.879> it<00:04:08.000> could<00:04:08.120> be<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> better

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
that you know it could be a better

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.259 
that you know it could be a better
player<00:04:08.720> also<00:04:08.959> his<00:04:09.260> catches<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.919> great<00:04:10.269> only

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
player also his catches and great only

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.089 
player also his catches and great only
78<00:04:11.989> but<00:04:12.349> that's<00:04:12.500> something<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:12.919> could

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
78 but that's something we could

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.569 
78 but that's something we could
potentially<00:04:13.579> work<00:04:13.699> on<00:04:13.910> who's<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.299> oh<00:04:14.480> um<00:04:15.579> you

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
potentially work on who's that oh um you

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.250 
potentially work on who's that oh um you
know<00:04:16.729> route<00:04:17.000> running<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.359> release<00:04:17.630> not<00:04:17.989> good

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
know route running a release not good

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.920 
know route running a release not good
but<00:04:18.680> he<00:04:19.039> has<00:04:19.190> great<00:04:19.640> acceleration<00:04:20.090> in<00:04:20.659> great

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
but he has great acceleration in great

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.090 
but he has great acceleration in great
speed

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
speed

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.310 
speed
and<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:22.880> very<00:04:23.300> valuable<00:04:23.810> trait<00:04:24.290> to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
and that is a very valuable trait to

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.340 
and that is a very valuable trait to
have<00:04:24.500> especially<00:04:25.130> when<00:04:25.670> he<00:04:25.760> has<00:04:26.030> 62<00:04:26.480> height<00:04:27.140> as

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
have especially when he has 62 height as

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.590 
have especially when he has 62 height as
well<00:04:27.590> definitely<00:04:28.550> potentially<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> player

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
well definitely potentially a player

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.520 
well definitely potentially a player
that<00:04:29.630> we<00:04:29.930> could<00:04:30.110> use<00:04:30.490> um<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.050> question<00:04:33.410> is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
that we could use um but the question is

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.500 
that we could use um but the question is
warning<00:04:34.070> what<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.340> do<00:04:34.520> guy<00:04:34.760> just<00:04:34.940> notice<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
warning what to do guy just notice that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.940 
warning what to do guy just notice that
uh<00:04:35.750> go<00:04:36.590> tarheels<00:04:36.890> um<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:39.050> do<00:04:39.500> i<00:04:39.530> do<00:04:39.650> i

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
uh go tarheels um but you know do i do i

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.820 
uh go tarheels um but you know do i do i
go<00:04:40.160> ahead<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.430> sign<00:04:40.580> somebody<00:04:40.910> now<00:04:41.210> or<00:04:41.770> do<00:04:42.770> I

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
go ahead and sign somebody now or do I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.150 
go ahead and sign somebody now or do I
wait<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:44.540> see<00:04:44.780> if<00:04:44.900> anybody<00:04:45.320> gets<00:04:45.470> released<00:04:45.950> I

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
wait to see if anybody gets released I

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.350 
wait to see if anybody gets released I
think<00:04:46.430> right<00:04:46.610> now<00:04:46.820> we're<00:04:47.000> going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.150> wait<00:04:47.330> to

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
think right now we're going to wait to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.360 
think right now we're going to wait to
see<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:47.660> somebody<00:04:47.900> gets<00:04:48.140> released<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.860> think

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
see if somebody gets released I think

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.220 
see if somebody gets released I think
that's<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.670> best<00:04:49.910> bet<00:04:50.330> at<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.840> point<00:04:51.140> in

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
that's the best bet at this point in

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.010 
that's the best bet at this point in
time<00:04:51.370> nobody's<00:04:52.370> gotten<00:04:52.700> released<00:04:53.000> yet<00:04:53.300> I've

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
time nobody's gotten released yet I've

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.960 
time nobody's gotten released yet I've
already<00:04:54.260> checked<00:04:54.560> this<00:04:54.830> looks<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.640> players
