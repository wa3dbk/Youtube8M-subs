00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.200 
case the only ones got a ball joint was
the<00:02:00.000> pop<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> trial<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.890> Scott<00:02:01.890> Steiner

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
the pop up on trial here Scott Steiner

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.249 
the pop up on trial here Scott Steiner
but<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.110> blue

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
but even then I had to put some blue

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.929 
but even then I had to put some blue
attack<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.590> between<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> few

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
attack in between and make a few

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
attack in between and make a few
adjustments<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> rest<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.170> they

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
adjustments but the rest of them they

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.609 
adjustments but the rest of them they
didn't<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.220> ball<00:02:08.399> jointed<00:02:08.700> heads<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.500> was

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
didn't have ball jointed heads so it was

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
didn't have ball jointed heads so it was
quite<00:02:10.800> tricking<00:02:11.190> me<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.550> well<00:02:11.790> with

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
quite tricking me with this well with

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
quite tricking me with this well with
the<00:02:12.030> color<00:02:12.209> Hoffman<00:02:12.540> one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the color Hoffman one

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.620 
the color Hoffman one
to<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:13.950> burn<00:02:14.190> off<00:02:14.430> parts<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.300> his<00:02:15.450> neck

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
to actually burn off parts of his neck

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.550 
to actually burn off parts of his neck
so<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.290> could<00:02:16.350> fit<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.100> nicely<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.560> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so that I could fit in nicely and I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.780 
so that I could fit in nicely and I
didn't<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.010> such<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> good<00:02:20.370> job<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:20.730> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
didn't do such a good job with that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.750 
didn't do such a good job with that
that's<00:02:21.000> why<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> scoffs<00:02:21.540> wrap<00:02:21.780> around<00:02:22.020> there

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
that's why the scoffs wrap around there

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.650 
that's why the scoffs wrap around there
bear<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.850> mind<00:02:23.880> people<00:02:24.210> when<00:02:24.300> you're<00:02:24.420> doing

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
bear in mind people when you're doing

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
bear in mind people when you're doing
these<00:02:24.800> customs<00:02:25.800> are<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:25.980> trying<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> curate

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
these customs are you trying to curate

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.490 
these customs are you trying to curate
these<00:02:26.640> new<00:02:26.820> figures<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.960> want<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.350> very

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
these new figures you want to be very

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
these new figures you want to be very
careful<00:02:28.770> because<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.580> ruin<00:02:30.030> your

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
careful because you can ruin your

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.840 
careful because you can ruin your
figures<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.190> kind<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
figures so you have to really kind of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.120 
figures so you have to really kind of
make<00:02:33.120> sure<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.510> you're<00:02:33.660> doing<00:02:34.130> unless

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
make sure you know you're doing unless
