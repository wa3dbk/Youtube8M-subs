00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
there I'm not touching anything it's

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.140 
there I'm not touching anything it's
going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.920> come<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> same<00:02:47.610> spot<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.120> was

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
going to come up in the same spot it was

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.210 
going to come up in the same spot it was
that<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> saved<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:50.040> how<00:02:50.190> I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that when I saved it and that's how I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
that when I saved it and that's how I
took<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.640> pictures<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.050> just<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
took my pictures and it's just because I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.710 
took my pictures and it's just because I
change<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> resolution<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:54.120> thing's<00:02:54.420> got

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
change the resolution that thing's got

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.960 
change the resolution that thing's got
got<00:02:55.319> moved<00:02:55.650> back<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.100> forth<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.580> they<00:02:56.730> change

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
got moved back and forth as they change

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.030 
got moved back and forth as they change
the<00:02:57.150> resolution<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.770> little

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
the resolution and I think as a little

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.680 
the resolution and I think as a little
more<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.940> how<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:00.120> set<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.510> up

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
more do because of how they set it up

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.960 
more do because of how they set it up
with<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> sixteen<00:03:01.319> by<00:03:01.470> nine<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.819> can

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
with the sixteen by nine and as you can

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.290 
with the sixteen by nine and as you can
see<00:03:03.000> here<00:03:04.040> I've<00:03:05.040> lost<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.520> lot<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.700> stuff<00:03:06.000> over
