00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:47.800
 apart from that this will be an asset of a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.809
 inch higher all plates of 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.960
 protection under that others the other 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.350
 versions don't have a lot of them 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.699
 more stuff to what they cost then 53 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.360
 thousand euros 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.229
 look at the chosen faces and have fun 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.399
 they will say it should not be looked at has stopped instead 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.399
 they don't know we're waiting 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.700
 there are many 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 all watching but sorry second 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.909
 how can that thing be? 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.470
 the electronic goes there in the middle are 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.159
 the only one I asked for a ride 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.880
 with you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.880
 no no others are already the only crazy 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.580
 I tell you when I can only get up 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.710
 on tumblr you buy stuff like that 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.710
 to find it use a price 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.830
 because already after 60 years get on a 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.830
 big jump 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.430
 this will have ten years of life already a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.430
 decent price will be found 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.819
 resists making info 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.360
 well i do 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.360
 I like I do 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.330
 all right stuff that would be so convenient 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.070
 also it seems inghart with pressure 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.780
 of the tires to the bravo 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:56.000
 all stuff that surely in the next 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.000
 2017 model will also see add 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.030
 there is no Rome 30 st 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.320
 and 70 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.430
 up here 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.760
 and see 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.539
 according to me it will not decide the same one 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.449
 both the space also with these tires here 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.169
 it just goes same now we do n't expect 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.169
 serenely 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.120
 Now 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.320
 this 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.750
 pity there is no way to raise the 7 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.570
 further not maybe to bad 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.640
 you could do something more with messages 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.670
 it wouldn't hurt but now you just know 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.400
 exit they tried but it's a lot 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.730
 difficult is a version not it 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.210
 appearing with the tires of the 33 i 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.010
 put on hand everything cut a 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.950
 body piece done all a kit 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.070
 so then there is all those fenders of 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.540
 land with irony view of the parks there 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.610
 they cut car body parts 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.800
 to make that and a track center 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.270
 in my opinion they did n't wear it I didn't 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.270
 just cut the bodywork 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.460
 now let's see this climb without it 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.850
 without accelerating too much if in grip 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.639
 make it the block is tried to put it 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.800
 no no now without a lock no i say in 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.630
 some traits tried to put them ninth 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.630
 it cannot serve would make it win 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.740
 story 3 km to them 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.910
 see if not the simple puts the 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.910
 block between are road tires 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.289
 a grip 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.430
 with me 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.200
 However 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.200
 around blue
