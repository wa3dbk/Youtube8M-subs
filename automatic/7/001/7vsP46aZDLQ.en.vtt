00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
to turn have this into an aquaponic

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.250 
to turn have this into an aquaponic
system<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.900> grow<00:00:10.019> some<00:00:10.230> vegetables

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
system so we can grow some vegetables

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.509 
system so we can grow some vegetables
for<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.190> be<00:00:11.340> rabbits<00:00:12.590> and<00:00:13.590> ourselves<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:14.280> we

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
for this be rabbits and ourselves if we

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.950 
for this be rabbits and ourselves if we
get<00:00:14.670> enough<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.089> them<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.420> any<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:15.929> not

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
get enough of them but any of I'm not

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.769 
get enough of them but any of I'm not
using<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.379> whole<00:00:16.560> lot<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.070> space<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
using a whole lot of space on this as of

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.560 
using a whole lot of space on this as of
right<00:00:18.930> now<00:00:19.250> but<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.640> figured<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.240> could<00:00:21.390> use

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
right now but I just figured I could use

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.120 
right now but I just figured I could use
this<00:00:21.720> extra<00:00:22.080> space<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.769> currently

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this extra space that we have currently

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
this extra space that we have currently
and<00:00:23.730> cuz<00:00:24.330> I've<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> unused<00:00:25.560> space

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and cuz I've got a lot of unused space

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
and cuz I've got a lot of unused space
that<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.699> making<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> best<00:00:27.300> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that I'm not really making the best of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.640 
that I'm not really making the best of
so<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.080> start<00:00:28.320> filling<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
so I'm going to go and start filling it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
so I'm going to go and start filling it
with<00:00:28.680> stuff<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.250> doing<00:00:30.150> something<00:00:30.539> and

with stuff that's doing something and
I'm<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.619> doing<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> deep<00:00:31.980> water<00:00:32.160> culture<00:00:32.369> raft

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I'm just doing a deep water culture raft

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.260 
I'm just doing a deep water culture raft
right<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:34.700> I'm<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> end<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.090> using

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right here I'm going to end up using

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.160 
right here I'm going to end up using
multiple<00:00:36.750> pieces<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.350> styrofoam<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
multiple pieces of this styrofoam it's a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
multiple pieces of this styrofoam it's a
this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.309> half<00:00:41.460> inch<00:00:41.760> hopefully<00:00:42.450> it'll

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
this is just half inch hopefully it'll

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
this is just half inch hopefully it'll
work<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.989> i<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> time<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
work out i will see in time but if it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.770 
work out i will see in time but if it
doesn't<00:00:44.969> i'll<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.600> thicker

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
doesn't i'll just get some thicker

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.740 
doesn't i'll just get some thicker
styrofoam<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.070> i'm<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> end<00:00:48.660> up

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
styrofoam but i'm just going to end up

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.950 
styrofoam but i'm just going to end up
putting<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.200> i'm<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> cut<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> fit

through here i'm going to actually bring
it<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.699> since<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.390> pieces<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.870> like

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it you know since the pieces are like

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
it you know since the pieces are like
this<00:00:55.289> i'm<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> cut<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> the

okay got everything in so that's pretty

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.309 
okay got everything in so that's pretty
much<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.489> for<00:02:16.670> today<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.480> got<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.900> couple<00:02:18.050> of

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
much it for today just got a couple of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.890 
much it for today just got a couple of
different<00:02:18.620> plants<00:02:18.770> going<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.670> here<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.150> just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
different plants going on in here I just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.680 
different plants going on in here I just
some<00:02:21.080> stuff<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.530> had<00:02:22.030> already<00:02:23.030> growing<00:02:23.420> out

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
some stuff I had already growing out

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.660 
some stuff I had already growing out
here<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.140> I'm<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.380> seeing<00:02:25.190> how<00:02:25.370> it's<00:02:25.520> going

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
here so I'm just seeing how it's going

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.180 
here so I'm just seeing how it's going
to<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.569> setup<00:02:26.840> versus<00:02:27.830> how<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.010> was

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
to do in the setup versus how it was

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
to do in the setup versus how it was
because<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.520> lot<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.970> wasn't<00:02:29.330> doing<00:02:29.599> so

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
because a lot of this wasn't doing so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.720 
because a lot of this wasn't doing so
great<00:02:30.110> there's<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> couple<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.340> bell<00:02:31.489> pepper

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
great there's a couple of bell pepper

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.600 
great there's a couple of bell pepper
plants<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.660> end<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.310> next<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.580> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
plants on the end there next to a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.360 
plants on the end there next to a
Moringa<00:02:35.150> tree<00:02:36.069> hopefully<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.099> didn't<00:02:37.340> damage

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
Moringa tree hopefully I didn't damage

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.550 
Moringa tree hopefully I didn't damage
the<00:02:37.880> taproot<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:39.050> getting<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.410> one

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the taproot when I was getting that one

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.620 
the taproot when I was getting that one
out<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.880> tricky<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.360> we'll

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
out but it's a little tricky so we'll

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.500 
out but it's a little tricky so we'll
see<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.050> then<00:02:42.830> they<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.209> think<00:02:44.390> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
see and then they just like I think it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
see and then they just like I think it's
a<00:02:44.569> chili<00:02:44.780> pepper<00:02:44.870> plant<00:02:45.410> over<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.010> also<00:02:46.340> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
a chili pepper plant over there also and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.729 
a chili pepper plant over there also and

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.030 
then a couple of Swiss chard plants back
there<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:52.959> several<00:02:54.040> everbearing

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
there and then several everbearing

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.940
