turntable<00:01:58.189> skipping<00:01:58.790> or<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.030> not<00:01:59.119> heavy

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
turntable skipping or it's not heavy

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.820 
turntable skipping or it's not heavy
enough<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.630> that's<00:01:59.899> bouncing<00:02:00.290> around<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
enough so that's bouncing around and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.679 
enough so that's bouncing around and
you've<00:02:01.399> actually<00:02:01.580> come<00:02:02.030> up<00:02:02.060> with<00:02:02.180> engineering

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
you've actually come up with engineering

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.570 
you've actually come up with engineering
solutions<00:02:03.080> work<00:02:03.229> absolutely<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.399> don't

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
solutions work absolutely and we don't

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.430 
solutions work absolutely and we don't
let<00:02:04.670> things<00:02:04.850> leave<00:02:05.240> unless<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.049> audio

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
let things leave unless the audio

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.309 
let things leave unless the audio
quality<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.490> construction<00:02:08.479> quality<00:02:09.080> is

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
quality and the construction quality is

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.350 
quality and the construction quality is
top-notch<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.310> that's<00:02:10.429> exactly<00:02:10.640> what<00:02:11.000> we<00:02:11.090> try

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
top-notch and that's exactly what we try

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.059 
top-notch and that's exactly what we try
to<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.380> what's<00:02:12.560> nice<00:02:12.680> about<00:02:12.739> this

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
to do and and what's nice about this

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.190

integrated stylus that's correct yeah
actually<00:02:50.299> what<00:02:50.420> we've<00:02:50.540> done<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.840> we've

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
actually what we've done is we've

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.660 
actually what we've done is we've
decided<00:02:51.319> not<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.620> put<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> stylist<00:02:52.400> or<00:02:52.519> a
