00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.429

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.870
 video on youtube channel you mean 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:17.010
 Introducing butterfly trainer from Vori 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:21.300
 I have it by nature has 40 euros 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.680
 tasted and comes from china from the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.760
 brand before 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.539
 I do the one you have to have one like that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.630
 load out and in here 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:39.120
 plastic bag I'm off 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.030
 Aluminum but I believe that the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 Be color because the mistake smells itself 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.260
 after steel and is magnetic that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 aluminum he does not fairer there 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.840
 short films pack in and catch the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 then six of course have space for 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.710
 The after trainer he is very beautiful 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.200
 Here he sees something black that is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 from the screw fuse why the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.280
 Later there are bands room 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 he has a weight of 90 grams what the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.869
 purchase price is inhaled can then is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.659
 exactly after I measured with 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.119
 the one on and in chile 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 he works a little bit off here 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.390
 But this looks like everything here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.350
 Metal is already a few days 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.640
 subtitled few days and the touch is 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 now no longer as strong as all 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 At the beginning we see the coach 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.100
 with the weapons here that's a nice one 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 design I think here are still half 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 full 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.540
 and here a number and violations children 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 yes, these people are here 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 should break points so that prevents 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.270
 be that you create the things because 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 we we try the small to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.850
 the sounds will break through 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.600
 This is to be built exactly 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.440
 works I have no idea but 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.150
 is tennant work 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.340
 screw fuse why if you with 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.530
 The trainer once flies around one 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.740
 the screws lure all day long 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.570
 pretty and yes, that's what's waiting here 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.790
 something but not so bad is that 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.920
 worst is the handle of your company 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.510
 could gea and the screws and old 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.450
 I was born around, yes , then again 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.450
 for fear examined would then have the times here 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.890
 screw down and then into the thread 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.140
 unscrew from screw fuse 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.800
 enter because we screw together 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.709
 but what made him think that he was not too tight 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.900
 screwed together because then because of itself 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.250
 the handles do not feel right anymore and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.860
 then you can no longer to flip it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.780
 use then I want to show times 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.370
 that is with the but by the way 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.190
 I would also like to say something, it is 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.880
 at a recession practical trainer 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.730
 and he wrote that on 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.620
 start the rivets and everything in these 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.989
 are they pulled tight 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.580
 which I do not find so I have 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.049
 unpacked and was from the beginning 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.170
 great to mend 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:45.680
 So I understand now I hope 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.680
 the 19th 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:04:03.639
 here has the collateral right 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.959
 Rhine whose critics from again 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.030
 is really a mistake only costs one 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.969
 screw securing and content 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.919
 to buy at 5 40 euros for a coach 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:23.229
 out and as I said I think 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:26.289
 he is really crazy about this trio 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.729
 So you will play with these trainers 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.539
 news from me still very much 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.169
 while i still have that tutorials in the 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.330
 you show us tricks or do you 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.270
 other year or us for example 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.720
 even some basics brought to 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.720
 patch 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.520
 that was my first video on youtube 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.139
 so indulgent me and write 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.150
 A comment that I do not like that 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.300
 fit has to do something even better 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.300
 could
