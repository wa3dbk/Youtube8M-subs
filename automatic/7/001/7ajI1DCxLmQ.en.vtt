00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.439
 Hello how are you I want this time 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.480
 share a biblical game that 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:16.139
 had said that he was preparing it and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 I already have it ready so this is this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.640
 Biblical game is for minors or young people 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 twinks suitable for adults and is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 very simple what you need is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 a bottle is a bottle rather that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 is what I have is a boat that I 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 recycle and it 's very simple decorate it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.500
 so that it is something beautiful not that they have 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.910
 the kids that that attractive and let me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.910
 show them I have one here 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.250
 is this 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.520
 where I bought nuts and what I did 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.180
 was to cover the label with a paper and 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.970
 then also on the lid I stuck a 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.800
 circle and a flower and I put here a 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.070
 ribbon etcetera then here is a 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.990
 space to write in what game it is or 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.940
 what is a biblical activity 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.060
 truth and then we're going to separate the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.150
 group of children or children a family 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 if you have one you love a child and you want 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.650
 play this game with with your child what 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.420
 can do then are you to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.009
 adapt it and prepare yourself 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.960
 the pieces of paper that are going to go in here 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.920
 I'm going to explain what it is 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 game 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.610
 we are going to need 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.390
 here it is here I wrote it if it is for a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 large group of young people or minors what 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.850
 we can do is divide the group in two 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 smaller groups and then each 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.010
 group either left and right truth 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.370
 a group of I do not know ten children each each 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.360
 side 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.360
 we are going to divide it into teams of two or 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.940
 more people and these two people will go 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.010
 taking turns ordering appointments 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.410
 biblical contents contained in our 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.010
 container what we are going to put here is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.870
 let's say in individual papers we're going to 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.750
 write let's say the ten 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.330
 commandments then a piece of paper goes to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.850
 be the one for the number one commandment 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.800
 and another piece of paper will be for the second 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.410
 commandment another piece of paper for the third 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.650
 commandment and so on let's go to 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.660
 can put here also some psalm 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.600
 let's say some well-known being let's say 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.710
 Psalm 51 Psalm 1 Psalm 23 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.260
 psalm 91 what do I know and the same in each 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.500
 individual piece of paper is written every 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.750
 verse and so we can have here 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.930
 blessings commandments some 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.840
 psalm the message to the seven churches in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.710
 end since we have here all the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.959
 pieces of paper by the way this can be a 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.440
 additional or previous egg in which all 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.660
 children write the little notes that go 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.750
 to go in here true or yourself 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.020
 without needing to be yourself put here 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.110
 and its little pieces the lid that are 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.690
 folded the pieces of paper we shook them and 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.810
 then we are going to 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.500
 call our groups and we have here 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.370
 then already our father the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.860
 messages from the seven churches 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.740
 Beatitudes and everything here and now 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.790
 let's do a competition either 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.800
 individual for a family or the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.630
 competition in groups of two if we have 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.040
 a large group of young people or children 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.960
 truth and let's then see who 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.390
 can work more quickly is going to 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.730
 win the person or team that can 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.960
 order all appointments correctly 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.170
 biblical more quickly swims the rules 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.480
 Note that they are not participating 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.120
 allows to use the bible or any other 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.130
 type of notes or notes or anything like that 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.330
 no other help has to be everything 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 individual and memory should be made 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.430
 of memory and individually or only 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.090
 among the members of the team that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.840
 is competing 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.900
 it gets very entertaining is quite useful 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.770
 because it helps and stimulates children to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.770
 memorize biblical passages and also 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.620
 it's a very entertaining way for them 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.260
 to be refreshing their memory if they 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.930
 they already memorized this when they were more 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.910
 small truth then I invite you to 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.210
 that you do it for a while 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.720
 very nice with the children and if they have 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.940
 some other idea or questions get into the 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.900
 blog that having a comment and with 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.140
 very happy 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.270
 we attend to what you have to 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.440
