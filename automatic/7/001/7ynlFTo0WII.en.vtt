got<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> circle<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.530> going

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
got is a circle and I you're not going

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.780 
got is a circle and I you're not going
to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:55.979> sure<00:01:56.009> you're<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.700> able

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to be I'm sure you're not gonna be able

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.600 
to be I'm sure you're not gonna be able
to<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.140> control<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.430> mouse

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to see that but I can control the mouse

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.609 
to see that but I can control the mouse
cursor<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> circle

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
cursor is here can you see the circle

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.039 
cursor is here can you see the circle
it's<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> difficult<00:02:02.880> let<00:02:03.240> me<00:02:03.329> let<00:02:03.960> me

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it's kind of difficult let me let me

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.730 
it's kind of difficult let me let me
actually<00:02:04.200> change<00:02:04.969> what<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.600> tool<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
actually change what my tool is going to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.589 
actually change what my tool is going to
be<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.069> was<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.610> chalk<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
be I was on chalk but I'm going to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.680 
be I was on chalk but I'm going to
switch<00:02:09.810> over<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> paint<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.770> I'm<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.550> to

is<00:02:16.620> red<00:02:17.040> paint<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:18.720> i'm<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.350> trail

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
is red paint and now i'm going to trail

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.080 
is red paint and now i'm going to trail
off<00:02:21.050> applying<00:02:22.050> less<00:02:22.320> pressure<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.090> less

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
pressure sensitivity I can also adjust

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
pressure sensitivity I can also adjust
it<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.530> inside<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.070> application<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.540> can

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it here inside the application and I can

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
it here inside the application and I can
go<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.400> find<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.610> cursor

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
go in and see if i can find my cursor

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.360 
go in and see if i can find my cursor
again<00:02:39.270> since<00:02:39.930> I've<00:02:40.050> got<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> I've<00:02:40.830> got<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
again since I've got it I've got it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.210 
again since I've got it I've got it
dimmed<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.740> see<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
dimmed now so that you can see it it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.530 
dimmed now so that you can see it it's
difficult<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.730> me<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.970> see<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.300> miss

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
difficult for me to see if you miss

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.930 
difficult for me to see if you miss
close<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.730> paint

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
close and I can go in and paint

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510 
close and I can go in and paint
something<00:02:48.180> else<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.750> nice<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> turquoise

ball and then the cool thing is to you
see<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.540> gonna<00:02:54.630> work<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:55.200> gonna<00:02:55.410> can

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
see see this is gonna work I'm gonna can

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.790 
see see this is gonna work I'm gonna can
you<00:02:56.250> guys<00:02:56.400> detect<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> texture<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:58.110> at<00:02:58.590> all

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you guys detect the texture there at all

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.270 
you guys detect the texture there at all
oh<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.400> probably<00:03:00.030> way<00:03:00.240> too<00:03:00.270> close<00:03:00.950> all<00:03:01.950> right<00:03:02.130> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
oh I probably way too close all right I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.800 
oh I probably way too close all right I
did<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.670> wait<00:03:02.850> wait<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.090> close<00:03:03.270> gotta<00:03:03.570> zoom<00:03:03.690> out

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
did I wait wait you close gotta zoom out

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250 
did I wait wait you close gotta zoom out
again<00:03:04.430> there's<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.520> texture<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.720> artrage

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
again there's a texture to it in artrage

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.040 
again there's a texture to it in artrage
there<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.430> kind<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.700> see<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.720> it's

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
there you can kind of see it so it's

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.070 
there you can kind of see it so it's
like<00:03:10.290> paint<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:10.980> being<00:03:11.280> splashed<00:03:11.730> upon<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
like paint is being splashed upon the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.620 
like paint is being splashed upon the
screen<00:03:13.320> it's<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.400> neat<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:15.330> are<00:03:15.480> other

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
different types of drawing devices here

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.090 
different types of drawing devices here
in<00:03:19.709> ArtRage<00:03:20.670> including<00:03:21.270> chalk<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:22.530> see

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
in ArtRage including chalk which see
