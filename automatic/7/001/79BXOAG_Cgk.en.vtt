 settlement norman then here actually 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 there are three settlements nearby we will 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.270
 break up 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.060
 supports protect and the result will be 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.789
 very generally worthy 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.280
 settlement oh well the city itself 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.380
 mixer while this mario steam 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.149
 fitting 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 city walls for now 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.140
 in the city is not only a platform 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.160
 others where I actually now and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.399
 I am going to this place of the future 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.399
 cities 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.440
 quite nice so immediately with 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 career places told more 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.930
 Getting started The project will be the rules 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.080
 project building are made in the style 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.510
 Steampunk actually did not call from here 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.340
 me to be more precise is a test 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.070
 valve because much attention 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.410
 devotes all and electricity and until steel 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 already also gave it no earlier steampunk 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.520
 such a train 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.220
 production machine including 1 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.920
 block you will enter decorative 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.250
 built decorations for 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.030
 so that she was maximally 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.530
 fit the style there 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.740
 certain presentation like this 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.780
 do so we teach so to all 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.700
 discussed in any case but many 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.710
 block you built too possible as 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.220
 knit it so that the leg will throw out 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.470
 very real or no style 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.490
 steampunk means one of the important rules 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.530
 them whose is a bunch of technology and 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.810
 bills in a red box 9 by 9 this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.230
 a little bit not our task for us to build 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 big beautiful city space but 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 the card is all the jungle and here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.129
 starting here 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.769
 basalt and right up to the snow biome it 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.629
 all being city it is not clear what village 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.060
 of millionaires do not destroy the opposite 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.980
 maintain protect it on the inhabitants 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 of our future city ​​we are then city ​​3 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.410
 the village organically entered the city therefore 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.409
 it will be interesting for sure it will not be a big deal 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.019
 the city is still inhabited city seems to me 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.650
 wonderful clear before 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.840
 scale build basement going and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.609
 I considered open as initiatives but in 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.879
 principle in principle other green 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.099
 hierarchies i'm serving as mayor of a city talking 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.980
 what to do, I will naturally listen 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.579
 your wishes, but here you are and wants something 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 that's all right in its own way then this is not anyone 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:35.760
 can make minecraft server on 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.160
 server installed but all boxed with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.510
 crafting closed 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.790
 own set for technical 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.269
 Denis tasks 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.459
 holds in the near future perspective 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.830
 these translate now but we build 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.540
 any 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.720
 something very interesting but project 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.430
 buns later so mainstream career 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.410
 understandably need to coordinate a career 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.360
 decorate just to make it 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:06.209
 looked like a career only houses 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:09.150
 cooking railway is beautiful what 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.640
 it is impossible to dig further in the city 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.160
 film cap city and surface on 3 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.790
 block revision from the city surface 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.829
 there will be a metro sewage with 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.520
 water therefore laid 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.400
 don't dig don't break up standing 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.849
 Well, while portal gun we cover 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.210
