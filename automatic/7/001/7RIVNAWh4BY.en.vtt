00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.070
 Eleventh man 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.839
 It's like I'm here because I can't run with my amp 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.839
 I did 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 Further place 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.210
 In addition to being a traveler 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.960
 Also supports the director 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.260
 I thought about my grandmother 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 It is possible 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 There were a lot of makers doing Aicola et al. 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.080
 Sales talk 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.180
 In the lecture 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.330
 7 days actually open 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.200
 It is 508 people of May 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 on the other hand 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800
 I really want to do it now 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 An example of hitting this trial 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 It is assumed that you came from here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.690
 It gets round like this 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.990
 On the other hand 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 I spoke to a donut shape 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 Sweets are noticeable 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.540
 Then the side of lawmakers 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 Is it paired with this 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 These left 5th place 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.060
 Here there was a scene of op 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 Go into talks 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.419
 Only 99% of the appeal that has become regular since summer 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.069
 One of the books 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.959
 Do you have that? 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.309
 Other than this 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 We use reasonable price without saying too much 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 The manufacturer there 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.809
 One minute 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.699
 It was said that it was motive 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.559
 This is quaint again 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.259
 See you again 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.169
 Advertising 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.349
 It is bad for general customers before this goal 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.119
 Nikopuri book decided 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.849
 The old of 1996 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.049
 Mountain bike pack 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.739
 The power of appearances during the year 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 It is difficult to say whether it is distributed to many sales 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.189
 Isn't it open? 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.909
 Until 2nd day 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.389
 Two places in front or two places in one place 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.389
 Match Uchida Nana 5 is 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:23.899
 This is called 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.479
 It seems to be lying down 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.479
 I think there is also a performance 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.789
 from then 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.599
 Konara's best in Tohoku 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.029
 However there is 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.469
 There was a heart without permission 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 I talked to this voice loudly in Japan for several years 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.359
 There are many issues in Mishima 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.569
 Then there are a lot of remaining discrepancies 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.309
 I took a department store 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.309
 1112 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
 Specific function 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.329
 It seems that I lost 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.329
 Conservative 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.869
 Baba utilization 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.750
 On the other hand, there was coverage but it was not so sweet 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.669
 Ambiguous 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.990
 It's all about it 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.539
 Tick ​​mountain 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.620
 After all 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.409
 Among the Katsuta 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.409
 Pointed out that it is a sufficient experience 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.759
 each 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.759
 There was a manufacturer that was losing 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.340
 There was a purpose for life 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.430
 Beckoning cat time measurement 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.520
 Wait for the first advance to Japan 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.620
 Hong Kong escape 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.349
 Stay Flashback 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.349
 There are also people 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.689
 Capital is after 1 billion yen bubble 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.930
 Much less than this 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.930
 Most district court first trial 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120
 It is the first time for the first time in earning 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.910
 Up to 9th 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.639
 But the BOJ will raise interest rates 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.879
 What I thought about the car 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.559
 Kondo Showa 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.559
 Is that okay? 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.559
 In fact 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.099
 Economic downturn 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.959
 I was repelled to see if there should be a merit for the next season 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.959
 but 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.819
 Not what the thing 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.550
 Because it was a track competition 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.039
 Not Fujitsu 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.039
 Chinese light greatly increase 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.819
 On the contrary keep the course 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.029
 There is also a period 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.259
 If you don't have a formwork to use on a hit mountain bike 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.400
 Akihabara 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 Marry everyone 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.379
 Timing and Germany 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.610
 Acca does not know 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.629
 White as timing takes 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.629
 Every time I made a pledge, I extended it every time 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.789
 Because I use it 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.409
 Meryl is very good 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:44.499
 There is a good place 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.430
 May be 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.330
 It was not discovered during the Tanaka period 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.909
 It is interesting because there are countries 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.229
 Japan's oldest 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.379
 Therefore it is not a book 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.710
 there 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.400
 This is also Imada
