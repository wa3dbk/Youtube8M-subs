your leg eyes this is common due to
popular<00:00:17.500> request<00:00:17.740> I<00:00:18.040> thought<00:00:18.220> I'd<00:00:18.340> go<00:00:18.490> ahead

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
popular request I thought I'd go ahead

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.730 
popular request I thought I'd go ahead
and<00:00:18.700> make<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.330> video<00:00:19.630> covering<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.320> bulk<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.680> my

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
and make a video covering the bulk of my

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.010 
and make a video covering the bulk of my
macros<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:21.550> did<00:00:21.730> make<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.910> macro<00:00:22.180> video<00:00:22.540> around<00:00:22.810> a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
macros I did make a macro video around a

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.929 
macros I did make a macro video around a
year<00:00:23.350> ago<00:00:23.619> now<00:00:23.860> but<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.520> pretty<00:00:24.700> outdated

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
year ago now but it is pretty outdated

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.760 
year ago now but it is pretty outdated
and<00:00:25.420> it<00:00:25.540> didn't<00:00:25.750> quite<00:00:25.840> cover<00:00:26.140> things<00:00:26.500> with

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
and it didn't quite cover things with

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.230 
and it didn't quite cover things with
much<00:00:26.980> depth<00:00:27.340> so<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.790> is<00:00:27.910> gonna<00:00:28.060> be<00:00:28.150> an

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
much depth so this is gonna be an

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.359 
much depth so this is gonna be an
updated<00:00:28.630> version<00:00:28.810> don't<00:00:29.470> expect<00:00:29.770> any<00:00:29.980> insane

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
updated version don't expect any insane

revolutionary<00:00:31.150> macros<00:00:31.539> here<00:00:31.660> by<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.930> way

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
revolutionary macros here by the way

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.990 
revolutionary macros here by the way
these<00:00:32.230> are<00:00:32.440> just<00:00:32.619> macros<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.070> feel<00:00:33.280> suit<00:00:33.550> me<00:00:33.760> and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
these are just macros I feel suit me and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700 
these are just macros I feel suit me and
I<00:00:34.390> could<00:00:34.629> help<00:00:34.840> out<00:00:34.989> someone<00:00:35.230> who<00:00:35.379> is<00:00:35.500> maybe

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
I could help out someone who is maybe

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.740 
I could help out someone who is maybe
less<00:00:36.010> experienced<00:00:36.820> with<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.270> basics<00:00:37.629> of

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
less experienced with the basics of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.390 
less experienced with the basics of
macros<00:00:38.080> all<00:00:38.379> right<00:00:38.530> so<00:00:38.680> first<00:00:38.830> off<00:00:39.100> I'm<00:00:39.250> gonna

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
macros all right so first off I'm gonna

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.619 
macros all right so first off I'm gonna
go<00:00:39.550> through<00:00:39.730> at<00:00:39.820> macros<00:00:40.180> like<00:00:40.300> Villa

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
go through at macros like Villa

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.270 
go through at macros like Villa
essential<00:00:41.290> to<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.500> wallet<00:00:41.769> class<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.220> I'm

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
essential to the wallet class and I'm

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.310 
essential to the wallet class and I'm
pretty<00:00:42.430> sure<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.699> similar<00:00:43.150> macros<00:00:43.690> can<00:00:43.720> be<00:00:44.110> made

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
pretty sure a similar macros can be made

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.200 
pretty sure a similar macros can be made
or<00:00:44.530> most<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.220> other<00:00:45.370> classes<00:00:45.640> as<00:00:45.940> well

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
or most of the other classes as well

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.510 
or most of the other classes as well
first<00:00:46.630> off<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.079> macro<00:00:47.620> every<00:00:48.040> wallet<00:00:48.370> should

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
first off a macro every wallet should

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.880 
first off a macro every wallet should
have<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.210> big<00:00:49.570> ass<00:00:49.780> heels<00:00:50.110> macro<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.800> this

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
have is the big ass heels macro and this

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.010 
have is the big ass heels macro and this
macros<00:00:51.250> pretty<00:00:51.489> basic<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:52.030> but<00:00:52.570> important

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
macros pretty basic and but important

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.630 
macros pretty basic and but important
nonetheless<00:00:53.079> it<00:00:53.860> combines<00:00:54.280> your<00:00:54.399> dark

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
nonetheless it combines your dark

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.280 
nonetheless it combines your dark
regeneration<00:00:55.180> ability<00:00:55.690> with<00:00:55.870> your<00:00:56.050> health

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
regeneration ability with your health

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.930 
regeneration ability with your health
stone<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.309> reason<00:00:57.520> that<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:57.700> is<00:00:57.760> so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
stone and the reason that this is so

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.729 
stone and the reason that this is so
important<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.600> that<00:00:58.629> dark<00:00:58.960> region<00:00:59.350> as<00:00:59.500> well<00:00:59.620> as

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
important is that dark region as well as

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.440 
important is that dark region as well as
healing<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.250> increases<00:01:01.030> your<00:01:01.149> healing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
healing you increases your healing

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.869 
healing you increases your healing
received<00:01:01.750> by<00:01:01.870> 25%<00:01:02.770> while<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.250> active<00:01:03.700> so<00:01:03.730> it

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
received by 25% while it is active so it

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.279 
received by 25% while it is active so it
essentially<00:01:04.330> makes<00:01:04.449> your<00:01:04.660> health<00:01:04.869> stone<00:01:05.080> here

be used separately I personally would

pretty standard focus fear macro and if
you<00:01:19.330> aren't<00:01:19.600> using<00:01:19.690> arena<00:01:20.140> target<00:01:20.590> one<00:01:20.830> two

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.690 
and three macros like I'm not focus
macros<00:01:23.530> are<00:01:23.679> gonna<00:01:23.860> be<00:01:24.009> your<00:01:24.160> best<00:01:24.310> friend<00:01:24.550> in

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
macros are gonna be your best friend in

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.669 
macros are gonna be your best friend in
arenas<00:01:25.119> as<00:01:25.270> well<00:01:25.390> as<00:01:25.509> being<00:01:25.660> pretty<00:01:26.170> useful<00:01:26.530> in

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
arenas as well as being pretty useful in

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.589 
arenas as well as being pretty useful in
battlegrounds<00:01:27.160> well<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:28.000> any<00:01:28.179> focused

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:28.599 
battlegrounds well and like any focused

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.180 
battlegrounds well and like any focused
Tiger<00:01:28.750> macro<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.349> pretty<00:01:29.649> much<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:29.830> makes

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
Tiger macro it pretty much just makes

the ability hit your focus target

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.839 
the ability hit your focus target

macro as well so the idea behind it is
simple<00:05:31.680> really<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.130> include<00:05:32.460> everything

that increases your damage to the macro

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.310 
that increases your damage to the macro
and<00:05:35.430> use<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.090> Mongol<00:05:36.539> people<00:05:36.870> down<00:05:37.080> when

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
and use it to Mongol people down when

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.170 
and use it to Mongol people down when
the<00:05:37.410> opportunity<00:05:37.979> presents<00:05:38.190> itself<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.940> that
