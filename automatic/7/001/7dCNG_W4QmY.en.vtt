 Let's talk about actors and actresses a lot. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 similar to each other with the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 other guys this is a bar talk 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 of the club including the idea to do 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.070
 This video was seated with friends. 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.680
 dude dude 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 so everyone loves to make comparisons 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.489
 O myself want to see how many people have 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 was four actors including that I went 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 with the note are two actors and a singer 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 people already told me that I look like 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 I do not think much more I look 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.890
 much with korn davi from file x 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 and it looks crazy several times is a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 shopping botnet boat then he is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 drunk and I said look what else girls are going 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.200
 stare at the team now all 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 hair already has a time 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.549
 Maybe it 's maybe not from when I did 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.260
 My mother is a play I was with. 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 that black hair on the side maybe 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.630
 it seemed a bit more but I think 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.580
 does not seem 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 I do not know, you think it looks different 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 Comparison that I do boxing for guys 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.729
 boxing sandri that does not look in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 But it's only because she's blond and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.900
 shaggy hair that's clear 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.979
 classical comparison of the 1980s with 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.500
 singer same thing just because it's blonde 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.920
 roberto leal ae 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 ae 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 but let's start talking about the actors and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 actresses you know the actor jeff dinho 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.830
 he was the protagonist of a seventh 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.040
 sonni band he also did many 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.439
 holdings in arce assai and all 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.780
 things most of the year 90 and beginning of 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.340
 2006 many participations he did 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 participation in bonn that these things 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 all 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.890
 Who do you think he looks like? 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.989
 to me it's like this 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.269
 else we boot in the comments 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.390
 I did not find anything like this 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.610
 here is very much like this type or 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.640
 put the comment and if you miss it too 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.319
 is one is that I put load 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.330
 average in the comments who knows us 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.260
 do not do another video to part 2 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.540
 a part 3 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.180
 but then dude I think df seems 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.970
 very ravious run very very 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.750
 well not much is not much like 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.090
 what do you think? 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 let's talk now of the mark strong know 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.190
 that the mark strong and facilitated enough 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.910
 movie 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.000
 he including the blackwood lord of the ice 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 homes face to me he looks very much like 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.239
 It's from Garcia, man. 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.900
 What do you think, one more guy, I? 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.269
 I think jeff bridges looks a lot like 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 kurt russel at some point is that 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.019
 thing for now is also you see if 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 demand is taken some photos are the movies 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.910
 which are more similar but have face 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.630
 have pictures that look very expensive 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.459
 too much 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.890
 one more act that I like a lot is good is 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.720
 Fan of the guy for me he seems a lot 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.820
 The guy who came to the movies 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 promote know a war 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.720
 His character always dies, I guess. 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 that he remembers what you think is expensive 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.709
 now two more actors coast to be 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.609
 very unique not by famous cangaceiro 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.380
 for millions of movies and the gamewise 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.329
 kahlenberg six hunters of emotions that 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.549
 causes pain and emotion in the decade of motions 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.920
 cause of the emotion with which rivers complete 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.980
 what swayze looks like, does not look like 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.459
 Now you're going to screw because it's but it has 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.060
 similarity face the lori river the doctor 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.819
 Casa, Lar 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.950
 I think it sounds like a lot to who the game 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.590
 of thrones there knows who it is 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.019
 Peter Ording Cleide gives a heads-up look 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.209
 on the face it looks like it has a great movie 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.880
 French called the untouchables I think 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.590
 everyone has seen and has a French actor 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.390
 It's the fans, the act z face was there for me but 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.770
 I think a lot like the west 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.510
 informs you that you 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.220
 now a comparison of an actor 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.890
 Hollywood with the Brazilian needs 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.960
 Tell you who it is, it's not the dance to here. 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.300
 inside is great tuba dance that looks like 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.800
 Who told henn that he looks like this right now? 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.180
 today it is not heard by anything that has 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.340
 tom had hanks also gave a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.970
 but I think it seems 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.760
 A lot, it's katy perry, you crossed it and let me 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.920
 passing in the para also seems now two 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 guys who look really great orson wells 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.970
 I think it's sensational even the talk 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.410
 of the conaci was about our morality after 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.480
 about citizen who 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.160
 I think the organ looks very 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.210
 true because it does not seem to thrill 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.640
 in front 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.340
 so I'll talk about jack black here jack 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.440
 black looks very well that honor 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.340
 flat thing a photo similar to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.080
 those things more 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.360
 I think jack black has got a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.120
 resemblance to the Roman guy and the free 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 sobiech that 300 years ago 90 until half 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.690
 gone now but she was doing 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.270
 a lot in the 90's 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.100
 face is much the same as relaunching me 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.990
 I was impressed and already speaks to us is 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.990
 as if it were the young version of the elegant 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:13.110
 plus one years old 60/70 bad stigma 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.690
 6777 that 50 or 60 years 60 and 70 and expensive 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.210
 For me daniel craig looks a lot like 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.850
 the stigma that in much the hair style 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.680
 all eyes these two are more or less 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.840
 But I think there's a similarity to you. 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.480
 how to say ralph fiennes 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.970
 I acted I think something I do not know 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.460
 tell you mimi puts the comments have 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.880
 something Brazil and turkey and they are 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.270
 Looks like something does not look like I 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.520
 I think it looks like classic grace kelly 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.920
 gata nicole kidman 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.080
 I do not have a likeness either. 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.330
 abandoned and also climbed at least I 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.890
 I have not seen anything he did is the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.840
 medical checkup that whole thing there 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.290
 It looks very much like josh charles guy who 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.570
 he also asks that his art reminds him that 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.670
 he in the end is villain he did inclusively 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.500
 society of the dead poets did not even 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.800
 two that I think have a similarity 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.280
 The same as hell is the trash and see what 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.870
 I even think it hurts and I 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.130
 I think he 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.100
 doing a lot of success now that I 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.560
 says a plan and it's not like it's not like this 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.140
 very like face is not but there are some 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.530
 thing that although you think 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.810
 And to close, there's a guy that sometimes I 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.060
 I think it's a lot like sometimes I 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.130
 I think you do not remember so much it's the 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.620
 column I'll start with him but 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.270
 because I think it 's more a style 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.670
 Maybe I'll show the two of them. 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.310
 without realizing why george clooney 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.950
 tepco early 50s already and and always 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.320
 this hair is circled in it always 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.030
 So great, well dressed tent, he is 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.920
 like I said he has a beauty that I 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.380
 I say it's classic it's expensive it kind 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.270
 medicine every 50 years he makes one 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.820
 show his face has an older face 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.730
 of classic day and it is many 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.320
 Sometimes he brings me back to Kelly's. 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.970
 singing in the rain 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.490
 So I do not know if they might be too 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.250
 similar or not is the square face or 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.990
 simply because they are similar in style 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.120
 of a classic thing know that 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.780
 Hair that way and be a beauty. 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.030
 classic 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.060
 the dike also had a neighbor 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.400
 So you know, I know, man, but for me. 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.150
 Remember one another, the two remind me of 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.410
 two reminds me of a meaning to the sentence to 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.180
 me both look alike 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.800
 Magali, that's what I wanted to thank you. 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.880
