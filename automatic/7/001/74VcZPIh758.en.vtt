00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
and he always seems it's sublime against

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.199 
and he always seems it's sublime against
the<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.030> important<00:02:59.450> CJ<00:02:59.870> he<00:03:00.109> gave<00:03:00.379> you<00:03:01.209> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
unpredictable which is always impossible

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.390 
unpredictable which is always impossible
