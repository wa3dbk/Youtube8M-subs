pretty neat that they give you an extra

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.750 
pretty neat that they give you an extra
ring<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.440> here<00:01:35.800> so<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:36.100> get<00:01:36.250> two<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.490> those

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
ring in here so you get two of those

ring in here so you get two of those
pretty<00:01:37.210> neat<00:01:37.360> okay<00:01:38.020> onto<00:01:38.590> bag<00:01:39.100> number<00:01:39.400> two

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
pretty neat okay onto bag number two

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.170 
pretty neat okay onto bag number two
okay<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.740> have<00:01:41.950> finished<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.640> bottom<00:01:42.940> section

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
okay we have finished the bottom section

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.060 
okay we have finished the bottom section

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
which I think takes the most amount of

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
which I think takes the most amount of
time<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.790> most<00:01:45.909> amount<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.210> pieces

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
time and the most amount of pieces

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.870 
time and the most amount of pieces
primarily<00:01:47.770> because<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.159> all<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> the

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
atmosphere I guess and of course on the

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.630 
atmosphere I guess and of course on the
inside<00:02:21.609> here<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.269> have<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.519> part<00:02:24.519> where

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
for whatever reason Lego likes to put

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.219 
for whatever reason Lego likes to put
those<00:03:14.290> rodents<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.950> here<00:03:15.159> so<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.139> of

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
those rodents in here so and then of

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.369 
those rodents in here so and then of
course<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.530> walkout<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:19.260> kitchen<00:03:20.260> area

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
course the walkout to the kitchen area

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.110 
course the walkout to the kitchen area
okay<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:20.829> that's<00:03:21.159> it<00:03:21.400> that's<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.849> bottom

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
okay so that's it that's the bottom

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.280 
okay so that's it that's the bottom
level<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.769> we're<00:03:23.769> gonna<00:03:23.859> move<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
level and we're gonna move on to the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
level and we're gonna move on to the
second<00:03:26.680> level<00:03:26.829> which<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.400> think<00:03:27.609> hopefully

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
second level which I think hopefully

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.210 
second level which I think hopefully
shouldn't<00:03:28.540> be<00:03:28.629> as<00:03:28.780> involved<00:03:29.049> as<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.409> one<00:03:29.620> but

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
shouldn't be as involved as this one but

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.930 
shouldn't be as involved as this one but
it's<00:03:30.940> looking<00:03:31.090> pretty<00:03:31.239> good<00:03:32.609> okay<00:03:33.609> we<00:03:33.760> just

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
it's looking pretty good okay we just

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.520 
it's looking pretty good okay we just
got<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> second<00:03:34.569> level<00:03:34.720> completed<00:03:35.109> here<00:03:35.349> now

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
got the second level completed here now

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.000 
got the second level completed here now

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
