00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.440 
allow for a little bit longer runtime
hopefully<00:02:21.069> with<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> next<00:02:21.610> Nexus<00:02:21.940> 5<00:02:22.209> they

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
hopefully with the next Nexus 5 they

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.800 
hopefully with the next Nexus 5 they
will<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:23.080> battery<00:02:23.739> capacity<00:02:23.980> from<00:02:24.810> 2300

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
will the battery capacity from 2300

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.369 
will the battery capacity from 2300
though<00:02:26.310> which<00:02:27.310> shows<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> bit<00:02:28.030> low<00:02:28.299> but<00:02:28.629> other

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
though which shows a bit low but other

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.520 
though which shows a bit low but other
than<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.620> we're<00:02:30.010> also<00:02:30.129> getting<00:02:30.519> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
than that we're also getting the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.470 
than that we're also getting the
enhanced<00:02:32.530> permissions<00:02:33.069> here<00:02:33.579> so<00:02:33.940> if<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.269> go

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
enhanced permissions here so if you go

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
enhanced permissions here so if you go
to<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.310> app<00:02:36.489> permissions<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.690> basically

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to the app permissions you can basically

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.000 
to the app permissions you can basically
cut<00:02:39.220> off<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.720> privacy<00:02:41.230> issues<00:02:41.769> you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
cut off the like privacy issues you

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.330 
cut off the like privacy issues you
might<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.940> worried<00:02:43.239> about<00:02:43.540> such<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.590> eBay

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
might be worried about such as on eBay

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.900 
might be worried about such as on eBay
for<00:02:45.609> example<00:02:46.299> or<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> camera<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.579> well

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
for example or like the camera as well

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.339 
for example or like the camera as well
as<00:02:49.000> chrome<00:02:49.359> can<00:02:50.109> turn<00:02:50.410> off<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.370> allow

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
as chrome can turn off the allow

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.710 
as chrome can turn off the allow
location<00:02:53.349> permission<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.299> also<00:02:55.450> turn

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
location permission you can also turn

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.270 
location permission you can also turn
off<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.140> permissions<00:02:56.709> for<00:02:56.769> example<00:02:57.220> if

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
off for the permissions for example if

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.309 
off for the permissions for example if
you<00:02:57.370> don't<00:02:57.459> want<00:02:57.670> something<00:02:57.940> using<00:02:58.690> your

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
you don't want something using your

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.520 
you don't want something using your
storage<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.569> turn<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.019> off<00:03:02.079> as<00:03:02.500> well

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
storage you can turn that off as well

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.119 
storage you can turn that off as well
very<00:03:03.220> nice<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> intricate<00:03:04.269> here<00:03:05.010> giving<00:03:06.010> you

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
very nice and intricate here giving you

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.619 
very nice and intricate here giving you
a<00:03:06.159> better<00:03:06.370> control<00:03:07.359> over<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:09.120> settings<00:03:10.120> here

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
a better control over the settings here

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.759 
a better control over the settings here
and<00:03:10.890> also<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.069> even<00:03:13.109> basically<00:03:14.109> allow<00:03:14.500> or

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
and also you can even basically allow or

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.220 
and also you can even basically allow or
disallow<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.970> modification<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.780> system

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
disallow the modification of system

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.259 
disallow the modification of system
settings<00:03:17.739> which<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.250> quite<00:03:18.549> useful<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.060> guess

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
settings which is quite useful I guess

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.440 
settings which is quite useful I guess
for<00:03:19.599> preventing<00:03:20.169> corruption

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
for preventing corruption

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.960 
for preventing corruption
so<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:23.169> actual<00:03:23.620> UI<00:03:23.829> there<00:03:24.250> are<00:03:24.370> some<00:03:24.639> slight

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
so the actual UI there are some slight

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.390 
so the actual UI there are some slight
changes<00:03:25.269> there<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.410> well<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.919> on<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
changes there as well like on the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.110 
changes there as well like on the
lockscreen

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
lockscreen

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.770 
lockscreen
you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.019> see<00:03:29.260> we<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.980> quick<00:03:30.310> access

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
you can see we do have this quick access

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.900 
you can see we do have this quick access
to<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.340> talk<00:03:33.340> talking<00:03:34.169> features<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:36.340> sofa<00:03:36.879> a

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
look at the notification shade you can

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.439 
look at the notification shade you can
see<00:03:40.120> we<00:03:40.329> do<00:03:40.480> have<00:03:40.510> do<00:03:41.019> not<00:03:41.049> disturb<00:03:41.650> here<00:03:42.579> gives

see we do have do not disturb here gives

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.199 
see we do have do not disturb here gives
you<00:03:43.540> much<00:03:43.750> more<00:03:43.980> settings<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:45.519> rules<00:03:45.819> you

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
you much more settings of what rules you

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.129 
you much more settings of what rules you
can<00:03:46.419> put<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:48.220> allow<00:03:48.519> certain<00:03:48.940> people<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
can put on to allow certain people to

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.949 
can put on to allow certain people to
contact<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.049> is<00:03:53.410> quite<00:03:54.010> good<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.959> if

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
contact you so that is quite good and if

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.220 
contact you so that is quite good and if
we<00:03:56.109> go<00:03:56.260> into<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.040> settings<00:03:57.609> as<00:03:57.819> well<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:59.019> can

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
we go into the settings as well you can

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.030 
we go into the settings as well you can
see<00:03:59.560> do<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.549> this<00:04:00.730> memory<00:04:01.209> issue<00:04:01.829> here<00:04:02.829> where

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
see do have this memory issue here where

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.659 
see do have this memory issue here where
you<00:04:03.160> can<00:04:03.489> choose<00:04:04.379> basically<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.680> app<00:04:06.129> usage

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
you can choose basically the app usage

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.960 
you can choose basically the app usage
of<00:04:06.819> memory<00:04:07.209> which<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.540> quite<00:04:08.079> better

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
of memory which is quite better

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.059 
of memory which is quite better
particularly<00:04:09.970> if<00:04:10.060> you're<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.359> lower<00:04:11.069> model

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
particularly if you're on a lower model

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.020 
particularly if you're on a lower model
with<00:04:12.310> less<00:04:12.579> memory<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.690> play<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.199> so<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:15.030> is

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
with less memory to play with so that is

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.680 
with less memory to play with so that is
pretty<00:04:16.660> good<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.260> did<00:04:17.889> do<00:04:18.130> an<00:04:18.370> answer<00:04:18.789> to<00:04:19.090> test

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
pretty good I did do an answer to test

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.100 
pretty good I did do an answer to test

the final version will be able to do a

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.809 
the final version will be able to do a
proper<00:04:54.960> test<00:04:55.960> there<00:04:56.379> so<00:04:56.740> going<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.460> take<00:04:57.639> that

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
proper test there so going to take that

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.059 
proper test there so going to take that

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
on the Nexus 5 think it's still a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.790 
on the Nexus 5 think it's still a
fantastic<00:05:08.919> little<00:05:09.430> device<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:10.500> yes<00:05:11.500> it's
