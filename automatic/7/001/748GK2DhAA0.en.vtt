00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.769
 hey people welcome I am 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.510
 daniel from daniels foto.com and today 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.850
 I want you again the difference 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.250
 between the different hd first 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.630
 fell the canon 5d mark 3 we show 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
 now have the background here 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.260
 setting sun movie I do with 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.050
 a canon 5d mark 2 and the 40mm 28 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.129
 ds tm in front of us we have the canon 5d 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:43.539
 market 3 with the 24 to 70 mm 28 l usm 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:45.519
 and let's start directly so that 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:51.219
 my settings are just what we have 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:54.219
 here 160 shutter speed aperture 8 and iso 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.909
 100 and then we catch directly too 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.749
 ever we go then hdr 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:06.070
 let on adr plus two stop wehrmann 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:08.260
 the effect on natural and then want 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.970
 every recording we speak every time 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.480
 will press the trigger immediately 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.120
 makes the camera a gentleman dr 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.270
 and we only keep the hdr 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.710
 picture and focused i am up 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 the tree in front of me 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.820
 Now I'll go to m so speak 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.510
 Now I have the focus on manual 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.150
 set sat 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.870
 the self-timer one to two seconds 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.870
 and then we start 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.730
 she made three pictures and now 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 Let's take a look at the result 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.400
 on 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.140
 yes, that would be reasonably acceptable 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.890
 I say watch us stirring the next one 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.930
 Style on 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.860
 I'll go in with the closing time 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.980
 bit down on one 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.260
 hundredth 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.460
 it will also darker and vote now 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.460
 we have the standard effect 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.760
 yes that looks okay too 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.400
 So I set now the focus of the 5d 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.680
 on the background and I'm the same 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 back so you love i'm back 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.129
 Now you see how the back 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.970
 we look forward to continue with 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.410
 the other hdr style in the case will be 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.060
 be the saturated one 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 The closing time we open now 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.910
 80 because it is getting darker and darker 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.690
 continues 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.690
 made three pictures 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.580
 that looks very good, especially because 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.540
 we still have the green field at the front 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.030
 clouds above 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.920
 yes that's pretty good I'm going now 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.660
 also a fiftieth respectively 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.030
 on a 3 system how we all that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.040
 just a little too dark 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:10.670
 Now we go to the distinctive filter 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.670
 and on you go 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.160
 so the look a bit for example 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 Dreamy from I say something real 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.810
 but not bad at least 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.670
 then we look at the last filter 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.470
 I think I have it so far 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.180
 not seen but i would say that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 Least of all fits this 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 situation because I've been talking 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.570
 or talked about this is this 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.780
 This filter is succinct that fits 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.150
 rather to the architecture photography would 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.140
 I say still make picture and 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.140
 look at us all the time 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.300
 yes, the picture has something but for 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.710
 everything affects me depending on the situation 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.610
 completely wrong I say 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.690
 looks so very grubby and that 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.090
 just does not fit the situation 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.870
 That's why I would filter the last one 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.110
 not incisive in such a situation 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.520
 recommend so I have shown you now 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.600
 anyway the filters i hope it has 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.190
 I liked you 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.190
 help and see you next time
