00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
combinational to oily skin which I have

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.560 
combinational to oily skin which I have

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
of this foundation but I think 180 sand

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.389 
of this foundation but I think 180 sand
beige<00:00:29.220> suited<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.449> quite<00:00:31.140> well<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:32.219> I've

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
beige suited me quite well because I've

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
beige suited me quite well because I've
got<00:00:32.550> yellow<00:00:32.730> undertone<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> perfect

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
got yellow undertone so this is perfect

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.869 
got yellow undertone so this is perfect
and<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.210> said<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> last<00:00:36.750> 24<00:00:37.440> hours<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.640> I'm

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and it said to last 24 hours which I'm

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
and it said to last 24 hours which I'm
not<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.480> about<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.489> lot

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
not really sure about because I do a lot

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.110 
not really sure about because I do a lot
in<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:41.910> day<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.680> usually<00:00:43.850> foundations<00:00:44.850> just

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
in my day and usually foundations just

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.600 
in my day and usually foundations just
slide<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.730> applying<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
slide off so I'm going to be applying it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
slide off so I'm going to be applying it
just<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.789> clip<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.539> hair<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.520 
just gonna clip back my hair the thing I
don't<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.860> about<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.379> there's<00:00:58.379> no

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
don't like about it it's just there's no

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
don't like about it it's just there's no
pump<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> it'd<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.870> quite<00:01:01.350> difficult<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.100> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
pump so it'd be quite difficult to get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
pump so it'd be quite difficult to get
the<00:01:02.340> product<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:06.020> only<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.290> could<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.619> a
