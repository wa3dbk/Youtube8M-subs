new<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:38.879> has<00:00:39.000> changed<00:00:39.510> since<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.840> last

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
new or what has changed since we last

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.310 
new or what has changed since we last
took<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.620> android<00:00:40.980> l<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> first<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
took a look at android l so first up the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
took a look at android l so first up the
default<00:00:43.649> launch<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.010> Android<00:00:44.250> L<00:00:44.370> has<00:00:44.489> changed

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
default launch an Android L has changed

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
default launch an Android L has changed
and<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.930> new<00:00:46.110> material<00:00:46.320> sort

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and we now have this new material sort

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.380 
and we now have this new material sort
of<00:00:47.100> design<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.700> open<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> app<00:00:48.149> drawer

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of design when you open the app drawer

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
of design when you open the app drawer
so<00:00:49.020> instead<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.649> bring<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> new

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so instead of just bring it up a new

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
so instead of just bring it up a new
screen<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.149> actually<00:00:51.360> adds<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.930> layer<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
screen it actually adds a layer of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.709 
screen it actually adds a layer of
hierarchy<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> entire<00:00:53.820> launch<00:00:54.329> itself

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
hierarchy to the entire launch itself

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
hierarchy to the entire launch itself
making<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.680> seem<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.430> apps<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
making it seem as if the apps just go

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
making it seem as if the apps just go
straight<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.530> circle

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
straight back into that little circle

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
straight back into that little circle
when<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> close<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> really

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
when you close it back so that really

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
when you close it back so that really
adds<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> material<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> feel<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
adds to the material look and feel and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
adds to the material look and feel and
design<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.809> still<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.110> exactly<00:01:04.439> too

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
design but I'm still not exactly too

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
design but I'm still not exactly too
sure<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> feel<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.030> yet<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.720> keep

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
sure how I feel about it as yet but keep

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.420 
sure how I feel about it as yet but keep
in<00:01:07.080> mind<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> final<00:01:08.130> or

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in mind that this is not the final or

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.250 
in mind that this is not the final or
finished<00:01:08.820> product<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> lot<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> things<00:01:10.080> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
finished product so a lot of things can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
finished product so a lot of things can
be<00:01:10.439> changed<00:01:10.470> before<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.100> releases<00:01:11.369> officially

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
be changed before it releases officially

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
be changed before it releases officially
the<00:01:12.780> navigation<00:01:13.320> bar<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> bottom<00:01:13.920> has<00:01:14.010> also

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the navigation bar the bottom has also

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.609 
the navigation bar the bottom has also
changed<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.909> slightly<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.080> last<00:01:16.290> time<00:01:16.470> around

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
changed but slightly so last time around

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
changed but slightly so last time around
they<00:01:16.920> were<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.340> larger<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.360> wasn't<00:01:18.540> too

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
they were a bit larger and I wasn't too

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.149 
they were a bit larger and I wasn't too
happy<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.350> looked<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.979> time

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
happy with how they looked but this time

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
happy with how they looked but this time
our<00:01:20.220> own<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.420> smaller<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
our own they are a bit smaller and just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
our own they are a bit smaller and just
small<00:01:22.619> enough<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.850> much

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
small enough to make them look much much

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
small enough to make them look much much
better<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.110> still<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.409> sure<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.710> these

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
better we are still not sure if these

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
better we are still not sure if these
are<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> final<00:01:26.280> navigation<00:01:27.000> buttons<00:01:27.270> 400l

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
are the final navigation buttons 400l

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
are the final navigation buttons 400l
but<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> smaller<00:01:28.950> size<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.460> makes<00:01:29.759> them

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
but the smaller size really makes them

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
but the smaller size really makes them
look<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.360> polished<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> now

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
look a lot more polished there is now

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
look a lot more polished there is now

on all smartphones changing users would

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
on all smartphones changing users would
just<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.649> Windows<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.159> Mac<00:01:44.220> so

every setting you change is the dot
specific<00:01:49.470> user<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> were<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> create<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
specific user so if you were to create a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
specific user so if you were to create a
guest<00:01:51.270> user<00:01:51.570> there'd<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.200> no<00:01:52.560> downloaded<00:01:53.159> apps

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
guest user there'd be no downloaded apps

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340 
guest user there'd be no downloaded apps
and<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.180> settings<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.049> basically

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and the settings would be just basically

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
and the settings would be just basically
default<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.340> come<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.610> extremely

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
default this would come in extremely

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.399 
default this would come in extremely
handy<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.079> than<00:01:58.229> one

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
handy if there are more than one

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590

person's<00:01:58.799> using<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.280> device<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.880> just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
person's using one device or just

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.940 
person's using one device or just
basically<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.049> you'd<00:02:01.200> prefer<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.649> create<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
basically if you'd prefer to create a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
basically if you'd prefer to create a

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.420 
on camera but there's a slight feedin
when<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.470> open<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.800> clock<00:04:55.980> up<00:04:56.100> for<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.340> first
