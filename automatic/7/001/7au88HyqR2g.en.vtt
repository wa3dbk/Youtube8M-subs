00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
to be honest you may think it is slow

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.250 
to be honest you may think it is slow
because<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.360> obviously<00:02:41.660> not<00:02:41.750> showing

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because it's obviously not showing

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.340 
because it's obviously not showing
exactly<00:02:42.830> what's<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:44.570> even<00:02:45.110> when

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
exactly what's going on but even when

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.580 
exactly what's going on but even when
connected<00:02:45.860> via<00:02:46.040> cable<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.750> slow<00:02:48.050> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
connected via cable it's just a slow so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.770 
connected via cable it's just a slow so
that's<00:02:49.580> really<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.060> best<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.390> do<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
that's really the best you can do and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.320 
that's really the best you can do and
besides<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.890> gives<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.280> nice<00:02:52.430> window<00:02:52.760> format

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
besides it gives it a nice window format

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.600 
besides it gives it a nice window format
and<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.990> can<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.470> over<00:02:54.620> Wi-Fi<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.400> there's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and you can do it over Wi-Fi so there's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.020 
and you can do it over Wi-Fi so there's
no<00:02:55.790> need<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.320> go<00:02:57.320> anywhere<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.760> really

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
no need to go anywhere and if you really

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.760
