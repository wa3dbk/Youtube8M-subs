pool or other uses as well I just want

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.590 
pool or other uses as well I just want
to<00:00:35.460> show<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> worked<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.420> real

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to show you how it worked it's real

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
to show you how it worked it's real
simple<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.649> does<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> an

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
simple this one does not have an

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
simple this one does not have an
integral<00:00:38.850> float<00:00:39.149> valve<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.469> needs<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
integral float valve so it it needs to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
integral float valve so it it needs to
be<00:00:41.340> manually<00:00:41.820> turned<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> off<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.440> we'll

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
be manually turned on and off so we'll

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.690 
be manually turned on and off so we'll
just<00:00:43.920> set<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:45.059> inside<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> pool<00:00:49.579> plug<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
just set it down inside the pool plug it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.700 
just set it down inside the pool plug it
in<00:00:53.629> starts<00:00:54.629> working<00:00:54.899> automatically<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in starts working automatically and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
in starts working automatically and
we're<00:00:55.829> already<00:00:55.980> pumping<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> water<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we're already pumping the water out of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.599 
we're already pumping the water out of
the<00:00:57.390> pool<00:00:57.629> we'll<00:00:58.590> pan<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> give

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the pool we'll pan over there and give

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
the pool we'll pan over there and give
you<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> shot<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> goes<00:01:02.070> pretty

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you a shot so you can see it goes pretty

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.810 
you a shot so you can see it goes pretty
quickly<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> run<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.020> while

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
quickly so you run this for a while

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.109 
quickly so you run this for a while
until<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:09.119> water<00:01:09.420> gets<00:01:09.659> down<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.170> level

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
until your water gets down to a level

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.330 
until your water gets down to a level
that<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.570> keep<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.350> cover<00:01:13.890> intact

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that will still keep your cover intact

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.630 
that will still keep your cover intact
but<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.840> much<00:01:15.990> water<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.920> create

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
but it's not so much water as to create

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
but it's not so much water as to create
a<00:01:17.670> problem<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.750> stress<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.409> pool<00:01:19.680> or

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a problem with stress on your pool or

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.090 
a problem with stress on your pool or
ice<00:01:20.790> buildup<00:01:21.270> later<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.530> I'll<00:01:22.680> turn<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
ice buildup later on so I'll turn this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
ice buildup later on so I'll turn this
one<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> we'll<00:01:25.140> talk<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.590> bit

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
one off and we'll talk a little bit

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
one off and we'll talk a little bit
about<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.189> other<00:01:26.310> options<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
about the other options we have and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
about the other options we have and
cover<00:01:27.630> pumps<00:01:29.750> these<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:31.020> three<00:01:31.710> other

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cover pumps these are three other

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
cover pumps these are three other
varieties<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.420> depends

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
varieties we have and it all depends

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.760 
varieties we have and it all depends
upon<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.500> size<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.430> pool<00:01:36.350> how<00:01:37.350> far<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
upon the size of your pool how far you

are<00:01:37.799> away<00:01:37.920> from<00:01:38.130> electricity<00:01:39.979> how<00:01:40.979> high<00:01:41.520> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
are away from electricity how high you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.359 
are away from electricity how high you
have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> pump<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.009> some

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
have to pump the water so you have some

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
have to pump the water so you have some
varieties<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
varieties that that you can use for the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.770
