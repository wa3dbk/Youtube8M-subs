00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.910 
and we'll just kind of put that back
like<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:12.850> shut<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.030> off<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.480> side<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
like that shut that off to the side and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.910 
like that shut that off to the side and
then<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.250> got<00:02:16.460> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
then I got this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.370 
then I got this
Falcon<00:02:18.920> Zord<00:02:19.310> now<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.480> could<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.750> from<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
Falcon Zord now this could be from the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.990 
Falcon Zord now this could be from the
movie<00:02:21.710> or<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.070> could<00:02:22.220> be<00:02:22.340> from<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.670> show

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
movie or it could be from the show

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.300 
movie or it could be from the show
there's<00:02:23.390> actually<00:02:23.840> two<00:02:24.020> different<00:02:24.310> versions

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
there's actually two different versions

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.490 
there's actually two different versions
I<00:02:25.700> think<00:02:25.940> they're<00:02:26.150> basically<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.930> same<00:02:26.960> mold

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
I think they're basically the same mold

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.760 
I think they're basically the same mold
they<00:02:27.740> just<00:02:27.950> had<00:02:28.130> different<00:02:28.610> stickers<00:02:29.770> that's

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
they just had different stickers that's

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.790 
they just had different stickers that's
my<00:02:31.040> guess<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.700> only<00:02:32.480> paid<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.750> dollar<00:02:33.080> for<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
my guess I only paid a dollar for it and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.550 
my guess I only paid a dollar for it and
I've<00:02:33.890> always<00:02:34.070> wanted<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:36.290> kind<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
I've always wanted one so it's kind of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.510 
I've always wanted one so it's kind of
cool<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.770> find<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.280> at<00:02:37.459> Goodwill<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
cool to find it at Goodwill and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.190 
cool to find it at Goodwill and
basically<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:42.050> forms<00:02:43.690> what<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> previously

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
basically it forms what I previously

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.720 
basically it forms what I previously
shown<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.950> frog<00:02:46.220> Zord<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.690> snaps<00:02:48.730> right

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
shown with the frog Zord it snaps right

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.640 
shown with the frog Zord it snaps right
on<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.060> back<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.900> then<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.230> kind<00:02:54.560> of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
on the back of this and then it kind of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.460 
on the back of this and then it kind of
snaps<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.220> back<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.260> let<00:02:57.380> me

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
snaps on the back like that so let me

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.370 
snaps on the back like that so let me
