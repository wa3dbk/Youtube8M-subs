00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 one of the oldest fuels of the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 Humanity is called wood and this one can 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 today in our demanding world 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.460
 with the latest generation of houwald 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.240
 biomass boiler comfortable low 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 and co2 neutral for heat 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 what is meant by co2 neutral in the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.559
 Burning wood will be just as much 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.509
 Carbon dioxide releases the tree in 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.919
 has taken its life cycle and 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.710
 at the natural rotting 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.960
 would release the experience from over 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.060
 70 years is in every hoval 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 pellet boiler its technology 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.530
 guarantees highest efficiency and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 low emissions 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 Moreover, wood is a native 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.950
 renewable and at the same time cheap 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.410
 Fuel means environmentally friendly 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.540
 and cheap at the same time in operation and as 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.490
 heating solution versatile 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.790
 also in the urban environment 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.930
 For example , pellet boilers come in new buildings in 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.360
 one and multi-family kindergartens 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.840
 schools or small commercial objects to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.210
 commitment 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.910
 the hofer solution already applies to the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.480
 Planning the combination with others 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.360
 heat generators with one 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.160
 a pellet heating plus solar system 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.050
 points in addition ecological and 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.490
 economic aspect one 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.350
 pellet heating is also used in the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.970
 Renovation is intelligent 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.040
 Construction details of hoval 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 Pellet boilers facilitate the replacement 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.360
 even in the most difficult conditions 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.750
 find powerful pellet boilers 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.840
 also in complex heat network solutions in 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.480
 the central heating application the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 heating unit produces heat for itself 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.490
 all customers of the local district heating network 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.380
 this is where the technical expertise of hofer is in demand 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 so that the heat is highly efficient 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.940
 is distributed and the overall system 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 safe running 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.070
 what is in it in a heating center too 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 here is a pellet boiler ecological and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 economically an ideal choice 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.680
 if necessary can be used to cover the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.300
 peak load a gas or oil 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.880
 condensing boiler can be combined 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.870
 system solutions with huber pelletskessel 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.720
 convince in a modern urban 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.270
 environment because they are sustainably cheap 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.010
 comfortable and versatile 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.540
 are 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.700
 Heating with wood pellets is a clever one 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.890
 choice in the new building as well as in the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.310
 redevelopment and the complex solutions for 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.310
 heating networks
