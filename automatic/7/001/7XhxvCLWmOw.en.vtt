00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:31.789
 we need to clip me so how 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.789
 can use things buried 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:40.649

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.050

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.760
 take the ball and speech with you was 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:14.010
 That's what will be I chose the company 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.380
 because they have easier hair gel 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.380
 three cups more 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:36.200
 here and feed the pigtail like that was 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.210
 Here is the factory as Usinsk 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.210
 I'll show you what you need to do first 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:06.359
 here are the pieces 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:09.780
 now go huskies and so on ear and 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.780
 make a clip 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.340
 something like this 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.340
 let's say you can do it yourself 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.720
 still the most important thing is to have hair 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.390
 were wet 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.890
 started you fail on the floor what if 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.190
 books a week is worth two hours and not 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.500
 it will be inconvenient to film this all 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.500
 which is better let the hair fly and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.790
 leave two out of two hours to zero 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:22.480
 day to day you can hold 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:22.480
 that they were normal right now I 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:47.400
 so that's something 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.409
 and keep 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.409
 you can put on call 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.969
 release 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:37.870
 your ponyas from candles 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:44.270
 all of these here and there will be 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:46.249
 and the next lesson I'll show you how 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.499
 make such a pinker and 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.499
