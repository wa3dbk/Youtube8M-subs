also output them over HDMI but what

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.650 
also output them over HDMI but what
about<00:00:22.080> third-party<00:00:22.710> apps<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.510> see

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
about third-party apps so you can see

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.040 
about third-party apps so you can see

Angry Birds actually scales nicely to
this<00:00:27.210> display<00:00:29.599> despite<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> fact<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this display despite the fact that it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.540 
this display despite the fact that it
wasn't<00:00:31.170> designed<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:31.800> tablets<00:00:32.130> per<00:00:32.579> se<00:00:33.260> I

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.510 

have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> practice<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:40.520> so

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
have a lot of practice as you can see so

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.709 
have a lot of practice as you can see so
I<00:00:41.550> mean<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:42.450> fairly

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I mean that's actually you know fairly

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.459 
I mean that's actually you know fairly
fairly<00:00:43.079> good<00:00:43.200> experience<00:00:45.110> other<00:00:46.110> apps

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
fairly good experience other apps

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.029 
fairly good experience other apps
actually<00:00:46.920> aren't<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.930> well<00:00:48.930> optimized<00:00:49.530> for

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually aren't that well optimized for

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
actually aren't that well optimized for
tablets<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.910> here's<00:00:51.120> Pandora<00:00:51.750> for

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
tablets you know here's Pandora for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
tablets you know here's Pandora for
example<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> iPad<00:00:52.949> there's<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
example like on the iPad there's a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
example like on the iPad there's a
special<00:00:54.149> tablet<00:00:54.420> interface<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.410> HD

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
special tablet interface and it's an HD

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.720 
special tablet interface and it's an HD
app<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.489> album

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
app here you can see that the the album

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
app here you can see that the the album
art<00:00:59.879> should<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.120> loading<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.899> usually

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
art should be loading but it's usually

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
art should be loading but it's usually
tucked<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> left<00:01:02.370> hand<00:01:02.609> corner

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
tucked up here in the left hand corner

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
tucked up here in the left hand corner
and<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.930> sort<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> low<00:01:04.500> fidelity

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and it's just sort of a low fidelity

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
and it's just sort of a low fidelity
experience<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.030> what's<00:01:06.210> good<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
experience but what's good is is the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
experience but what's good is is the
sound<00:01:08.159> quality<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.360> mentioned

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
sound quality and as we have mentioned

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.410 
sound quality and as we have mentioned
before<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.150> access<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.880> music<00:01:18.000> pretty

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
before you can access the music pretty

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
before you can access the music pretty
quickly<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> system<00:01:19.380> bar<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
quickly for a system bar so it's a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
quickly for a system bar so it's a
pretty<00:01:20.640> nice<00:01:20.850> experience<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
pretty nice experience but it's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
pretty nice experience but it's
definitely<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.619> tablet<00:01:23.280> optimized<00:01:23.759> app

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
definitely not a tablet optimized app

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
definitely not a tablet optimized app

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
controls all in one place you have to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.760 
controls all in one place you have to
move<00:02:28.010> left<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.400> right<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:30.140> these<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.680> know

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770

controls<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.400> different<00:02:31.730> sides<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.270> gets

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
controls on different sides and it gets

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.900 
controls on different sides and it gets
confusing<00:02:32.840> pretty<00:02:33.170> quickly<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.520> visuals

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
confusing pretty quickly but the visuals

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.370 
confusing pretty quickly but the visuals
are<00:02:35.060> good<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.480> obviously<00:02:35.900> there's<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.200> good

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
you'll see that there's a division

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.860

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
apps so like most of these will be phone

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.930 
apps so like most of these will be phone
apps<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.870> hopefully<00:03:12.530> we'd<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.190> see<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
