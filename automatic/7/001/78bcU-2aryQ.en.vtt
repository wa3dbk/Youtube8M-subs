00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.470
 so dear friends i think you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 have noticed that this video series is dedicated to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.320
 assembling the lower two layers of the Rubik's cube 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 I number not numbers and letters well 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 probably to make it simple 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 unusual to somehow highlight her 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.689
 of the rest 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 a series of educational videos and not only 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.310
 teaching all 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 are numbered I to this all videos 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.380
 numbered and now decided 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.989
 put the letters and the last series went under 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.100
 letter e, respectively, it will be under 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.590
 letter Ñ‘ in the last series I told you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 in a situation like this when a guy 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.809
 high self-esteem when a girl 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 lives on the third floor when not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 familiar with each other and they seem to be 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.600
 love but not everything is as smooth as it seems 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.870
 I told you what to do in such 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.610
 situations and promised that I will talk about 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.820
 last case of this series and here it is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.360
 this last case is very similar to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 this 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.960
 only in this case the angle as well 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 exaggerated self-esteem ie the guy 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.400
 the girl also lives on the third floor 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 don't know each other like them 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 love but not everything is as smooth as you want 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.920
 but the girl is not to the left of the guy 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.329
 behind him how to be in such a situation 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.070
 there are two options now tell you 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.030
 about 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.030
 option number one naturally connect 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:01.469
 a guy, that is, under the lead guy to his 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.719
 the center had to do it and if 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.729
 the girl was here but I think in the past 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.270
 video I forgot to say about it but not yet 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.959
 late 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.410
 I remind about it and so we bring to my 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 cent 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.570
 that is, it is important that the center and these two 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.700
 center were the same color as here 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.000
 these two stickers and so what we do next 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.370
 farther 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.720
 we see that the girl is not to the left of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.710
 guy and behind 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 we do this interception here and now 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.950
 We get a situation that is very 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.410
 like the one we are with you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.650
 parsed in the previous video only 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:51.620
 you will need to do everything on the left and not on the right 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.180
 so the girl and the boy are leaving 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.370
 the police and soon they start 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.300
 seek include their galkina 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.470
 include them on the left and not on the right 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:09.330
 the girl with the guy we come back 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.590
 part that is the guy is driving down in 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 left side of the cube 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:20.160
 the girl goes to the roof already goes to another 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:25.650
 side guy makes her step towards 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.380
 but she continues to ride the roof and here 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.690
 thus restoring the cross we 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.560
 we get the perfect pair happy pair 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.459
 which also lives its own 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.370
 apartment is a way out of this situation under 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.500
 number one and now tell you about 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.500
 exit number 2 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.739
 I have already modeled a similar situation 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.140
 I hope you noticed it 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.050
 here he is a guy who is overpriced 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.720
 self-esteem here she is a girl who lives 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.830
 on the third floor and is located behind 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.600
 guy they are well acquainted even love each 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.640
 friend's new relationship is not so smooth 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.620
 docked with centers in this case 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.560
 green red should be centers 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.770
 and here blue is red so we do 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.260
 such a move aa docked the first option 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.740
 had to make such a transition 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.660
 and the second option is to make this 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.640
 interception and then we have to do everything 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.840
 not the front as we did before but behind 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:47.720
 the girl and the boy are leaving again soon and 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:53.130
 the police are still looking for them 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:57.800
 come back but now the guy leaves not 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.890
 this way but this way at 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.990
 girls riding the roof 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:09.030
 the guy makes her step forward 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.630
 she continues to ride the roof and the last 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.570
 restore the cross and get 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.200
 our couple of lovers is just not here 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.590
 not front and back 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.170
 here it is our pair of lovers 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.510
 Well, congratulations to you so that we 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.930
 sorted out with absolutely everyone 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.590
 situations when a guy is overpriced 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:39.180
 self-esteem and the girl lives on the third 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.910
 floor wherever she lived and what 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.110
 the relationship between them was not 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.970
 we don't care with these situations 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:52.310
 We understand we already know how to reconcile them 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:55.590
 and how to settle them in your own apartment 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.180
 the next part of this video is speech 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:03.390
 will talk about how about when 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.950
 guy's high self-esteem a girl 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:10.110
 lives not on the third floor but on the second 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.830
 Well, something like that to new meetings 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.830
 Dear friends
