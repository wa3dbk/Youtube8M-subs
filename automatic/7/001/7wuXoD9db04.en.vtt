actually<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.700> high-end<00:00:15.059> trekking<00:00:15.599> level<00:00:15.839> and

actually the high-end trekking level and
it<00:00:16.259> just<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.500> happens<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> UK<00:00:17.430> there's

it's an 11 speed rapid fire plus shifter

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.170 
it's an 11 speed rapid fire plus shifter
it<00:00:52.920> works<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.400> way<00:00:53.580> as<00:00:53.640> mountain<00:00:54.059> bike

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it works the same way as mountain bike

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.210 
it works the same way as mountain bike
shifters<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.710> opposite<00:00:56.040> way

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220

main difference between this and the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
main difference between this and the
current<00:01:03.000> I'll<00:01:03.210> find<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:04.199> gear<00:01:04.379> spreads<00:01:04.710> much

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
current I'll find the gear spreads much

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.570 
current I'll find the gear spreads much
much<00:01:05.280> longer<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.650> 409<00:01:07.650> percent<00:01:08.070> versus

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
much longer so it's 409 percent versus

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.169 
much longer so it's 409 percent versus
306<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.070> speed<00:01:11.429> of<00:01:11.609> the<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> gear
