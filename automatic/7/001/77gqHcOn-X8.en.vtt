I've<00:00:07.009> always<00:00:07.399> struggled<00:00:07.580> with<00:00:07.850> algae<00:00:08.600> growing

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
I've always struggled with algae growing

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.220 
I've always struggled with algae growing
on<00:00:09.590> my<00:00:09.679> glass<00:00:09.969> now<00:00:10.969> as<00:00:11.030> far<00:00:11.210> as<00:00:11.269> I<00:00:11.450> know<00:00:11.509> there's

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
on my glass now as far as I know there's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.499 
on my glass now as far as I know there's
no<00:00:12.469> good<00:00:13.160> way<00:00:13.400> to<00:00:13.429> prevent<00:00:13.940> that<00:00:14.120> algae<00:00:14.419> from

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
no good way to prevent that algae from

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.690 
no good way to prevent that algae from
growing<00:00:14.629> on<00:00:14.900> Mike<00:00:15.019> on<00:00:15.290> your<00:00:15.440> glass<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.520> you're

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
growing on Mike on your glass so you're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.180 
growing on Mike on your glass so you're
gonna<00:00:16.790> have<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.000> remove<00:00:17.270> it<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.170> up<00:00:18.440> until<00:00:18.860> this

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
gonna have to remove it so up until this

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.570 
gonna have to remove it so up until this
point<00:00:19.520> I've<00:00:20.210> always<00:00:20.600> used<00:00:20.930> one<00:00:21.590> of<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.770> mag

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
point I've always used one of the mag

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.210 
point I've always used one of the mag
float<00:00:23.260> magnets<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:24.740> these<00:00:24.890> things<00:00:25.100> are

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
float magnets and these things are

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.510 
float magnets and these things are
really<00:00:25.700> good<00:00:26.120> in<00:00:26.600> that<00:00:27.170> they're<00:00:27.980> pretty

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
really good in that they're pretty

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.190 
really good in that they're pretty
strong<00:00:28.880> they're<00:00:29.240> gonna<00:00:29.360> hold<00:00:29.780> on<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.050> your

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
strong they're gonna hold on to your

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.619 
strong they're gonna hold on to your
glass<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.860> if<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.070> try<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:31.970> clean<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.300> algae

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
glass and if you try to clean the algae

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.479 
glass and if you try to clean the algae
off<00:00:32.660> if<00:00:33.109> you<00:00:33.440> knock<00:00:33.649> it<00:00:33.679> off<00:00:33.949> close<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.399> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
off if you knock it off close to the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.029 
off if you knock it off close to the
surface<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:35.149> easy<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.809> retrieve<00:00:36.170> that's

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
surface so it's easy to retrieve that's

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.569 
surface so it's easy to retrieve that's
really<00:00:37.429> cool<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:38.980> things<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.190> didn't<00:00:40.550> like

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
really cool the things I didn't like

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.470 
really cool the things I didn't like
about<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.059> mag<00:00:41.239> float<00:00:41.539> was<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:44.059> didn't

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
about the mag float was that it didn't

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.779 
about the mag float was that it didn't
get<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.749> really<00:00:44.989> hard<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.010> green<00:00:46.249> algae<00:00:46.460> off

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
get the really hard and green algae off

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.169 
get the really hard and green algae off
of<00:00:46.969> there<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:48.829> know<00:00:49.699> what<00:00:49.909> he<00:00:50.089> was

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
of there and you know what he was

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.149 
of there and you know what he was
starting<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.510> scratch<00:00:50.719> my<00:00:50.960> glass<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.530> that

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
starting to scratch my glass and that

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.250 
starting to scratch my glass and that
was<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.760> deal<00:00:52.909> killer<00:00:53.179> with<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:53.569> thing<00:00:53.780> what

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
was the deal killer with this thing what

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.309 
was the deal killer with this thing what
happens<00:00:54.679> is<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:55.219> you<00:00:55.339> look<00:00:55.370> at<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.019> velcro<00:00:57.019> on

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
happens is if you look at the velcro on

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.639 
happens is if you look at the velcro on
the<00:00:57.589> inside<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:58.850> get<00:00:59.089> rock<00:00:59.899> stuck<00:01:00.289> in<00:01:00.469> there

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
the inside you get rock stuck in there

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.229 
the inside you get rock stuck in there
and<00:01:00.920> those<00:01:01.519> rocks

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
and those rocks

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.800 
and those rocks
scratch<00:01:02.719> your<00:01:02.989> glass<00:01:03.519> it's<00:01:04.519> bad<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.210> glass<00:01:05.510> I

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
scratch your glass it's bad on glass I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.780 
scratch your glass it's bad on glass I
couldn't<00:01:06.230> imagine<00:01:06.620> what's<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> Crillon

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
couldn't imagine what's like a Crillon

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.990 
couldn't imagine what's like a Crillon
tank<00:01:08.120> so<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.350> looked<00:01:09.620> long<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.160> hard<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.790> I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
tank so I looked long and hard and I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.360 
tank so I looked long and hard and I
think<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.270> found<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.540> solution<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.620> check<00:01:13.220> it

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
think I found the solution so check it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.570 
think I found the solution so check it
out<00:01:13.510> this<00:01:14.510> is<00:01:14.540> one<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.020> best<00:01:15.800> products<00:01:16.370> for

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
out this is one of the best products for

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.220 
out this is one of the best products for
the<00:01:16.700> aquarium<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:17.570> have<00:01:17.720> bought<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.140> a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
the aquarium that I have bought in a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.660 
the aquarium that I have bought in a
long<00:01:18.650> time<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.880> last<00:01:20.330> one<00:01:20.780> was<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.670> Gebo

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
long time the last one was the Gebo

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.880 
long time the last one was the Gebo
pumps<00:01:23.120> they<00:01:23.300> were<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:23.840> very<00:01:24.200> inexpensive

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
pumps they were just very inexpensive

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.760 
pumps they were just very inexpensive
they<00:01:25.040> worked<00:01:25.280> incredibly<00:01:26.180> well<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
they worked incredibly well and the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.230 
they worked incredibly well and the
reliability<00:01:28.310> don't<00:01:28.700> those<00:01:28.850> things<00:01:28.880> has<00:01:29.120> been

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
reliability don't those things has been

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.480 
reliability don't those things has been
unbelievable<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.070> thing's<00:01:31.310> turning

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
unbelievable and this thing's turning

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.850 
unbelievable and this thing's turning
out<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.790> be<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:32.780> as<00:01:32.900> surprisingly<00:01:33.470> good<00:01:33.710> this

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
out to be just as surprisingly good this

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.330 
out to be just as surprisingly good this
is<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.090> tons<00:01:35.090> II<00:01:35.270> care<00:01:35.600> magnet<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.950> long

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is the tons II care magnet it's the long

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.300 
is the tons II care magnet it's the long
magnet<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.530> what's<00:01:39.530> different<00:01:39.920> about<00:01:39.950> this

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
magnet and what's different about this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.030 
magnet and what's different about this
from<00:01:40.970> most<00:01:41.360> magnets<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.400> doesn't<00:01:44.300> use

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
from most magnets is that it doesn't use

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.840 
from most magnets is that it doesn't use
the<00:01:46.040> traditional<00:01:48.130> velcro<00:01:49.130> II<00:01:49.160> stuff<00:01:49.580> on<00:01:49.730> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the traditional velcro II stuff on the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.350 
the traditional velcro II stuff on the
bottom<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.330> here<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.930> uses<00:01:51.470> blades<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:53.090> scrape

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
bottom in here it uses blades to scrape

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.170 
bottom in here it uses blades to scrape
the<00:01:54.200> algae<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.400> what<00:01:55.550> that<00:01:55.640> means<00:01:55.880> is

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the algae on so what that means is

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.920 
the algae on so what that means is
you're<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.470> picking<00:01:58.100> up<00:01:58.460> rock<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.690> debris

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
you're not picking up rock and debris

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.850 
you're not picking up rock and debris
off<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:01.220> sand<00:02:01.640> bed<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.410> you're<00:02:03.410> not<00:02:03.530> spore

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
off of the sand bed and you're not spore

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.810 
off of the sand bed and you're not spore
outing<00:02:04.160> your<00:02:04.250> glass

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
outing your glass

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.190 
outing your glass
now<00:02:04.970> this<00:02:05.150> 210<00:02:05.990> tank<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.770> purchased<00:02:07.400> brand-new

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
now this 210 tank I purchased brand-new

think<00:04:14.359> it's<00:04:15.230> gonna<00:04:15.500> suck<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.850> was<00:04:17.000> really

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
think it's gonna suck and I was really

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.180 
think it's gonna suck and I was really
Larry<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.109> buy<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.320> magnet<00:04:18.890> because<00:04:19.039> it's

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
Larry to buy this magnet because it's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.370 
Larry to buy this magnet because it's
rated<00:04:20.000> only<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.479> happen<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:20.930> thick<00:04:21.140> glass

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
rated only to happen it's thick glass

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.440 
rated only to happen it's thick glass
and<00:04:21.799> that's<00:04:22.520> what<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.789> had<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.210> can<00:04:23.300> kind<00:04:23.419> of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
and that's what I had you can kind of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.020 
and that's what I had you can kind of
see<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.720> edge<00:04:23.840> here<00:04:24.460> happens<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.729> glass<00:04:26.000> and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
see the edge here happens that glass and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.490 
see the edge here happens that glass and
usually

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
usually

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800 
usually
these<00:04:27.890> magnets<00:04:28.370> aren't<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.730> strong<00:04:29.090> this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
these magnets aren't that strong this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.350 
these magnets aren't that strong this
thing<00:04:30.080> is<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.290> beast<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:31.220> mean<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.940> can<00:04:32.060> move<00:04:32.210> it

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
thing is a beast I mean you can move it

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.540 
thing is a beast I mean you can move it
really<00:04:33.080> fast<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.740> it's<00:04:33.860> not<00:04:34.010> falling<00:04:34.430> off

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
really fast and it's not falling off

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.960 
really fast and it's not falling off
that's<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.540> lot<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.990> hard<00:04:36.230> knocks<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:37.700> can<00:04:37.820> see

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
that's a lot of hard knocks you can see

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.610 
that's a lot of hard knocks you can see
that's<00:04:38.090> what<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.390> took<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.600> knock<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.990> off<00:04:39.110> it

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
that's what it took to knock it off it

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.560 
that's what it took to knock it off it
works<00:04:39.890> really<00:04:40.250> well<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.850> only<00:04:41.690> downside<00:04:42.200> is

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
works really well the only downside is

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.120 
works really well the only downside is
you're<00:04:44.570> not<00:04:44.900> able<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.500> go<00:04:45.620> around<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:45.890> corner

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
you're not able to go around a corner

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.850 
you're not able to go around a corner
with<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.060> make<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> corners<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.990> do<00:04:48.380> have

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
with it so to make the corners I do have

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.900 
with it so to make the corners I do have
to<00:04:49.130> lift<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.940> magnet<00:04:50.300> up<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:51.500> physically<00:04:52.400> go

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
to lift the magnet up and physically go

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.250 
to lift the magnet up and physically go
around<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.270> court<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.690> does<00:04:53.870> come<00:04:54.110> with<00:04:54.140> some

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
around the court it does come with some

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.650 
around the court it does come with some
smaller<00:04:54.770> blades<00:04:55.190> which<00:04:56.000> allow<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.420> put

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
smaller blades which allow you to put

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.880 
smaller blades which allow you to put
more<00:04:56.960> pressure<00:04:57.230> on<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:59.540> algae<00:04:59.990> itself<00:05:00.500> which

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
more pressure on the algae itself which

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.680 
more pressure on the algae itself which
is<00:05:01.070> good<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.760> also<00:05:01.820> comes<00:05:02.150> with<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.360> metal

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
is good and it also comes with a metal

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.409 
is good and it also comes with a metal
blade<00:05:03.050> which<00:05:03.290> allows<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.950> really<00:05:04.790> get<00:05:05.120> in

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
blade which allows you to really get in

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.500 
blade which allows you to really get in
on<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.780> coral<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.500> algae<00:05:06.620> so<00:05:07.610> for<00:05:08.180> me<00:05:08.270> this

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
on that coral and algae so for me this

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.460 
on that coral and algae so for me this
thing<00:05:08.720> has<00:05:08.870> been<00:05:09.460> amazing<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.930> love<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.110> tons

Ton Zi long is the one I would buy I was

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.990 
Ton Zi long is the one I would buy I was
really<00:05:32.870> leaning<00:05:33.229> towards<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.830> strong<00:05:34.250> but

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
really leaning towards the strong but

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.790 
really leaning towards the strong but
bulk<00:05:35.270> resupply<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.840> was<00:05:36.050> out<00:05:36.169> of<00:05:36.290> stock<00:05:36.470> the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
bulk resupply it was out of stock the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.520 
bulk resupply it was out of stock the
strong<00:05:37.040> is<00:05:37.190> about<00:05:37.400> double<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:37.940> money<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.530> you

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
strong is about double the money and you

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.860 
strong is about double the money and you
know<00:05:39.650> what<00:05:39.890> it's<00:05:40.280> not<00:05:40.520> necessary<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:41.570> thing

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
know what it's not necessary this thing

as<00:05:42.050> is<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.520> beast<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:45.400> just<00:05:46.400> thought<00:05:46.520> I'd

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
as is is a beast so just thought I'd

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.909 
as is is a beast so just thought I'd
show<00:05:46.940> off<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.300> new<00:05:47.330> magnet<00:05:47.900> I'm<00:05:48.500> thinking

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
show off the new magnet I'm thinking

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.700 
show off the new magnet I'm thinking
this<00:05:49.040> is<00:05:49.450> really<00:05:50.450> what<00:05:50.720> most<00:05:50.930> of<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:51.260> hobby<00:05:51.500> is
