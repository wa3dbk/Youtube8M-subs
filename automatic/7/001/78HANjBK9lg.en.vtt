laser FX is actually one of three

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.209 
laser FX is actually one of three
different<00:00:12.480> lasers<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.049> Joe<00:00:13.469> Bay<00:00:13.620> has<00:00:13.950> in

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
different lasers that Joe Bay has in

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.609 
different lasers that Joe Bay has in
this<00:00:14.340> series<00:00:14.639> size<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> palm<00:00:16.109> your<00:00:16.320> hand

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
this series size of the palm your hand

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.179 
this series size of the palm your hand
we<00:00:16.949> talk<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.279> small<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.210> powerful<00:00:19.189> 150

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
we talk about small it's powerful 150

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910 
we talk about small it's powerful 150
milliwatts<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.109> when<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> say<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.560> one<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
milliwatts and when I say it's one of

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.590 
milliwatts and when I say it's one of
three<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> series<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> three<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.420> also

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
three of a series of three they also

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.769 
three of a series of three they also
have<00:00:24.840> two<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.910> got<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.330> min

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
have two more like this you got the min

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.070 
have two more like this you got the min
laser<00:00:28.019> rgx<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.609> lots<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.029> red<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
laser rgx which is just lots of red and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
laser rgx which is just lots of red and
green<00:00:31.260> dots<00:00:31.529> shooting<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.130> over<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.460> place

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
green dots shooting all over the place

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.959 
green dots shooting all over the place
then<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.260> men<00:00:34.440> lazer<00:00:34.680> star<00:00:35.219> which

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
then you have the men lazer star which

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.110 
then you have the men lazer star which
has<00:00:36.210> sort<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.719> star<00:00:37.020> effect<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.850> mid

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
has sort of a star effect then the mid

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.100 
has sort of a star effect then the mid
laser<00:00:39.360> FX<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:41.000> sort<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.239> both<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> those

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
laser FX has sort of like both of those

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.619 
laser FX has sort of like both of those
patterns<00:00:43.500> plus<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.450> your

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
patterns plus a lot more it's got your

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
patterns plus a lot more it's got your
star<00:00:45.930> movement<00:00:46.260> its<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> pattern<00:00:47.730> all

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
star movement its got like a pattern all

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
star movement its got like a pattern all
kinds<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.780> stuff<00:00:48.989> tell<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.500> let's<00:00:49.980> go

without fog and give you an example some
of<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.110> lasers<00:02:12.379> that<00:02:12.410> don't<00:02:12.799> look<00:02:12.950> good<00:02:13.010> with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
of the lasers that don't look good with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.729 
of the lasers that don't look good with
fog<00:02:13.610> would<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.780> Cirrus<00:02:15.200> laser<00:02:15.440> by

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
fog would be like the Cirrus laser by

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.059 
fog would be like the Cirrus laser by
chauvet<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:17.480> does<00:02:17.959> not<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.349> fun<00:02:18.590> because<00:02:18.950> it

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
chauvet it does not like fun because it

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.729 
chauvet it does not like fun because it
has<00:02:19.190> like<00:02:19.489> such<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> wide<00:02:20.390> awesome<00:02:21.140> pattern<00:02:21.500> if

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
has like such a wide awesome pattern if

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.050 
has like such a wide awesome pattern if
you<00:02:21.829> get<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:21.980> chance<00:02:22.220> check<00:02:22.430> out<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> video<00:02:23.000> on

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you get a chance check out the video on

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.390 
you get a chance check out the video on
that<00:02:23.299> that's<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.630> serious<00:02:23.959> laser<00:02:24.160> lasers<00:02:25.160> are

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
that that's the serious laser lasers are

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520 
that that's the serious laser lasers are
really<00:02:25.910> becoming<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.420> hot<00:02:26.630> thing<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.260> for

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
really becoming a hot thing that's for

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.130 
really becoming a hot thing that's for
sure<00:02:27.799> here<00:02:28.610> take<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.880> look<00:02:28.940> at<00:02:29.120> these<00:02:29.239> lot<00:02:30.049> of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
sure here take a look at these lot of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.960 
sure here take a look at these lot of
these<00:02:30.230> are<00:02:30.380> more<00:02:30.530> expensive<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.760> one

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
these are more expensive to this one

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.170 
these are more expensive to this one
remember<00:02:32.329> is<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.480> one<00:02:32.959> 1999<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:34.970> here

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
remember is just one 1999 this one here

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.880
