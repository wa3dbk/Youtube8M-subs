00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
wrong so this is how to do it there we

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
wrong so this is how to do it there we
go<00:00:32.759> that's<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.140> where<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
go that's what it is and it's where the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
go that's what it is and it's where the
bullet<00:00:34.710> comes<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.420> cool<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
bullet comes in and it's all cool and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
bullet comes in and it's all cool and
then<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> goes<00:00:38.100> shooting<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.960> will

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
then it goes shooting in and you will

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
then it goes shooting in and you will
need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> download<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.129> video<00:00:41.550> clip<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> that's

it's an open area but if you do want to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's an open area but if you do want to
record<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> cinematic<00:01:20.939> yourself<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
record the cinematic yourself all it is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
record the cinematic yourself all it is
is<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.409> find<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> pivot<00:01:23.280> point<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
is you find like a pivot point and you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.929 
is you find like a pivot point and you
do<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> 360<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
do a 360 there so if I put this down to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
do a 360 there so if I put this down to
half<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.420> hit<00:01:27.570> play<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.310> that's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
half and hit play you see it's that's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.130 
half and hit play you see it's that's
going<00:01:30.090> slow<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.960> just

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
going slow there we go how it's just

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.100 
going slow there we go how it's just
kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.960> do

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
kind of like I you just I don't know do

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
kind of like I you just I don't know do
like<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> 360<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.369> where<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> bullet

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
like a 360 on like where the bullet

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
like a 360 on like where the bullet
would<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.920> then<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.520> follow<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
would be and then you just follow it and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.399 
would be and then you just follow it and
this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:39.509> skilled<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.780 
get rid of that and all these and that
and<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.229> okay<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.920> our<00:01:56.159> our

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and that okay so here we got our our

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.859 
and that okay so here we got our our
clip<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> use<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.509> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
clip that we want to use and it is just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.819 
clip that we want to use and it is just
simply<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.619> shot<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.729> highrise<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
simply a shot on highrise so all it is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
simply a shot on highrise so all it is
is<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.219> does<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> spin<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.780> cut<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
is he does the spin and then we cut the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
is he does the spin and then we cut the
frame<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:08.039> where<00:02:08.190> he<00:02:08.340> shoots<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.239> rate

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
frame out right where he shoots so rate

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.270 
frame out right where he shoots so rate
then

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
then

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.300 
then
he<00:02:10.610> shoots<00:02:10.880> actually<00:02:11.270> go<00:02:11.450> back<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.630> little<00:02:11.840> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
he shoots actually go back a little bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.440 
he shoots actually go back a little bit
he<00:02:13.310> shoots<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.910> then<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.330> go

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
he shoots and then it's going to go

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.180 
he shoots and then it's going to go
bullet<00:02:15.020> bullet<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.500> haven't<00:02:15.770> made<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.920> yet<00:02:16.010> but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
bullet bullet we haven't made it yet but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.340 
bullet bullet we haven't made it yet but
it's<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.610> bullet<00:02:17.030> bullet<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.630> then

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
it's going to be bullet bullet and then

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.620 
it's going to be bullet bullet and then
right<00:02:19.130> after<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.490> i've<00:02:19.819> added<00:02:20.000> twitch<00:02:20.390> on

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
right after that i've added twitch on

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.050 
right after that i've added twitch on
there<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.069> goes<00:02:22.370> twixtor<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
there and then it just goes twixtor and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.550 
there and then it just goes twixtor and
it<00:02:23.120> goes<00:02:23.300> down<00:02:23.510> like<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it goes down like that but that's the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.110 
it goes down like that but that's the
main<00:02:24.740> part<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.459> pretty<00:02:25.580> easy<00:02:25.850> so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
main part of it it's pretty easy so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.330 
main part of it it's pretty easy so
let's<00:02:26.270> jump<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.770> any<00:02:27.950> competition

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
let's jump in so we have any competition

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
let's jump in so we have any competition
here<00:02:28.940> first<00:02:29.300> thing<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.569> want<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.780> do<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.020> bring

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.320 
here first thing we want to do is bring
our<00:02:30.290> cinematics<00:02:30.860> down<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.400> here's<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> ones<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
our cinematics down so here's the ones I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.050 
our cinematics down so here's the ones I
used<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.650> there

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
used right here but I'm on get on there

all right beautiful so we're going to go

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.449 
all right beautiful so we're going to go
to<00:02:40.819> where<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.180> cut<00:02:41.600> them<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.380> right<00:02:43.040> here's

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
to where I cut them so right here's

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.729 
to where I cut them so right here's
where<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.640> started<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.300> turn<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.050> all<00:02:45.320> end

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
where I started to turn so all end

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.979 
where I started to turn so all end
bracket<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.430> there<00:02:47.330> we<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.600> there's<00:02:47.810> our

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
bracket and there we go so there's our

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.960 
bracket and there we go so there's our
cinematic<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.980> shot<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.820> goes

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
cinematic for the shot and it just goes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.729 
cinematic for the shot and it just goes
in<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> circle<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.470> pretty

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
in a circle like that and it's pretty

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.870 
in a circle like that and it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.860> where<00:02:54.860> does<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.069> end<00:02:55.400> it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
straightforward and where does it end it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.820 
straightforward and where does it end it
ends<00:02:56.030> right<00:02:56.150> about<00:02:56.420> there<00:02:56.630> okay<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.019> what<00:02:57.739> we

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
ends right about there okay so what we

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.620 
ends right about there okay so what we
want<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> do<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.370> go<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.580> like<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.819> middle<00:02:59.480> of

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
want to do is go to like the middle of

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.090 
want to do is go to like the middle of
our<00:02:59.720> cinematic<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.530> place<00:03:00.739> our<00:03:00.920> cursor

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
our cinematic and just place our cursor

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.290 
our cinematic and just place our cursor
there<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.540> right<00:03:02.810> around<00:03:03.459> about<00:03:04.459> here

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
there for now so right around about here

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.759 
there for now so right around about here
because<00:03:05.840> that's<00:03:06.019> where<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> bullet<00:03:06.530> would<00:03:06.620> be

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
because that's where the bullet would be

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.280 
because that's where the bullet would be
flying<00:03:07.239> we're<00:03:08.239> going<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.420> s<00:03:08.750> on<00:03:09.019> our<00:03:09.110> keyboard

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
flying we're going to s on our keyboard

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
flying we're going to s on our keyboard
and<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.920> scale<00:03:10.220> up<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.370> cinematics<00:03:11.060> because

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
and just scale up the cinematics because

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.990 
and just scale up the cinematics because
I<00:03:12.069> we<00:03:13.069> don't<00:03:13.220> need<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.519> see<00:03:13.640> anything<00:03:13.880> on<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
I we don't need to see anything on the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.150 
I we don't need to see anything on the
top<00:03:14.269> go<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.170> maybe<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.440> little<00:03:15.620> bit<00:03:15.860> okay<00:03:16.100> so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
top go for maybe a little bit okay so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.890 
top go for maybe a little bit okay so
there<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.430> go<00:03:16.549> there's<00:03:17.090> our<00:03:17.209> cinematic<00:03:17.720> that's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
there we go there's our cinematic that's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.350 
there we go there's our cinematic that's
where<00:03:18.079> we<00:03:18.200> want<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.500> bullet<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.950> be<00:03:19.209> when<00:03:20.209> it's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
where we want the bullet to be when it's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.810 
where we want the bullet to be when it's
perfectly<00:03:20.989> straight<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:22.519> we're<00:03:22.640> going<00:03:22.760> to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
perfectly straight so now we're going to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.340 
perfectly straight so now we're going to
get<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.420> bullet<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.019> said<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.979 
a green screen and it's just a bullet
comes<00:03:34.340> flying<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.239> slides<00:03:35.510> out<00:03:35.690> so

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
comes flying in and slides out so

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.390 
comes flying in and slides out so
there's<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.560> lot<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.769> ways<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:36.980> get<00:03:37.160> where<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
there's a lot of ways to get where the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.460 
there's a lot of ways to get where the
green<00:03:37.579> screen<00:03:37.850> my<00:03:38.150> opinion<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.660> best<00:03:38.840> way<00:03:39.170> is

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
green screen my opinion the best way is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.199 
green screen my opinion the best way is
to<00:03:39.500> look<00:03:39.709> up<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.190> an<00:03:40.250> effect<00:03:40.579> called<00:03:40.670> key

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
to look up for an effect called key

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.500 
to look up for an effect called key
light<00:03:41.480> chelating<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.709> some<00:03:42.980> 1.2<00:03:43.400> put<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.420> on

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.479 
light chelating on some 1.2 put that on
your<00:03:44.690> bullet<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.230> then<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.709> uh<00:03:45.950> where<00:03:46.400> it

also you'll see here we got this like

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.789 
also you'll see here we got this like
white<00:03:55.820> outer<00:03:56.329> line<00:03:56.720> its<00:03:57.049> kind<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.290> delicates

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
white outer line its kind of delicates

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.039 
white outer line its kind of delicates
on<00:03:57.920> half<00:03:58.130> quality<00:03:58.730> there<00:03:59.299> we<00:03:59.420> go<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.870> see

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
on half quality there we go we can see

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.900 
on half quality there we go we can see
it<00:04:00.140> looks<00:04:00.380> ugly<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.190> rid<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.670> we

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
it looks ugly so to get rid of that we

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.599 
it looks ugly so to get rid of that we
go<00:04:02.060> over<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.299> screen<00:04:02.840> mat<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.829> recess<00:04:04.160> clip<00:04:04.459> on

go over to screen mat in recess clip on
black<00:04:04.970> just<00:04:05.329> bring<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.660> up<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.900> little<00:04:06.049> bit<00:04:06.170> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
black just bring it up a little bit to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.460 
black just bring it up a little bit to
like<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.859> don't<00:04:06.920> know<00:04:07.010> 50<00:04:07.489> maybe<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:08.410> don't<00:04:09.410> know

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
like I don't know 50 maybe I don't know

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.900 
like I don't know 50 maybe I don't know
see<00:04:09.680> what<00:04:09.829> if<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.040> gets<00:04:10.070> too<00:04:10.310> high<00:04:10.489> close<00:04:10.760> a

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
see what if it gets too high close a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.220 
see what if it gets too high close a
transparent<00:04:11.510> we<00:04:11.570> don't<00:04:11.720> want<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:11.930> we've

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
transparent we don't want that we've

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.099 
transparent we don't want that we've
just<00:04:12.470> wanted<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:12.829> like<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:14.090> very<00:04:14.660> off<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.079> I

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
just wanted it like like very off so I

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.349 
just wanted it like like very off so I
got<00:04:15.320> 25<00:04:15.859> hold<00:04:16.100> work<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.310> guess<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.209> they're

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
got 25 hold work I guess and they're

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.080 
got 25 hold work I guess and they're
going<00:04:17.539> on<00:04:17.810> with<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.019> white<00:04:18.260> line<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.890> it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
going on with that white line and it

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.090 
going on with that white line and it
looks<00:04:19.180> good<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:20.230> that's<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.709> basic<00:04:21.540> makeup

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
looks good so that's the basic makeup

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.920 
looks good so that's the basic makeup
yeah<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.130> guess<00:04:24.400> green<00:04:24.639> screen<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.840> now

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
yeah I guess green screen of it so now

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.200 
yeah I guess green screen of it so now
we're<00:04:26.080> going<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.260> slide<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:27.160> over<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.940> where

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
we're going to slide this over to where

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.730 
we're going to slide this over to where
it's<00:04:28.419> in<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.630> middle<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.169> there<00:04:29.350> we<00:04:29.470> go<00:04:29.500> it's

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
it's in the middle so there we go it's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.159 
it's in the middle so there we go it's
in<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.949> middle<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.550> our<00:04:30.699> thing<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:31.990> go<00:04:32.139> to

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
in the middle of our thing now we go to

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.350 
in the middle of our thing now we go to
this<00:04:32.380> end<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.949> cinematic<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.760> we<00:04:34.150> just

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
this end of the cinematic and we just

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.969 
this end of the cinematic and we just
get<00:04:34.660> rid<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> beginning<00:04:35.260> part<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.860> there

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
get rid of the beginning part and there

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.360 
get rid of the beginning part and there
it<00:04:36.100> goes<00:04:36.340> um<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.870> then<00:04:38.020> over<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.740> side<00:04:39.070> in

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
it goes um and then over this side in

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.050 
it goes um and then over this side in
the<00:04:39.639> same<00:04:39.850> thing<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:41.770> can<00:04:41.800> fiddle<00:04:42.760> with<00:04:42.910> it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
the same thing so you can fiddle with it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.969 
the same thing so you can fiddle with it
a<00:04:43.240> little<00:04:43.419> bit<00:04:43.660> like<00:04:43.930> make<00:04:44.350> your<00:04:44.500> cinematics

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
a little bit like make your cinematics

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.800 
a little bit like make your cinematics
longer<00:04:45.310> because<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.729> an<00:04:45.910> awful<00:04:46.300> long<00:04:46.449> green

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
longer because it is an awful long green

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.180 
longer because it is an awful long green
screen<00:04:47.199> like<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.410> can<00:04:47.560> see<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.830> goes<00:04:47.979> all<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
screen like you can see it goes all the

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.570 
screen like you can see it goes all the
way<00:04:48.400> on<00:04:48.550> fast<00:04:49.419> here<00:04:49.750> but<00:04:50.710> we<00:04:51.250> don't<00:04:51.400> have<00:04:51.460> time

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
way on fast here but we don't have time

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.700 
way on fast here but we don't have time
for<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.030> right<00:04:52.360> now<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.690> didn't<00:04:53.110> work<00:04:53.260> record

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
for that right now I didn't work record

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.740 
for that right now I didn't work record
long<00:04:53.889> enough<00:04:54.070> cinematic<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:55.240> now<00:04:55.389> the<00:04:55.450> big

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
long enough cinematic so now the big

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.870 
long enough cinematic so now the big
secret<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.229> makes<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.979> look<00:04:57.220> good<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.610> kind

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
secret that makes it look good it's kind

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.690 
secret that makes it look good it's kind
of<00:04:57.940> key<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.720> scale<00:04:59.139> your<00:04:59.200> cinematic<00:04:59.919> up<00:05:00.280> as

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
of key is to scale your cinematic up as

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.110 
of key is to scale your cinematic up as
it's<00:05:01.300> like<00:05:01.860> like<00:05:02.860> yours<00:05:03.160> like<00:05:03.490> it's<00:05:03.700> zooming

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
it's like like yours like it's zooming

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.719 
it's like like yours like it's zooming
in<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:04.600> we<00:05:05.139> got<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.470> pretty<00:05:06.250> much<00:05:06.460> rate

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
in so we got it pretty much rate

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.330 
in so we got it pretty much rate
centered<00:05:07.389> now<00:05:07.600> so<00:05:08.410> I'm<00:05:08.650> right<00:05:09.100> where<00:05:09.250> the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
centered now so I'm right where the

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.680 
centered now so I'm right where the
bullet<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.700> head<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.180> we're<00:05:10.539> going<00:05:10.630> to

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
bullet is head on we're going to

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.750 
bullet is head on we're going to
keyframe<00:05:11.139> our<00:05:11.410> scale<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.100> bring<00:05:12.310> it<00:05:12.430> way<00:05:12.729> up

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
keyframe our scale and bring it way up

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.930 
keyframe our scale and bring it way up
there<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.450> lay<00:05:14.039> three<00:05:15.039> hundred<00:05:15.310> percent<00:05:15.700> or

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
there to lay three hundred percent or

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.219 
there to lay three hundred percent or
like<00:05:16.090> two<00:05:16.270> hundred<00:05:16.419> and<00:05:16.690> seventy-five

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
like two hundred and seventy-five

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.890 
like two hundred and seventy-five
percent<00:05:17.530> will<00:05:17.860> go<00:05:17.979> with<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.430> then<00:05:19.330> we're

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
percent will go with and then we're

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.330 
percent will go with and then we're
going<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.050> go<00:05:20.199> back<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.590> beginning<00:05:20.830> and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
going to go back to the beginning and

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.370 
going to go back to the beginning and
we're<00:05:21.789> just<00:05:21.910> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.090> bring<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.360> down<00:05:22.419> a<00:05:23.020> lot

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
we're just going to bring it down a lot

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.400 
we're just going to bring it down a lot
so<00:05:23.650> down<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:24.130> Lake<00:05:26.160> 130<00:05:27.270> see<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:28.389> scales<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:29.110> and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
so down to Lake 130 see it scales in and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.490 
so down to Lake 130 see it scales in and
then<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.760> scales<00:05:31.300> out<00:05:31.570> at<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:32.080> end<00:05:32.110> which<00:05:32.410> we

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
then it scales out at the end which we

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.960 
then it scales out at the end which we
have<00:05:32.620> to<00:05:32.710> keyframe<00:05:32.979> again<00:05:33.310> too<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:33.700> then<00:05:33.850> just

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
have to keyframe again too so then just

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.270 
have to keyframe again too so then just
go<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.330> end<00:05:34.479> and<00:05:34.570> key<00:05:34.780> frame<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.169> down<00:05:35.380> to

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
go to the end and key frame it down to

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.580 
go to the end and key frame it down to
like<00:05:36.400> there<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.330> way<00:05:37.539> it<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:37.900> makes<00:05:38.380> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
like there and that way it just makes it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.909 
like there and that way it just makes it
it<00:05:38.830> doesn't<00:05:39.430> have<00:05:40.000> as<00:05:40.210> much<00:05:40.360> avada<00:05:40.800> like<00:05:41.800> a

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
it doesn't have as much avada like a

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.800 
it doesn't have as much avada like a
weird<00:05:42.190> effect<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.729> kind<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:42.970> emphasizes<00:05:43.660> the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
weird effect it kind of emphasizes the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.589 
weird effect it kind of emphasizes the
bullet<00:05:44.260> more<00:05:44.560> so<00:05:45.340> that's<00:05:46.000> it<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:46.150> got<00:05:46.479> our

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
bullet more so that's it we got our

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.290 
bullet more so that's it we got our
composition<00:05:47.260> they're<00:05:47.440> right<00:05:47.770> here<00:05:47.800> um<00:05:48.430> we<00:05:49.150> can

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
composition they're right here um we can

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.940 
composition they're right here um we can
rename<00:05:49.570> it<00:05:49.810> if<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.169> want<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.470> do<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.740> later

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
rename it if we want to do that later

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.520 
rename it if we want to do that later
but<00:05:51.160> so<00:05:51.639> we<00:05:51.700> got<00:05:51.849> a<00:05:51.880> shot<00:05:52.630> over<00:05:52.900> here<00:05:53.229> set<00:05:53.500> up

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
but so we got a shot over here set up

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.500 
but so we got a shot over here set up
we're<00:05:53.770> going<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.950> add<00:05:54.039> the<00:05:54.160> bullet<00:05:54.490> in<00:05:54.610> now<00:05:54.820> and

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
we're going to add the bullet in now and

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.750 
we're going to add the bullet in now and
to<00:05:55.690> do<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.840> just<00:05:56.380> look<00:05:57.010> for<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.220> composition

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
to do that just look for the composition

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.629 
to do that just look for the composition
in<00:05:57.849> your<00:05:57.940> project<00:05:58.479> file<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.050> right<00:05:59.260> here<00:05:59.740> put

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
in your project file so right here put

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.360 
in your project file so right here put
her<00:06:00.729> in<00:06:00.910> there<00:06:01.090> get<00:06:01.419> in<00:06:01.450> there<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:02.010> we<00:06:03.010> have<00:06:03.130> to

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
her in there get in there and we have to

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.350 
her in there get in there and we have to
enable<00:06:04.120> some<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:04.840> time<00:06:05.229> remapping<00:06:06.130> so<00:06:07.030> right

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
enable some it time remapping so right

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.950 
enable some it time remapping so right
click<00:06:07.630> go<00:06:08.050> to<00:06:08.289> time<00:06:09.360> enable<00:06:10.360> time<00:06:10.510> remapping

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
click go to time enable time remapping

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.710 
click go to time enable time remapping
and<00:06:11.349> because<00:06:11.680> we<00:06:12.430> got<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.669> find<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:12.970> end<00:06:13.180> of<00:06:13.510> it

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
and because we got to find the end of it

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.500 
and because we got to find the end of it
or<00:06:14.320> it<00:06:14.380> goes<00:06:14.530> black<00:06:14.919> so<00:06:15.370> we<00:06:15.639> gotta<00:06:15.849> there's<00:06:16.150> the

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
or it goes black so we gotta there's the

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.700 
or it goes black so we gotta there's the
bullet<00:06:16.840> there's<00:06:16.990> the<00:06:17.139> ball<00:06:17.289> and<00:06:17.440> then<00:06:17.500> it<00:06:17.620> just

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
bullet there's the ball and then it just

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.600 
bullet there's the ball and then it just
goes<00:06:17.970> right<00:06:18.970> there<00:06:19.240> okay<00:06:19.380> so<00:06:20.380> but<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.310> we're

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
goes right there okay so but that we're

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.120 
goes right there okay so but that we're
gonna<00:06:21.700> make<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.720> key<00:06:22.960> frame<00:06:23.260> right<00:06:23.590> here<00:06:23.650> at

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
gonna make a key frame right here at

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.909 
gonna make a key frame right here at
worthy<00:06:24.520> end<00:06:24.700> like<00:06:25.060> we're<00:06:25.270> that<00:06:25.479> last<00:06:26.169> part<00:06:26.620> of

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
worthy end like we're that last part of

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.969 
worthy end like we're that last part of
this<00:06:27.570> bullet<00:06:28.570> effect<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.050> wanna<00:06:29.229> be<00:06:29.560> is<00:06:29.680> like

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
this bullet effect you wanna be is like

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.950 
this bullet effect you wanna be is like
that<00:06:30.130> last<00:06:30.310> thing<00:06:30.550> make<00:06:30.729> your<00:06:30.880> key<00:06:31.030> frame<00:06:31.360> and

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
that last thing make your key frame and

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.890 
that last thing make your key frame and
go<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.349> beach

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
go to the beach
