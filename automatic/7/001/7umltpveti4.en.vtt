00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.370
 All humans have the instincts only 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 to help each other 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.040
 when a hiker in the mountains 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.060
 strayed, one initiates a search action 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.529
 when an earthquake destroys a city 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 send people from all over the world 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 alternative delivery 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.410
 this instinct is found in everyone 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.190
 Culture 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.190
 without spout 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 Registered early today at 4:30 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.309
 our satellites storm in the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.180
 near the ares three stations on the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.180
 market is and became more and more intense 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.270
 and we had to abort the mission 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:56.070
 but during the evacuation came 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 astronaut mark matney around the world 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.330
 I attach an official logbook to mine 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.110
 name is markwort and I'm still alive 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.460
 obviously i can neither nasa nor 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.280
 contact my blue 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
 but it would take four years anyway 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.700
 until another manned mission 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.700
 reached and this station is only for 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.530
 31 days in the face of this 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.330
 prospects remains only an option 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 I have to deal with science from the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.900
 pull shit 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.110
 ok, we expect only by I have one 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 Finding food for four years on 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.930
 we build on a planet on the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.190
 nothing grows 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.420
 but if i can not make it the nasa 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.810
 It does not matter to contact 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810
 more 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.090
 user information we have a video 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.540
 after the whole crew was received 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.540
 yes god plays 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.760
 Mark Bailey and I still have questions 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.240
 here on the beach 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.450
 why left behind 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.190
 Let's get our man 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.149
 rejected that, that is what we are talking about 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.620
 Talking is mutiny 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.750
 and if we do not have the preface 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.069
 we can destroy it 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.189
 we die the gravitation wizard 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.189
 to you 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.870
 that's the field it does not cooperate 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.870
 I guarantee you at any point 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.660
 everything just goes wrong 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.300
 and then you say that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.020
 this is my end 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.500
 is it possible that he still lives the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.500
 marsianer 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.790
 ingenious criminal or simply that is 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.790
 always want to party
