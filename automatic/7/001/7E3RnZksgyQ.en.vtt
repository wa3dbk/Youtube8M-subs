00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
just think basically go through make

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.230 
just think basically go through make
sure<00:00:25.070> twice<00:00:26.070> our<00:00:26.369> weather<00:00:26.550> says<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:26.970> because

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
sure twice our weather says two because

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
sure twice our weather says two because
the<00:00:27.359> hamsters<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.869> sometimes<00:00:28.289> mess<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:28.859> up

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

make sure anything that's gotten out of
place<00:01:32.130> goes<00:01:32.610> back<00:01:32.900> into<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.740> best<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> be

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
place goes back into it it's best to be

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.109 
place goes back into it it's best to be
and<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.850> move<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> bedding<00:01:38.119> around

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and I move some of the bedding around

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
and I move some of the bedding around
for<00:01:39.570> him<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> messes<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> up

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
for him because he kind of messes it up

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
for him because he kind of messes it up
so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.600> move<00:01:43.229> around<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.770> bedding<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> into

so I move around the bedding get it into

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.319 
so I move around the bedding get it into
all<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.860> corners<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.430> he<00:01:47.579> likes<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> dig<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.960 
all the corners that he likes to dig it
out<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> make<00:01:48.899> sure<00:01:49.049> his<00:01:49.259> wheel<00:01:49.470> spins<00:01:49.890> easy<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
out I make sure his wheel spins easy and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.160 
out I make sure his wheel spins easy and
that<00:01:51.060> bedding<00:01:51.420> doesn't<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.869> stuck

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that bedding doesn't get stuck

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.530 
that bedding doesn't get stuck
underneath<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.829> doesn't<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.180> harder

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
underneath it doesn't then it's harder

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.230 
underneath it doesn't then it's harder
for<00:01:54.630> him<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> push<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.549> his<00:01:56.759> food

pop-tarts cage and then at the bottom

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.869 
pop-tarts cage and then at the bottom
it's<00:02:16.590> usually<00:02:16.739> fine<00:02:17.129> which<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.400> where<00:02:17.700> he

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
it's usually fine which is where he

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.630 
it's usually fine which is where he
sleeps<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:19.739> don't<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.129> do<00:02:20.250> anything<00:02:20.459> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
