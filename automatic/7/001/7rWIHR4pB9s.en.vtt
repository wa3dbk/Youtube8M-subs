in<00:00:00.989> most<00:00:01.260> cases<00:00:01.500> plastic<00:00:02.010> deformation<00:00:02.490> in

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
in most cases plastic deformation in

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.039 
in most cases plastic deformation in
metals<00:00:02.879> occurs<00:00:03.240> by<00:00:03.360> dislocation<00:00:03.780> motion

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
metals occurs by dislocation motion

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.860 
metals occurs by dislocation motion
however<00:00:04.980> under<00:00:05.370> certain<00:00:05.549> conditions<00:00:06.150> plastic

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
however under certain conditions plastic

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.450 
however under certain conditions plastic
deformation<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.440> occur<00:00:07.710> by<00:00:07.919> defamation

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
deformation can occur by defamation

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
deformation can occur by defamation
twinning<00:00:08.790> instead<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.110> slide<00:00:10.380> shows

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
twinning instead so this slide shows

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
twinning instead so this slide shows
grammatically<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> difference<00:00:11.639> between

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
grammatically the difference between

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.070 
grammatically the difference between
dislocation<00:00:12.360> motion<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> deformation

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
dislocation motion and deformation

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.259 
dislocation motion and deformation
twinning<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:14.670> worth<00:00:14.820> pointing<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.179> that

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
twinning it's worth pointing out that

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
twinning it's worth pointing out that
this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> single<00:00:16.049> crystal<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
this is just for a single crystal but of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
this is just for a single crystal but of
course<00:00:17.250> both<00:00:17.460> occur<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.150> poly<00:00:18.330> crystals<00:00:18.720> as

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
course both occur in poly crystals as

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.220 
course both occur in poly crystals as
well<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.970> dislocation<00:00:21.359> motion<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
well so in dislocation motion that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.859 
well so in dislocation motion that
occurs<00:00:22.410> by<00:00:23.070> by<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.820> movement<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> many

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
occurs by by the movement of many

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.630 
occurs by by the movement of many
dislocations<00:00:26.060> along<00:00:27.060> slip<00:00:27.630> planes<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.640> so

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
dislocations along slip planes and so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.859 
dislocations along slip planes and so
this<00:00:29.789> doesn't<00:00:30.060> show<00:00:30.179> individual

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
this doesn't show individual

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
this doesn't show individual
dislocations<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.769> shows<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> net

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
dislocations it just shows that the net

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.860 
dislocations it just shows that the net
effect<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> different<00:00:33.570> regions

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
effect is that we have different regions

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
effect is that we have different regions
of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> crystal<00:00:34.590> displaced<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.280> respect<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of the crystal displaced with respect to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.760 
of the crystal displaced with respect to
each<00:00:35.820> other

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
each other

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.869 
each other
defamation<00:00:37.770> twinning<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> other<00:00:38.640> hand

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
defamation twinning on the other hand

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
defamation twinning on the other hand
occurs<00:00:39.540> by<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> cooperative<00:00:40.200> shear<00:00:40.559> movement

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
occurs by the cooperative shear movement

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
occurs by the cooperative shear movement
of<00:00:41.040> many<00:00:41.219> atoms<00:00:41.960> all<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> atoms<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.620> move

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of many atoms all of the atoms they move

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.990 
of many atoms all of the atoms they move
at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> same<00:00:44.070> time<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> same<00:00:44.820> direction

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
at the same time in the same direction

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.819 
at the same time in the same direction
and<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.930> direction<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> twinning

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and that direction is the twinning

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
and that direction is the twinning
direction<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> net<00:00:48.600> effect<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.140> we

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
direction so the net effect is that we

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
direction so the net effect is that we
recreate<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> same<00:00:50.039> crystal<00:00:50.280> structure<00:00:50.640> here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
recreate the same crystal structure here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.189 
recreate the same crystal structure here
in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> middle<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> different

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
in the middle but just in a different

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
in the middle but just in a different
orientation<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> bit<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
orientation so the bit here this is a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
orientation so the bit here this is a
twin<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> same<00:00:56.399> structure<00:00:56.789> as

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
twin and it's got the same structure as

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
twin and it's got the same structure as
the<00:00:56.910> parent<00:00:57.390> parent<00:00:58.230> structure<00:00:58.469> but

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the parent parent structure but

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
the parent parent structure but
reflected<00:00:59.520> across<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> twin<00:01:00.120> twin

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
reflected across the twin twin

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
reflected across the twin twin
boundaries<00:01:01.609> it's<00:01:02.609> worth<00:01:02.730> pointing<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
boundaries it's worth pointing out that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
boundaries it's worth pointing out that
if<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.570> structure<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.470> different<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
if this structure was different to the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
if this structure was different to the
parent<00:01:05.400> structure<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.570> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
parent structure then this would have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
parent structure then this would have
been<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> martensitic<00:01:07.140> transformation<00:01:07.400> in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
been a martensitic transformation in

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
been a martensitic transformation in
this<00:01:08.939> demonstration<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this demonstration we're going to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
this demonstration we're going to
illustrate<00:01:10.110> defamation<00:01:10.950> twinning<00:01:11.280> using

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
illustrate defamation twinning using

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.359 
illustrate defamation twinning using
these<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:12.090> bars<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.510> freshly<00:01:12.720> Caston<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.159> tin

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
these two bars of freshly Caston so tin

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
these two bars of freshly Caston so tin
has<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> trigonal<00:01:15.210> crystal<00:01:15.540> structure<00:01:15.900> which

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
has a trigonal crystal structure which

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
has a trigonal crystal structure which
is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.710> lower<00:01:16.890> symmetry<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.430> raised

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is a much lower symmetry than raised

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880 
is a much lower symmetry than raised
metals<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.750> makes<00:01:18.990> disco<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.680> makes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
metals which makes disco which makes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
metals which makes disco which makes
dislocation<00:01:20.280> motion<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.790> difficult<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
dislocation motion more difficult and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
dislocation motion more difficult and
therefore<00:01:21.869> favors<00:01:22.350> defamation<00:01:22.799> twinning<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
therefore favors defamation twinning so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
therefore favors defamation twinning so
I'm<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> take<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.540> bars<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I'm going to take one of these bars and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.390 
I'm going to take one of these bars and
I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> heat<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.920> using<00:01:26.220> freshly

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
I'm going to heat it up using freshly

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:43.450 
I'm going to heat it up using freshly
boiled<00:01:26.580> water

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.289 

so<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> leave<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.940> there<00:01:45.240> for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so I'm going to leave that there for

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
so I'm going to leave that there for
just<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.690> while<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> meantime

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
just a little while and in the meantime

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
just a little while and in the meantime
I'm<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> take<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> bar<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I'm going to take this bar that's just

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
I'm going to take this bar that's just
at<00:01:48.990> room<00:01:49.140> temperature<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
at room temperature and I'm going to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
at room temperature and I'm going to
bend<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> quite

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
bend it and I'm going to do that quite

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
bend it and I'm going to do that quite
close<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.380> microphone<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.340> should

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
close to the microphone and you should

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.500 
close to the microphone and you should
be<00:01:53.549> able<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> hear<00:01:53.940> why<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> second

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.000 

so<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.260> going<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.500> take<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.860> that's

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
so now I'm going to take the one that's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.830 
so now I'm going to take the one that's
been<00:02:05.130> heating<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:06.390> exactly<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.810> same

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
been heating up and do exactly the same

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:22.380 
been heating up and do exactly the same
thing<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.550 

will<00:02:23.390> consider<00:02:23.719> the<00:02:23.840> rim<00:02:23.989> temperature<00:02:24.379> case

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
will consider the rim temperature case

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.229 
will consider the rim temperature case
first<00:02:24.829> when<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.549> bend<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.879> bar

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
first when I bend the bar

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.089 
first when I bend the bar
defamation<00:02:26.510> twinning<00:02:27.079> took<00:02:27.230> place<00:02:27.409> and<00:02:27.739> we

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
defamation twinning took place and we

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.559 
defamation twinning took place and we
heard<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.370> characteristic<00:02:29.030> crackling<00:02:29.329> noise

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
heard a characteristic crackling noise

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.559 
heard a characteristic crackling noise
known<00:02:30.170> as<00:02:30.290> Tim<00:02:30.500> cry<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:32.060> reason<00:02:32.299> we<00:02:32.390> heard

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
known as Tim cry the reason we heard

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.539 
known as Tim cry the reason we heard
this<00:02:32.719> noise<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.290> because<00:02:33.739> during<00:02:33.980> defamation

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
this noise is because during defamation

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.580 
this noise is because during defamation

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
have noticed that no noise was generated

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.479 
have noticed that no noise was generated
in<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.629> sample<00:02:53.930> at<00:02:53.989> 100<00:02:54.290> degrees<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.189> reason

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
in the sample at 100 degrees the reason

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.009 
in the sample at 100 degrees the reason
for<00:02:55.609> this<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.000> related<00:02:56.419> to<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.569> relative<00:02:56.900> ease

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
for this is related to the relative ease

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.390 
for this is related to the relative ease
with<00:02:57.260> which<00:02:57.379> defamation<00:02:57.980> twinning<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
with which defamation twinning and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.670 
with which defamation twinning and
dislocation<00:02:58.819> motion<00:02:59.060> take<00:02:59.389> place<00:02:59.599> so<00:03:00.409> this<00:03:00.530> is

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
dislocation motion take place so this is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.110 
dislocation motion take place so this is
illustrated<00:03:01.159> schematically<00:03:01.549> in<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:01.879> slide

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
illustrated schematically in this slide

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.390 
illustrated schematically in this slide
which<00:03:02.930> plots<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.439> critical<00:03:03.799> stress<00:03:04.069> for<00:03:04.310> each

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
which plots the critical stress for each

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.309 
which plots the critical stress for each
type<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.609> defamation<00:03:04.939> to<00:03:05.269> occur<00:03:05.540> against<00:03:06.230> the

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
type of defamation to occur against the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.039 
type of defamation to occur against the
temperature<00:03:07.329> dislocation<00:03:08.329> motion<00:03:08.629> is

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
temperature dislocation motion is

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.170 
temperature dislocation motion is
thermally<00:03:09.379> activated<00:03:09.799> so<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.849> see<00:03:11.030> that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
thermally activated so you can see that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300 
thermally activated so you can see that
it<00:03:11.299> occurs<00:03:11.569> much<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:11.840> easily<00:03:12.169> at<00:03:12.560> higher

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it occurs much more easily at higher

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.209 
it occurs much more easily at higher
temperatures<00:03:14.500> twinning<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.859> other<00:03:15.980> hand

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
temperatures twinning on the other hand

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.789 
temperatures twinning on the other hand
is<00:03:16.569> almost<00:03:17.569> independent<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.200> temperature<00:03:18.379> and

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
is almost independent of temperature and

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.649 
is almost independent of temperature and
can<00:03:19.250> also<00:03:19.400> occur<00:03:19.760> at<00:03:19.909> high<00:03:20.030> strain<00:03:20.090> rates

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
can also occur at high strain rates

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.420 
can also occur at high strain rates
so<00:03:21.319> therefore<00:03:21.469> twinning<00:03:21.919> tends<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.310> be

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
so therefore twinning tends to be

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.369 
so therefore twinning tends to be
favored<00:03:22.939> at<00:03:23.120> low<00:03:23.480> temperatures<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.229> high

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
favored at low temperatures and high

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.159 
favored at low temperatures and high
strain<00:03:24.680> rates<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.150> art<00:03:26.299> wit<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.870> art<00:03:27.019> in

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
strain rates so in art wit in art in

sample the the one at room temperature

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.750 
sample the the one at room temperature
we<00:03:30.650> saw<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:30.949> defamation<00:03:31.459> twinning

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
we saw that defamation twinning

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.069 
we saw that defamation twinning
dominated<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.329> we<00:03:32.419> must<00:03:32.540> have<00:03:32.599> been<00:03:32.780> down<00:03:32.900> here

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
dominated so we must have been down here

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.610 
dominated so we must have been down here
somewhere

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
somewhere

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.649
