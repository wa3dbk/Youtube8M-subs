00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.349
 the opel the last duel for our knowledge and toshiba folio 100 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.980
 the first trailer that was marketed by both in November last 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.789
 year 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.240
 and afterwards about the introduction was quite a lot to do because among other things in 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.649
 England a number of providers 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.399
 Immediately after the winter break the device is withdrawn from the market because it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.399
 according to him it would not function properly 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.340
 all the more reason for us to see today what is true of this one 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.150
 claims and and poor he is still being sold at this time 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.610
 also ask us if that is justified 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.840
 or that the stories that the competition was distributed are based on truth 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.040
 it's the income and that 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.900
 rest and by 2002 and he has 16 kilometer storage division 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.350
 it does the company no 3d support 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 a window at the front has a camera of a few 3 megapixels 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.570
 the right side we see the standard and opens 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.200
 to go back to the home screen to go back to god 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.850
 settings 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.049
 among them are two plastic cups 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.540
 with stereo sound 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.960
 so also look at the bottom 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.149
 then a docking can always be used 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.480
 in this connection 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 and see side with a well hidden behind a cover 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.350
 and HDMI output and now I bought and if displayport 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 and this can come knife stabs and gunshot wounds 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.620
 and on the other hand there is a ditch on the screen unprotected 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.360
 so it can't follow 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.220
 when turning on the device, it appears to be a standard at first sight 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.310
 interface with a number of desk drawer that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.560
 and on the promenade you can place applications a bit like we are used to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.690
 I have changed a number of things 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.799
 why is this also allowed for the application collection 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.059
 it is now possible to change this to a bar 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.059
 leaving you without losing that background 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.459
 very easily mixed role 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.979
 the meerendonk lidy of the brothers of late but again see 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.269
 tom is still possible but full screen after all applications 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.209
 displayed 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.679
 In addition, there are a number of caesarean sections 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.959
 after the tablet 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.649
 that they have developed themselves 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.649
 an application to watch videos 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.809
 Spice the video slopers smoothly also the sound will be a harman 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.669
 guarantee good quality 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.240
 recommended 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.200
 the screen performs well on father's day when playing video 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.889
 but for more viewing the screen in the standard insured interface 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.019
 fonts look what it all started sharply on board 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:14.369
 but I did not know this either but it seems like the door and the JosÃ©e 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.809
 vs are not entirely tailored to the use of this format screen 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.689
 make the browser or documents available for a fact 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.480
 fine now and then it is what the bank reacted to 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.539
 the browser itself sometimes scrolls some cars around and then it does indeed 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.499
 Flowing 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.079
 which is not always as you see 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.200
 And you can't be sure that this is a clear reason 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.459
 point out why it sometimes works better than the other times 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.049
 Another drawback is that the interest rate is testing on the side that dream 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.049
 they have not used any lighting 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:59.049
 That was now we are in a bad light for employees as well 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.449
 already busy for the right one 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.150
 or they get it in addition, there are no more for the pvda did agree 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.790
 as said, use is made of plans to leave a second 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.719
 But that is unfortunately meant exclusively for licensed applications 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.439
 hundreds and tortured toshiba has its own pity for but that 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.319
 is not nearly as good as and we make 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.419
 and the applications and facilities among others are therefore not included with 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.699
 the device 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.569
 a walk that must be said is that the meat should support 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.860
 but go again a bottle on this come on the internet 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.629
 symbols especially when you see a collection of unclear characters and after 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.629
 a haunting way, therefore, not well supported 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.150
 play games fluently 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.509
 arsenal 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.880
 So hard work the day is healthy 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.960
 fine but it seems that the software is not quite tasty 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.900
 tuned to the a2 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.320
 in conclusion can say that the hardware is moderately good but it does 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.919
 device before it's in the field of software but it's getting bothered 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.720
 not always good not everything works equally friendly and there it was 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.280
 look forward to a price that is currently around 400 euros still more 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.499
 we would definitely not recommend this device to buy because it is in that 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.499
 price range to find much better alternatives 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.909
 thanks for the attention there is still everything on each other's points but that is 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.930
