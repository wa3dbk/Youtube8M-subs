00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.030
 where I present you cadence is the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.290
 my sister 's mare wears very 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.119
 well his name we will be able to work 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:26.450
 precisely the pace and regularity 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:28.070
 strides with this mare a crowd 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.599
 and it's just the distance that 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.450
 separates from successive ask the same into 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.570
 down there we can tangle the pencils on 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.430
 mechanism of the gallop we have the posterior a 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.720
 diagonal and the inside and that 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.280
 again diagonal posterior 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.930
 prior to feeling a good 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.190
 crowd and well the counties have to trust 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.110
 precisely at this time of projections that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.070
 mark the stride well that is to say that 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.690
 it's still pretty clear when we 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.980
 is on his horse that there is some 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.180
 something that happens a little jump somewhere 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.650
 thing that's going on it feels pretty 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.910
 clearly there are other little clues 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.140
 can help us to horse often 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.579
 that they breathe a rhythm with his 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.850
 strides and it's always rhythmic that the 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.290
 skin series and that's marked by 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.699
 every stride to help you 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.020
 count me I have a little exercise with 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.060
 ground bars that mark each 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.340
 stride alas we have the projection time 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.499
 and turn a little jump and that's it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.590
 helps you feel each stride of 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:17.090
 very clear way for the little exercise 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.439
 that I have prepared you I place my stockings 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 at 3 meters from each other in 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.280
 doing three big steps 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.469
 3 it may not look a little short 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.259
 because a crowd is normally she 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.299
 is 3 meters 50 on a course of 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.209
 horse shows and can go up 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.350
 four meters 5 m cross but here we 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.729
 is on bars it's not about 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.590
 height so the horses take less 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.119
 amplitude and then a cigalo strike 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.009
 gymnastics work 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.209
 that's where I go on my line 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.209
 with mebara 3 m 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.240
 and well against the crowds and because 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.670
 in the jumping routes 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.640
 we have lines of two obstacles that 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.380
 are at relative distance so we have 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.030
 four five next stride 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 the interpretation we make when we 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.770
 Walking the path that it is essential 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.090
 you really need to know 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 this all the courses from a 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.640
 certain level we can not 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.110
 go out without knowing what we're doing at 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.550
 middle of the lines it's really the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.950
 key point of the jump technique 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.000
 obstacles or 2,3 and sow attention to 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.530
 small traps when its account 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.270
 stride in a line you have to do 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 be careful not to count as stride 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.870
 the jump the entry jump of the line this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.280
 we often tend to do it 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.560
 force himself to count zero on the jump 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.790
 entry and counted 1 once we got 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.100
 received and start the first 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.090
 stride we will raise the first and the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.570
 last bar to make small 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:41.020
 obstacles as if I had a line 012 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:48.190
 believe but see a rate that is 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.120
 very happy to work 0123 must 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 now that we master well be 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.400
 exercise with the bars we will try to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.350
 count them in the same way the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.790
 crowds and without the bars and since we have 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.930
 perished even barras to be able to vary do 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.930
 three or four strides 0 1 2 or 3 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:16.849
 1 2 3 0123 esso hop and mixing the 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.290
 this add a fourth I need 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.670
 of a very available horse I'm going 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 can vary a little bit the amplitude of my 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.560
 strides 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.439
 I'm lying on the big side 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.730
 gather on the small side for 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.400
 to lengthen it is enough to accompany well 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.709
 the movement of the horse with its pelvis 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.569
 and with his arms and hands for 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.200
 gather you have to sit down more 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.370
 heavily in his scene straighten and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.370
 well support his show with his legs 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.329
 especially not block his hands think that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:51.330
 the little pace she is ready I 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:55.930
 brings together 0 1 2 3 4 and soco very moved 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.970
 01/02 takes four networks and here is a 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.049
 well dreaming then there I did four 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.730
 strides but I could not do two 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.930
 because it's good to vary 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.700
 crowds and remove to add one 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.650
 in a line but on a line 3 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 stride to remove one is a little bit 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.860
 dangerous it's a little bit too much 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.299
 put the horse in a clip too to 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.890
 dish we can have a bad jump and 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.390
 maybe a fall he is more careful 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.950
 to do this kind of exercise to take off 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.739
 a crowd and when you already have a 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.720
 line that makes nature 5 stride at 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.949
 below it is a bit risky so 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.270
 for now what we are trying to 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.270
 add unsa there is no risk 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.879
 Well, here we have worked well on 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.509
 this exercise for the crowds and I I 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.370
 advise you to redo it 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.860
 regularly at home it's really going 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.849
 help you tell his stride and that 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.740
 is going to be a key point for you a 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.930
 course so I hope that will make you 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.379
 win and we end up on the podiums 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.379
 see you soon
