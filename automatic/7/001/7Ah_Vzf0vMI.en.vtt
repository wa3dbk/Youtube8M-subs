00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.339

 the brown river that cuts the city rose three meters above the normal level 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.740
 modest house collapsed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 the force of the water has opened a hole in the wall of this other one that runs the risk of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.740
 fall 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740

 What was on the clothesline? 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.310
 arriving a little closer to the house we notice that the water has entered 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.500

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.380
 and electronic payments from customers who were at home more than 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.580

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.990
