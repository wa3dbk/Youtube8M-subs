00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good people from youtube today I'm going to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.170
 show how to do a reflux 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.500
 without the need to open the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.969
 computer as we can see here we have 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.969
 a 5 hp DVD 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.220
 there is no image 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.580
 there is distilling the key 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.500
 and here is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.330
 let's go to work it to see 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.620
 ready 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.940
 so for this we're just going to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.720
 need extra for tico this is a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.720
 hair dryer 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.500
 as you can see normal 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.890
 and then we proceed to turn off the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.890
 computer 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.350
 ready now 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.660
 and place the dryer is the most 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 but hot as hot as 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.990
 we can 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.360
 here it says that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 very hot are the two things for 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 down and let's turn it on we close the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 computer 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 and we're going to make that air come in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.049
 the slots so that by means of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.270
 slots reach up to the video card 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.670
 the video chip that was pretty much 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.390
 around here what he is going to do is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.700
 heat the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.700
 and through that way he's going to give us 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 video ready then we proceed 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.580
 how can they if you can play in 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 that moment overheats the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.000
 computer 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.290
 then we will try 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.290
 comes down 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 and there we can see turned on the computer 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.420
 it's a home reflex 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.420
 which points materials that we can 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.569
 we can fix our computer this 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.180
 it's a temporary way to fix it 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.510
 I do not want to say that it will be for them 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.390
 always good but yes or it does not have a 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.660
 estimated time then of arrangement so 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.480
 except I am doing this every each 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.519
 every time it happens to me and I 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.220
 It works really well or either after 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.069
 that the computer is on does not fail 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.420
 it does not have any problem here we can 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.420
 see if starting 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.129
 perfect 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.530
 we have it all 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.220
 No problem 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.220
 13 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.180
 perfect everything is perfect 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.040
 so basically it 's having a dryer 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.960
 place it in the hottest thing that is 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.449
 I may have the computer turned off 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.139
 throw the air because it is going to get the air 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.380
 through the slots ready more or less a 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.210
 Not long time because drying 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.789
 it generates too much heat and you can finish 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.620
 damage them then only for a 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.590
 short estimated time as we can see 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.849
 now we do it and there it is ready 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.849
 computer in sallent
