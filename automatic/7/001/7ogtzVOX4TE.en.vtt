00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 nice all guys i'm the first ed 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 here we are with this brand new video there 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.040
 we find on gta 5 now I will show you the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.349
 lease of the car faster than the game 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 is what car should be the most 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.509
 fast of the game the bugatti and it is found 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 exactly in this point here 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.380
 exactly here so maybe take 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.689
 as a reference point the store i 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.900
 clothes or the barber here by the ha 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.750
 hair or here is the house of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.269
 michael therefore more or less in this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 point here so maybe now I do 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 see the moment the holy st e e 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.950
 so right there the car and this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 so obviously we start immediately at 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.290
 steal it and maybe let's change it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 so much to see for a moment how much 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.870
 if it's really the fastest car in the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.770
 game 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 then let's go if i leave maybe we go to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.940
 see here it is 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.940
 maybe when I love ok 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.840
 perfect immediately we go to crash 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.190
 against the trees 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 ok then as changes I have it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.750
 unlock them all because going forward 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.860
 in the game but right now I 'm the one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 twentieth mission on 69 unlocked 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 we all say the car modifications 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 the only change that you will take 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 after that it is the tire one 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 bulletproof if I'm not mistaken and that 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.440
 unlock later and when you need to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 rob me it seems like a bale bank that 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.220
 he even saw the video 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.350
 so now let's start a little bit at 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 then change it first 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.410
 let's take armor 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.130
 maximum pure engine brakes as well i 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.970
 honking the last the coolest xenon 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.259
 xeno cool the license plate because more 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.940
 funny 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.039
 so I always like colors 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.000
 always put it like we say the contrast 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:05.960
 between black and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 and then the oil the orange or the green and the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.940
 lime green so I wanted to do it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.470
 or maybe with the green so lose 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.820
 racing and then let's take the suspension 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.820
 the race transmission from the race then turbo 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.070
 custom tube wheels 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.230
 here wheels goes well here is what comments 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 in fact, for others, let's put on the smoke 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.230
 red which should be the most expensive 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.160
 so the coolest 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.180
 then the limousine windows and then that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.800
 other wheels are missing here 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.480
 types of wheels let's put on that luxury 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.930
 it should be this thing more expensive 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.180
 and then rims colors here we go 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.330
 a little bit I do not for love here and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.489
 there the green ones because now we do it 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.110
 green and therefore lime green should 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.090
 be ok not green pea green line 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.820
 ok so here is a little bit should 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.190
 is already starting to take shape 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.570
 ok i think i'm done and then 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.519
 should be the car at all 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.070
 faster effects of the game now let's see 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.820
 a bit if it's really like that but I think 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.490
 yes indeed 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.320
 already part great 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.600
 here we put immediately under this 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.930
 Mrs 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 ok yes yes yes the fastest car in the game 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.960
 in effect perfect now that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.890
 we park exactly at this point 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.480
 we can say goodbye ok nothing this 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.700
 video is over we will definitely see a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.700
 next nice video all the guys
