00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
37 degrees Fahrenheit and I thought this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.689 
37 degrees Fahrenheit and I thought this
day<00:00:23.070> would<00:00:23.189> never<00:00:23.250> come

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699

but<00:00:24.420> slowly<00:00:25.170> we'll<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.250> uncovering<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> palms

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
but slowly we'll be uncovering the palms

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.150 
but slowly we'll be uncovering the palms
now<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.810> finally<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.500> into<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> stretch

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
now we're finally going into a stretch

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060 
now we're finally going into a stretch
of<00:00:29.330> spring-like<00:00:30.330> mild<00:00:30.660> temperatures<00:00:31.260> stuff

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of spring-like mild temperatures stuff

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.540 
of spring-like mild temperatures stuff
that<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.270> trackies<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.260> needles<00:00:34.620> can

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that the the trackies the needles can

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.869 
that the the trackies the needles can
Sables<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.540> easily<00:00:36.930> take<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.920> slowly<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.670> need

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
Sables can easily take so slowly I need

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
a giant pile of snow still here that's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.459 
a giant pile of snow still here that's
frozen<00:00:43.940> but<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> 40s

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
frozen but it's going to be in the 40s

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
frozen but it's going to be in the 40s
now<00:00:46.940> mostly<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> next<00:00:48.629> week<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> then

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
now mostly for the next week and then

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
now mostly for the next week and then
we'll<00:00:49.320> slowly<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.190> into<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> 50s

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we'll slowly start to get into the 50s

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.970 
we'll slowly start to get into the 50s
and<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.329> still<00:00:52.079> may<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:52.469> snow<00:00:52.710> but

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and up still may have some snow but

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.400 
and up still may have some snow but
probably<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.760> likely<00:00:54.260> can<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
probably not as likely can I have a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
probably not as likely can I have a
little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> wet<00:00:55.949> snow<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> mornings

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
little bit of wet snow in the mornings

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.369 
little bit of wet snow in the mornings
things<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.629> it'll<00:00:57.870> turn<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.199> rain

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
things like that but it'll turn to rain

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so I'm gonna cover this track here it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
so I'm gonna cover this track here it
was<00:01:01.680> covered<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.370> tarp<00:01:02.609> some<00:01:03.180> slits<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
was covered with a tarp some slits in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.550 
was covered with a tarp some slits in
the<00:01:03.870> tarp<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> breed<00:01:05.780> also<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the tarp for it to breed also there is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.070 
the tarp for it to breed also there is
25<00:01:08.430> c9<00:01:09.090> bulbs<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> 35<00:01:11.250> 45<00:01:12.080> thermal

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
25 c9 bulbs in there on a 35 45 thermal

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
25 c9 bulbs in there on a 35 45 thermal
queue<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.430> I've<00:01:14.610> used<00:01:14.880> inside<00:01:15.240> you'll

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
queue and all I've used inside you'll

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
queue and all I've used inside you'll
see<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> cage<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
see is like a cage and there's like a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.800 
see is like a cage and there's like a
piece<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> wood<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.570> you're

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
piece of wood in there I know you're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
piece of wood in there I know you're
gonna<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.140> damage<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.680> palm<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.130> don't

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
gonna see damage on this palm I don't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
gonna see damage on this palm I don't
think<00:01:20.700> we're<00:01:20.790> gonna<00:01:20.909> find<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.479> fungus

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
think we're gonna find any fungus

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
think we're gonna find any fungus
because<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> slits<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because of the slits but I think the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
because of the slits but I think the
fronds<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> damaged<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.080> find

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
fronds will be damaged we're gonna find

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.490 
fronds will be damaged we're gonna find
out<00:01:26.420> some<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> tarp<00:01:27.840> may<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.320> off

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
out some of the tarp may not come off

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
out some of the tarp may not come off
because<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.430> frozen<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.909> ground

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
because it's still frozen to the ground

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:47.410 
because it's still frozen to the ground
but<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.630> gonna<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.079> much<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.530> off

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.170 

had<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> couple<00:01:48.600> bungee<00:01:49.049> cords<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.530> there

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
had a couple bungee cords on there

00:01:50.180 --> 00:02:42.740 
had a couple bungee cords on there
holding<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> tarp<00:01:51.510> on

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.220 

even<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:45.210> snakes<00:02:46.210> are<00:02:46.420> frozen<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.990> ground

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
even the snakes are frozen in the ground

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.890 
even the snakes are frozen in the ground
but<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> look<00:02:51.330> way<00:02:52.330> better<00:02:52.570> than<00:02:52.750> last

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
but have a look way better than last

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
year last year this palm as you can see

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080 
year last year this palm as you can see
here<00:02:54.820> was<00:02:54.940> trunk<00:02:55.480> cut<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.550> here<00:02:57.910> wasn't

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
here was trunk cut and this here wasn't

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.320 
here was trunk cut and this here wasn't
where<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.360> was<00:02:58.480> cut<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.960> then<00:02:59.920> up<00:03:00.220> here<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.670> all
