00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.450
 the friboi brand is the home market she 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.770
 big player 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.390
 we are not used to a 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.710
 supermarket in the butcher shop and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.599
 meat by brand 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.250
 What are we doing now in this 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.420
 movement of the Friboi with the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.280
 tony ramos is putting brand on face for 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.720

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 Come and see Macau, I'm just not going. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.510
 In this house I did not see Tony and I did not even 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.070
 I even realized that I could put the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.769
 brand in the flesh because we looked and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.089
 Said so good the melon has water mark 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.940
 there are woods that are products that 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.860
 theoretically have the same characteristic 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.750
 as in product policy even then 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.090
 because meat does not have kills then we 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.799
 looking at this opportunity he said man has 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.990
 one will have the opportunity to put 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.970
 brand that is adding value where 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.020
 today I did not even have how the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.020

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.780
 the way when the client called us 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.120
 he looked at this question with this 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 opportunity he had in the lemon hand 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.010
 was unused and at the same time was 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 very well explained 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.650
 millions of people that we wanted 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.640
 to show consumers what it was 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.680
 expensive because they had a vehicle that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.710

 usual consumption of meat then the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.959

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.260
 It was even a question in a big city. 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.540
 You have to make sure the meat is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.320

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.970
 rare and with a quality standard and also 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.860
 with the images of the factory behind I think 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.810
 helped the consumer understand 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.540
 any differential in this product as 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.730
 is that we do the production of meat in the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.270
 our day to day results so far 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.840
 they are wonderful because 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.210
 We have a serious super research and 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.310

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.230
 people are clinging and we realize 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.450
 already in the first movement and the people of 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.900
 clinging are wanting to do so 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.900
 wanting to 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.590
 when we get a consumer 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.510
 repeat and take action upon arriving at 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.270
