00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.599 

now<00:00:27.449> before<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.840> plant<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.470> tomato<00:00:28.800> plant<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
now before we plant this tomato plant I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
now before we plant this tomato plant I
want<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> show<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> something<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.500> off

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
want to show you something first off

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.530 
want to show you something first off
we're<00:00:31.920> gonna<00:00:32.040> plant<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> down<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:34.620> about<00:00:34.710> here

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080 

if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:39.989> along<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.160> stem<00:00:41.489> you'll<00:00:41.850> see

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
if you look along the stem you'll see

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
if you look along the stem you'll see
what<00:00:42.239> appears<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:43.110> hundreds<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.860> little

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
what appears to be hundreds of little

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.690 
what appears to be hundreds of little
hairs<00:00:45.289> well<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.530> tell<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.160> roots<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
hairs well they tell me that roots are

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.860 
hairs well they tell me that roots are
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> form<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.989> those<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.500> hairs

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
going to form from those little hairs

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.830 
going to form from those little hairs
making<00:00:51.870> your<00:00:52.140> plants<00:00:52.530> stronger<00:00:53.100> healthier

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
making your plants stronger healthier

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.439 
making your plants stronger healthier
maybe<00:00:54.840> even<00:00:55.170> make<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> few<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.710> tomatoes<00:00:56.449> as

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
maybe even make a few more tomatoes as

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660 
maybe even make a few more tomatoes as

with some compost we've got the hole dug

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
with some compost we've got the hole dug
out<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> plant<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:07.979> let's<00:01:08.280> plant<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
out for the plant and now let's plant it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.830 
out for the plant and now let's plant it
I<00:01:10.610> want<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> show<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.000> little<00:01:12.240> trick<00:01:12.479> before

I want to show you a little trick before
we<00:01:13.110> put<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> ground<00:01:14.960> although<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
we put it in the ground although it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
we put it in the ground although it's
advertised<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> roots<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.150> come

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
advertised that the roots will come

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
advertised that the roots will come
through<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> peat<00:01:19.140> pots<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.970> won't<00:01:20.970> affect

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
through the peat pots and won't affect

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.690 
through the peat pots and won't affect
the<00:01:21.420> plant<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.869> all<00:01:22.049> well<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:24.299> found<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.470> be

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the plant at all well I found that to be

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
the plant at all well I found that to be
let's<00:01:26.700> say<00:01:26.970> untrue<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
let's say untrue so what I do is I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.160 
let's say untrue so what I do is I
simply<00:01:29.820> pinch<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.450> bottom<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> cup

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
simply pinch off the bottom of the cup

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
simply pinch off the bottom of the cup
which<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> allow<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.610> roots<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
which is going to allow the roots to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.160 
which is going to allow the roots to
grow<00:01:40.159> freely<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:42.240> fact<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> bunch

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
grow freely in fact you can see a bunch

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.660 
grow freely in fact you can see a bunch
of<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.500> sticking<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.100> already

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.789 

usually<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.810> plants<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> don't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
usually with other plants that you don't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.990 
usually with other plants that you don't
cover<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.060> stem<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.890> also<00:01:52.890> pinch<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.759> top

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
cover the stem I also pinch off the top

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
cover the stem I also pinch off the top
rim<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.979> keeps<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.759> peat<00:01:57.719> pot<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.290> wicking

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
rim that keeps the peat pot from wicking

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.090 
rim that keeps the peat pot from wicking
the<00:01:59.040> moisture<00:02:00.049> away<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> plant<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the moisture away from the plant and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.450 
the moisture away from the plant and
drying<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> since<00:02:04.890> we're<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> cover

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
drying up so since we're going to cover

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.110 
drying up so since we're going to cover
this<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> pinch<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.780> off

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.120 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.570 

we<00:02:10.120> gotta<00:02:10.330> set<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.630> down<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:14.260> we're<00:02:14.770> gonna<00:02:14.860> add

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
we gotta set it down and we're gonna add

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:26.240 
we gotta set it down and we're gonna add
some<00:02:15.940> dirt
