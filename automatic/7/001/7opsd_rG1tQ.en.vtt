00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.220 
I apply this you'll be able to see that
poolside<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.940> little<00:03:37.269> bit<00:03:37.360> more<00:03:37.540> sheer<00:03:37.959> than

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
poolside is a little bit more sheer than

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.290 
poolside is a little bit more sheer than
the<00:03:38.530> rest<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> shades<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:40.000> me<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> think

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
the rest of the shades for me I think

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.930 
the rest of the shades for me I think
that<00:03:40.480> works<00:03:40.780> nicely<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.489> put<00:03:42.700> something

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
that works nicely if I put something

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.030 
that works nicely if I put something
like<00:03:43.060> too<00:03:43.540> too<00:03:44.080> pigmented<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.709> can<00:03:44.830> look<00:03:44.980> a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
like too too pigmented it can look a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.290 
like too too pigmented it can look a
little<00:03:45.070> bit<00:03:45.340> harsh<00:03:45.610> on<00:03:45.730> my<00:03:45.850> lower<00:03:46.030> lash<00:03:46.269> line

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
little bit harsh on my lower lash line

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.350 
little bit harsh on my lower lash line
but<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.500> really<00:03:47.950> pretty<00:03:48.850> shape<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.269> if

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
but this is really pretty shape but if

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.270 
but this is really pretty shape but if
you<00:03:49.450> want<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.720> bit<00:03:49.840> more<00:03:49.870> pigmented<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.709> can't

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
you want a bit more pigmented you can't

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280 
you want a bit more pigmented you can't
apply<00:03:51.550> these<00:03:51.790> shadows<00:03:52.150> wet<00:03:52.420> or<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.810> could<00:03:53.080> put

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
apply these shadows wet or you could put

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.280 
apply these shadows wet or you could put
down<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.530> some

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
down a some

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.250 
down a some
a<00:03:54.319> liner<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.670> then<00:03:55.879> put<00:03:56.150> poolside<00:03:56.450> over<00:03:57.079> top

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
a liner and then put poolside over top

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.429 
a liner and then put poolside over top
of<00:03:57.439> that<00:03:57.560> liner<00:03:58.450> using<00:03:59.450> poolside<00:03:59.840> on<00:04:00.230> that

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
of that liner using poolside on that

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.500 
of that liner using poolside on that
large<00:04:00.890> pencil<00:04:01.219> brush<00:04:01.519> gave<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.969> little<00:04:02.239> bit<00:04:02.420> of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
large pencil brush gave a little bit of

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.899 
large pencil brush gave a little bit of
a<00:04:02.599> diffused<00:04:03.200> look<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.620> my<00:04:03.709> lower<00:04:03.920> lashline<00:04:04.310> but

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
a diffused look to my lower lashline but

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.729 
a diffused look to my lower lashline but

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
right at the base I want the color to be

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.319 
right at the base I want the color to be
a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:07.219> bit<00:04:07.340> more<00:04:07.489> saturated<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.150> I'm<00:04:08.209> going

paid special attention to my lower

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.680 
paid special attention to my lower
lashes<00:04:39.620> because<00:04:40.099> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.940> blue<00:04:41.479> is<00:04:41.660> just

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
lashes because I think that blue is just

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.890 
lashes because I think that blue is just
so<00:04:42.139> pretty<00:04:42.470> peeking<00:04:42.919> out<00:04:43.039> of<00:04:43.479> dark<00:04:44.479> lashes

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
so pretty peeking out of dark lashes

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.540 
so pretty peeking out of dark lashes
down<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.560> bottom<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:45.979> I'm<00:04:46.190> going<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.370> back<00:04:46.520> up

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.860 
down the bottom so I'm going to back up
just<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.940> little<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.419> we're<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.840> to

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
blush I start back here but for some

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.469 
blush I start back here but for some
reason<00:05:45.919> with<00:05:46.039> this<00:05:46.250> blush<00:05:46.550> I<00:05:46.729> like<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.300> apply

reason with this blush I like to apply

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.580 
reason with this blush I like to apply
it<00:05:47.539> right<00:05:47.930> at<00:05:48.110> the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
it right at the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.440 
it right at the
most<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.830> my<00:05:48.950> cheeks<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.430> blend<00:05:49.639> it<00:05:49.970> backward

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
most of my cheeks and blend it backward

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.120 
most of my cheeks and blend it backward
and<00:05:50.630> I<00:05:50.690> think<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.290> just<00:05:51.410> keeps<00:05:51.680> a<00:05:51.740> little<00:05:51.950> bit

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
and I think it just keeps a little bit

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.430 
and I think it just keeps a little bit
of<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.370> just<00:05:52.820> came<00:05:53.300> in<00:05:53.480> out<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.990> Sun<00:05:54.260> and

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
of that just came in out of the Sun and

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.890 
of that just came in out of the Sun and
look<00:05:54.650> so<00:05:54.950> when<00:05:55.639> you<00:05:55.730> apply<00:05:55.910> it<00:05:56.000> right<00:05:56.270> here

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
look so when you apply it right here

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.830 
look so when you apply it right here
and<00:05:57.669> then<00:05:58.669> just<00:05:58.880> start<00:05:59.120> blending<00:05:59.510> it

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
and then just start blending it

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.290 
and then just start blending it
backwards<00:06:03.040> to<00:06:04.040> finish<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.520> lips<00:06:04.790> I<00:06:04.970> use<00:06:05.150> one
