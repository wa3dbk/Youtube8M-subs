hole<00:01:58.770> which<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.140> shoulder<00:02:01.140> brace

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
hole which is in the shoulder brace

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
hole which is in the shoulder brace
right<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:05.070> listen<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> sound

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
right here and you listen for the sound

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.150 
right here and you listen for the sound
of<00:02:06.090> metal<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> metal<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
of metal the metal and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
of metal the metal and
try<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> write<00:02:09.120> it<00:02:09.240> straight<00:02:09.510> in<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.230> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
try to write it straight in see that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.770 
try to write it straight in see that
went<00:02:10.620> all<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.100> there<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.460> time<00:02:11.780> so

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
went all the way in there that time so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.450 
went all the way in there that time so
if<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.080> neck<00:02:13.350> we're<00:02:13.560> bowed<00:02:13.770> up<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> head

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
if this neck we're bowed up if the head

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.070 
if this neck we're bowed up if the head
stock<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.940> bowed<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
stock was bowed up a little bit you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.570 
stock was bowed up a little bit you
would<00:02:16.230> turn<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> left<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
would turn it to the left to get the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.910 
would turn it to the left to get the
head<00:02:17.730> start<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.300> down<00:02:18.510> slightly<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.710> once

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
head start to go down slightly so once

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
head start to go down slightly so once
you<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> wrench<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.090> can<00:02:21.210> take

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
you get the wrench on there you can take

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.710 
you get the wrench on there you can take
a<00:02:21.480> box<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.050> wrench<00:02:22.820> put<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> lake<00:02:24.300> like

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
a box and wrench put it on the lake like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
a box and wrench put it on the lake like
this<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.290> slightly<00:02:26.100> hold<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:26.550> pressure

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
this and slightly hold a little pressure

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.570 
this and slightly hold a little pressure
so<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.210> doesn't<00:02:27.480> slip<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.800> turn<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
so it doesn't slip and turn it to the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.730 
so it doesn't slip and turn it to the
left<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:30.330> about<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.230> eighth<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.680> a

turn<00:02:31.920> about<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.460> much<00:02:32.670> whatever<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.210> can

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
turn about that much whatever you can

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.830 
turn about that much whatever you can
spend<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> sign<00:02:34.800> hole<00:02:35.010> at<00:02:35.190> one<00:02:35.370> time<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
spend in the sign hole at one time and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.310 
spend in the sign hole at one time and
carefully<00:02:37.320> remove<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> wrench<00:02:38.990> then<00:02:39.990> tighten

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
carefully remove the wrench then tighten

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.210

them into the right to loose them you
don't<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.030> worry<00:02:57.210> about<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.840> side

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
don't have to worry about this side

don't have to worry about this side
spins<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.620> way<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.570> going<00:03:00.570> slower<00:03:01.070> so

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
spins this way that one going slower so

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.740 
spins this way that one going slower so
once<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.550> those<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:03.000> tightened<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.540> tune

built yesterday and he got that it was a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.740 
built yesterday and he got that it was a
ridge<00:03:24.960> with<00:03:25.200> Zarko<00:03:26.300> what's<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.600> each

ridge with Zarko what's going on each
side<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.170> instrument<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> once<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.280> that

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
side and instrument so once we get that

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.690 
side and instrument so once we get that
way<00:03:32.820> we<00:03:33.000> want<00:03:33.210> it<00:03:33.560> we're<00:03:34.560> we're<00:03:35.370> good<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> go

now this is a Martin - a truss rod so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.270 
now this is a Martin - a truss rod so
the<00:03:39.300> way<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.990> direction<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.800> these<00:03:40.980> go

the way that the direction that these go

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.680 
the way that the direction that these go
you<00:03:41.610> turn<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> right<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.660> the
