okay guys here's the problem that I'm
having<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.660> Gy<00:00:12.660> 240<00:00:13.440> gyro<00:00:14.990> currently<00:00:15.990> I'm

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
having with my Gy 240 gyro currently I'm

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.679 
having with my Gy 240 gyro currently I'm
in<00:00:16.230> race<00:00:16.770> mode<00:00:16.800> haven't<00:00:17.670> flown<00:00:17.910> yet<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.480> put

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
in race mode haven't flown yet just put

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.650 
in race mode haven't flown yet just put
a<00:00:18.720> new<00:00:18.869> battery<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.759> it<00:00:20.759> so<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.450> write<00:00:21.630> mode

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a new battery in it so I'm in write mode

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.560 
a new battery in it so I'm in write mode
at<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.079> moment<00:00:22.520> go<00:00:23.520> to<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.790> tail<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.329> tails

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
at the moment go to the tail the tails

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
at the moment go to the tail the tails
set<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:24.989> really<00:00:25.349> nicely<00:00:26.119> it's<00:00:27.119> pretty<00:00:27.360> much

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
set up really nicely it's pretty much

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.999 
set up really nicely it's pretty much
hovering<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.020> its<00:00:28.169> right<00:00:28.470> spot

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
hovering in its right spot

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.100 
hovering in its right spot
no<00:00:29.759> binding<00:00:30.360> in<00:00:30.540> either<00:00:30.869> positions<00:00:32.540> okay<00:00:33.540> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
no binding in either positions okay so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.130 
no binding in either positions okay so
you<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.710> pretty<00:00:35.160> much<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.670> 95%<00:00:36.269> 98%

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
you know pretty much got 95% 98%

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.369 
you know pretty much got 95% 98%
deflection<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.129> each<00:00:38.280> side<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> everything<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
deflection on each side so everything is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.279 
deflection on each side so everything is
great<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.460> click<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.149> mode<00:00:43.250> okay

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
great there now click to right mode okay

djaro light is on okay so that's all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.259 
djaro light is on okay so that's all
good<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:49.679> we<00:00:49.739> test<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:52.670> okay<00:00:54.199> seems<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> hold

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
good now we test here okay seems to hold

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.540 
good now we test here okay seems to hold
yep<00:00:59.929> okay<00:01:00.929> so<00:01:00.989> everything<00:01:01.829> seems<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.280> good

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
they're back to rape mode okay now let's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
they're back to rape mode okay now let's
fly<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.160> I'll<00:01:11.280> show<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.790> happens<00:01:12.060> after

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

I've done about five to ten min five to
eight<00:01:14.310> minutes<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.670> flying<00:01:16.370> okay<00:01:17.370> I've<00:01:18.120> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
gone and flown for about seven minutes

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.210 
gone and flown for about seven minutes
and<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:24.210> rate<00:01:24.510> mode<00:01:24.750> only

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
and in rate mode only

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.720 
and in rate mode only
okay<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.480> light<00:01:27.480> is<00:01:27.630> still<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.950> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.610> can

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
okay so light is still on as you can

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.220 
okay so light is still on as you can
tell<00:01:30.350> moving<00:01:31.350> rudder<00:01:32.150> light<00:01:33.150> tells<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
tell moving rudder light tells you that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.860 
tell moving rudder light tells you that
there's<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.680> information<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.580> it<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
there's some information going to it now

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.850 
there's some information going to it now
my<00:01:37.620> problem<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.300> right<00:01:39.300> here<00:01:39.660> now<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.620> can<00:01:40.740> see

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
my problem is right here now you can see

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
my problem is right here now you can see
where<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> tail<00:01:41.700> pitches<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> rate<00:01:43.080> mode<00:01:43.380> now

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
where the tail pitches in rate mode now

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.250 
where the tail pitches in rate mode now
if<00:01:44.160> I<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.730> pulled<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> perch<00:01:45.660> from<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.020> way

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
if I go pulled the perch from one way

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.040 
if I go pulled the perch from one way
let's<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.130> slowly<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
let's go slowly you can see that it

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.180 
let's go slowly you can see that it
creeps<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:50.210> go<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> opposite<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
creeps back go the opposite way and I

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.110 
creeps back go the opposite way and I
literally<00:01:53.550> got<00:01:53.820> no<00:01:55.580> deflection<00:01:56.580> at<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:56.970> it

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
literally got no deflection at all it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.100 
literally got no deflection at all it
just<00:01:57.150> pulls<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.050> one<00:01:58.380> side<00:01:58.850> now

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
just pulls all the way to one side now

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.270 
just pulls all the way to one side now
zoom<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.410> bit<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> can

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
zoom in a little bit more so you can

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
zoom in a little bit more so you can
probably<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.060> better<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.230> full

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
probably see a bit better but so full

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
probably see a bit better but so full
deflection<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.160> one<00:02:05.340> way<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.600> sorry<00:02:07.380> not

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
deflection in one way in right sorry not

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
deflection in one way in right sorry not
right<00:02:07.710> Modi<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.129> heading<00:02:08.429> hold<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> should

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
right Modi and heading hold my I should

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.980 
right Modi and heading hold my I should
say<00:02:09.349> let<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.700> slowly<00:02:12.180> creeps<00:02:12.660> back

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
say let go and it slowly creeps back

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.950 
say let go and it slowly creeps back
instead<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.560> sitting<00:02:13.980> where<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.880> left<00:02:15.120> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
instead of sitting where I left it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.080 
instead of sitting where I left it
switch<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.500> into<00:02:16.850> rate<00:02:17.850> mode<00:02:19.250> okay<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.580> back

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
switch it into rate mode okay so back

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.590 
switch it into rate mode okay so back
into<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> middle<00:02:21.780> nice

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.350 

djaro<00:02:25.170> light<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.770> off<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:27.330> mode

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
djaro light is off so it's in right mode

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.070 
djaro light is off so it's in right mode
now<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.850> go<00:02:31.280> everything<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.660> spot-on<00:02:33.660> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
now and if I go everything is spot-on in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.250 
now and if I go everything is spot-on in
right<00:02:34.290> mode<00:02:35.210> okay

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
right mode okay

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.200 
right mode okay
flick<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.740> back<00:02:38.010> into<00:02:38.220> heading<00:02:39.120> hold<00:02:39.360> mode<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
flick it back into heading hold mode and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.020 
flick it back into heading hold mode and
we<00:02:42.210> start<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.690> bursts<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.670> drifting

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
we start to get bursts the drifting

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.560 
we start to get bursts the drifting
again

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
again

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.110 
again
now<00:02:46.320> I've<00:02:46.560> already<00:02:46.830> adjusted<00:02:47.190> my<00:02:47.520> gains<00:02:47.850> and
