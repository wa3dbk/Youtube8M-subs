00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
commend the two that actually did I know

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.710 
commend the two that actually did I know
that<00:00:47.800> trying<00:00:48.370> out<00:00:48.489> new<00:00:48.519> things<00:00:48.640> can<00:00:49.149> be<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.390> bit

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
that trying out new things can be a bit

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.270 
that trying out new things can be a bit
difficult<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.350> putting<00:00:50.890> forth<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.220> effort

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
difficult and putting forth that effort

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.599 
difficult and putting forth that effort
can<00:00:51.760> always<00:00:52.269> always<00:00:52.839> bring<00:00:53.679> forth<00:00:53.949> new<00:00:54.070> skills

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
can always always bring forth new skills

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.799 
can always always bring forth new skills
and<00:00:54.940> stuff<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.800> that's<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.100> good<00:00:57.250> thing

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and stuff and that's a good thing

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.970 
and stuff and that's a good thing
because<00:00:58.809> clients<00:00:59.469> are<00:00:59.559> always<00:00:59.679> going<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.920> be

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
because clients are always going to be

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.709 
because clients are always going to be
asking<00:01:00.399> for<00:01:00.460> different<00:01:00.640> things<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.690> you
