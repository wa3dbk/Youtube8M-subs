the<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.830> used<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.340> my<00:02:27.370> my<00:02:27.970> chart<00:02:28.300> rope<00:02:28.480> video

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the one I used in my my chart rope video

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170 
the one I used in my my chart rope video
and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.950> still<00:02:30.190> got<00:02:30.310> my<00:02:30.340> char<00:02:30.670> rope<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.030> there

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
and I still got my char rope in there

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
and I still got my char rope in there
and<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.330> figured<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:31.810> carry<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.290> inside<00:02:32.440> there

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and I figured out carry it inside there

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000 
and I figured out carry it inside there
put<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.980> put<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> stand<00:02:37.290> back<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.709> holds

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
put the put the stand back on and holds

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
put the put the stand back on and holds
it<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.190> place<00:02:39.220> real<00:02:40.000> nice<00:02:40.209> life<00:02:40.510> usually<00:02:41.049> I'll

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it in place real nice life usually I'll

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.440 
it in place real nice life usually I'll
put<00:02:41.410> stuff<00:02:41.680> between<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.060> kind<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.299> keep

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
put stuff between here just kind of keep

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.440 
put stuff between here just kind of keep
quiet<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.920> pretty<00:02:45.190> interesting<00:02:45.459> stove<00:02:45.940> I've

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
quiet it's pretty interesting stove I've

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.979 
quiet it's pretty interesting stove I've
used<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> lot<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:49.510> come<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:49.840> handy

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
used it a lot and it's come in handy

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.110 
used it a lot and it's come in handy
quite<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> bit<00:02:50.799> especially<00:02:51.340> during<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.940> fire

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
quite a bit especially during the fire

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.009 
quite a bit especially during the fire
seasons<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.910> kind<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.239> show<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.480> how

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
seasons and it just kind of show you how

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.630 
seasons and it just kind of show you how
it<00:02:56.170> goes<00:02:56.200> together<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.100> I'll<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.459> close

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
it goes together and I'll get it close

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.590 
it goes together and I'll get it close
up<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:58.390> just<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> second<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
up of it here in just a second the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.340 
up of it here in just a second the
stainless<00:03:02.019> steel<00:03:02.080> wire<00:03:02.560> or<00:03:02.860> antenna<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
stainless steel wire or antenna that I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.699 
stainless steel wire or antenna that I
used<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.120> slide<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:07.720> from<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> four

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
used it just slide then from the four

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.759 
used it just slide then from the four
holes<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.190> drilled<00:03:09.600> my<00:03:10.600> gsi<00:03:11.109> cup<00:03:11.410> sits

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
holes that I drilled my gsi cup sits

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.780 
holes that I drilled my gsi cup sits
right<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.100> top<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.959> way<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.350> works<00:03:14.790> I'm

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
right on top and the way this works I'm

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.580 
right on top and the way this works I'm
actually<00:03:16.120> going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.570> fire<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.019> thing<00:03:17.079> up<00:03:17.380> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
actually going to fire this thing up and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.190 
actually going to fire this thing up and
I'll<00:03:17.709> show<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.359> exactly<00:03:19.359> how<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.780> works<00:03:19.989> for

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
I'll show you exactly how it works for

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.810 
I'll show you exactly how it works for
me<00:03:20.320> I'll<00:03:20.440> boil<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.859> cup<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.040> water<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.609> see<00:03:21.790> i

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
me I'll boil a cup of water now see i

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.370 
me I'll boil a cup of water now see i
have<00:03:21.940> used<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.600> with<00:03:22.810> denatured<00:03:23.260> alcohol

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
have used this with denatured alcohol

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380 
have used this with denatured alcohol
before<00:03:23.890> too<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.489> works<00:03:24.670> pretty<00:03:24.850> well<00:03:25.000> but

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
before too and it works pretty well but

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.110 
before too and it works pretty well but
the<00:03:26.290> only<00:03:26.410> drawback<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.950> using<00:03:27.100> esbit<00:03:27.760> fuel<00:03:28.000> is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the only drawback to using esbit fuel is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.370 
the only drawback to using esbit fuel is
a<00:03:28.150> lot<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.230> have<00:03:29.350> a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
a lot of you know you have to have a

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.680 
a lot of you know you have to have a
lighter<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:29.769> an<00:03:30.010> open<00:03:30.250> flame<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.880> get<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
lighter or an open flame to get it to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.940 
lighter or an open flame to get it to
ignite<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:34.959> really<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> big<00:03:35.470> issue<00:03:35.530> if

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
ignite it's not really a big issue if

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.430 
ignite it's not really a big issue if
you've<00:03:36.070> got<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.400> right<00:03:36.519> stuff<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.880> do<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.440> what

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you've got the right stuff to do it what

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.170 
you've got the right stuff to do it what
you<00:03:38.560> find<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.859> here<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.250> doing<00:03:39.549> videos<00:03:39.910> then

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
you find out here just doing videos then

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.910 
you find out here just doing videos then
the<00:03:40.269> eye<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.630> actually<00:03:41.019> have<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.739> stuff

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
the eye I actually have the right stuff

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.890 
the eye I actually have the right stuff
to<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> all<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.420> do<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.690> boil

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
to do it all I'm going to do is boil

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.349 
to do it all I'm going to do is boil
about<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> half<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.620> cup<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.859> this<00:03:45.130> just<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.239> get

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
about a half a cup of this just to get

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.559 
about a half a cup of this just to get
it<00:03:46.510> done<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.930> then<00:03:47.290> as<00:03:47.440> it's<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:48.269> I'll<00:03:49.269> show

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.330 
it done and then as it's going I'll show
you<00:03:49.660> how<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.959> little<00:03:50.170> gas<00:03:50.500> jets<00:03:50.859> on<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.130> side

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
you how the little gas jets on the side

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.210 
you how the little gas jets on the side
actually<00:03:51.819> work

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.530 

it's<00:03:58.220> actually<00:03:58.370> starting<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.970> pretty<00:03:59.180> hot<00:03:59.330> you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it's actually starting it pretty hot you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.800 
it's actually starting it pretty hot you
see<00:03:59.720> it's<00:03:59.840> starting<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.200> boil<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.710> a<00:04:01.810> couple

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
see it's starting to boil and a couple

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.030 
see it's starting to boil and a couple
minutes<00:04:02.960> ago<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.320> went<00:04:03.500> ahead<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.740> I<00:04:03.830> threw

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
minutes ago I went ahead and I threw

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.970 
minutes ago I went ahead and I threw
another<00:04:04.310> another<00:04:05.320> Nesbitt<00:04:06.320> fuel<00:04:06.530> tab<00:04:06.740> in

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
another another Nesbitt fuel tab in

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.110 
another another Nesbitt fuel tab in
there<00:04:07.130> because<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.340> lot<00:04:07.520> of<00:04:07.550> times<00:04:07.790> I'll<00:04:07.940> use

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
there because a lot of times I'll use

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.720 
there because a lot of times I'll use
two<00:04:08.390> in<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:08.690> thing<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:10.280> because<00:04:10.370> when<00:04:10.610> I'm

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
two in this thing just because when I'm

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.410 
two in this thing just because when I'm
cooking<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.330> can<00:04:11.480> see<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.780> burner<00:04:12.020> effect

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
cooking you can see the burner effect

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.750 
cooking you can see the burner effect
from<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.480> vent<00:04:14.780> holes<00:04:15.100> actually<00:04:16.100> working

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
from the vent holes actually working

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.400 
from the vent holes actually working
this<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.299> pretty<00:04:17.510> efficient<00:04:17.989> fuel<00:04:18.200> in

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
this this is a pretty efficient fuel in

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.550 
this this is a pretty efficient fuel in
my<00:04:18.590> eyes<00:04:22.360> now<00:04:23.360> I've<00:04:23.480> used<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.900> with<00:04:24.020> just<00:04:24.230> one

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
my eyes now I've used it with just one

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.800 
my eyes now I've used it with just one
as<00:04:24.830> bit<00:04:25.040> tab<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.520> works<00:04:25.700> just<00:04:25.820> fine<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
as bit tab and it works just fine the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.300 
as bit tab and it works just fine the
only<00:04:26.990> reason<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.350> went<00:04:27.500> ahead<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.770> added<00:04:27.950> two

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
only reason I went ahead and added two

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.090 
only reason I went ahead and added two
was<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.550> speed<00:04:28.880> up<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.060> gasification<00:04:29.630> effect

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.890 

now<00:04:34.100> I've<00:04:34.160> even<00:04:34.430> used<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.880> stove<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.450> purify

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
now I've even used this stove to purify

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.560 
now I've even used this stove to purify
water<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:39.740> bottle<00:04:39.950> I've<00:04:40.790> actually<00:04:41.030> got<00:04:41.390> this

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
water in a bottle I've actually got this

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.170 
water in a bottle I've actually got this
one<00:04:41.780> cleaned<00:04:42.080> up<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:43.610> there's<00:04:43.910> still<00:04:44.030> a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
one cleaned up but there's still a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.220 
one cleaned up but there's still a
little<00:04:44.240> bit<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.600> tinge<00:04:44.900> where<00:04:45.140> I've

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
little bit of a tinge where I've

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.950 
little bit of a tinge where I've
actually<00:04:45.440> put<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:45.920> onto<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.220> stove<00:04:46.520> and

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
actually put it onto the stove and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.420 
actually put it onto the stove and
boiled<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> water<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.470> purify<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.920> inside<00:04:49.430> a

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
boiled the water to purify it inside a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.360 
boiled the water to purify it inside a
lot<00:04:52.430> of<00:04:52.580> times<00:04:52.790> when<00:04:52.970> i<00:04:53.000> use<00:04:53.270> my<00:04:53.510> equipment<00:04:54.050> I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
lot of times when i use my equipment I

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.480 
lot of times when i use my equipment I
don't<00:04:55.370> get<00:04:55.580> into<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> big<00:04:56.030> hurry<00:04:56.270> not<00:04:56.960> anymore

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
don't get into a big hurry not anymore

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.900 
don't get into a big hurry not anymore
not<00:04:58.490> after<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:59.920> it's<00:05:00.920> kind<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.250> taught<00:05:01.640> me<00:05:01.820> to

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
not after that it's kind of taught me to

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.590 
not after that it's kind of taught me to
slow<00:05:02.180> down<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.390> little<00:05:02.660> bit

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.000 

I<00:05:08.780> would<00:05:09.780> hate<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.080> see<00:05:10.260> what<00:05:10.290> happened<00:05:10.830> if<00:05:10.920> I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
I would hate to see what happened if I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.100 
I would hate to see what happened if I
got<00:05:11.220> into<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.490> hurry<00:05:11.760> with<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.000> stove<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.660> don't

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
got into a hurry with a stove I don't

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.440 
got into a hurry with a stove I don't
think<00:05:13.170> I'd<00:05:13.440> need<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.680> third<00:05:13.950> degree<00:05:14.070> burn<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:15.330> go

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
think I'd need a third degree burn to go

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.270 
think I'd need a third degree burn to go
along<00:05:15.690> with<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.870> cut<00:05:16.140> finger<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.740> also<00:05:20.070> when<00:05:20.250> I

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
along with a cut finger and also when I

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.130 
along with a cut finger and also when I
use<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.790> during<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.210> fire<00:05:21.450> ban<00:05:21.720> I'll<00:05:21.930> actually

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
use this during a fire ban I'll actually

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.990 
use this during a fire ban I'll actually
clear<00:05:22.650> away<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:23.250> good<00:05:24.150> foot<00:05:25.160> around<00:05:26.160> my<00:05:26.640> stove

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
clear away a good foot around my stove

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.510 
clear away a good foot around my stove
as<00:05:27.660> you<00:05:27.780> can<00:05:27.870> see<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.200> does<00:05:28.410> come<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.830> this<00:05:29.370> is

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
as you can see it does come out this is

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.980 
as you can see it does come out this is
all<00:05:29.610> pretty<00:05:29.790> much<00:05:29.940> green<00:05:30.390> grass<00:05:30.660> we're

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
all pretty much green grass we're

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.600 
all pretty much green grass we're
actually<00:05:31.170> allowed<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.770> have<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.950> fire<00:05:32.340> right

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
actually allowed to have a fire right

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.540 
actually allowed to have a fire right
now<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:33.120> it's<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:33.480> really<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.900> big<00:05:33.990> deal<00:05:34.550> I've

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
now so it's not really a big deal I've

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.080 
now so it's not really a big deal I've
got<00:05:35.790> it<00:05:35.940> all<00:05:36.030> under<00:05:36.090> control<00:05:40.790> and<00:05:41.790> we've<00:05:41.940> got<00:05:42.060> a

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
got it all under control and we've got a

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.960 
got it all under control and we've got a
pretty<00:05:42.270> good<00:05:42.480> rolling<00:05:42.750> boil<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:44.550> as<00:05:44.670> far<00:05:44.910> as

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
pretty good rolling boil and as far as

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.090 
pretty good rolling boil and as far as
the<00:05:45.180> esbit<00:05:45.600> fuel<00:05:45.840> tabs<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.350> usually<00:05:46.740> carry<00:05:46.950> a
