00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.390
 all together I could squeal Werner Schlager for his helpers 14 0 victory 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.269
 Arrest dark against Lienz for interview 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.289
 and 10 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.199
 we have 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.199
 Werner Terhorst played incredibly well 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.589
 what is the secret of success 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.050
 Aryan was not tough 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 that many at the player over paper make human mistakes and me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.100
 just say 'okay I'll use it if Agnes Maier the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.569
 Andreas Biermann 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.580
 my best and so far is very good 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.780
 So journeyman King Timo Heinze Münster can very well taken over 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.890
 and even if the self-doubt and Bernd Wenske us a very very good 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.780
 Game is not the problem that is the problem if you just stop the call 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 starts is not so much spin, the opponent can draw better against 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.830
 I think it's percent 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
 and the primary problem is if you have a few players 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.610
 Check behind and the stands so heard you go away the harder it is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.270
 quiet 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 Damn I feel the first apartment can also balls for the cases 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 Captain Kerstin the technique is not yet hundred percent 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 but if she is very sorry but we can serve better 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.030
 I mean the writers in the live blog who wanted to know what you think of the mental 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380
 So far you should mentally so he set very strong mental 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.150
 Area 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.980
 "Thank you 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.350
 I had the opportunity to play in Beijing before playing with a Mittal Group 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 Working together for the first time in 35 years has been torn up 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.010
 and the fact that I have very very well so percent to one 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.010
 Actually, I'm a Christian 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.149
 it can be free game and that is very very big and present in the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.010
 second season was a sequel 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.460
 and around 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.220
 and that will definitely be the future the mental component looks different 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 becomes more important and important in table tennis 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 At most the two women on the first of January was the first time that was me 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.740
 say that expressly say Dhaka dpa 11 falls the parking 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.900
 Champion winners count among others with van Morrison always saying that they 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.060
 the break your head if I do not have the knee 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 why is way 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.700
 Start question with barcode after that but that was earlier than then I got it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 Webber has started »said English but it does not seem to be about this anymore 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.469
 Phantom pain that there what i do not do it once 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.989
 so around 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.480
 Halberstadt okay that can line everyone the plantation blood had pain though 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.479
 they almost hoisted nets 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:27.369
 while he saves a lot of strength exercises the 8% for Malik is here and there times 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.309
 then way and then it went 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.339
 and that was 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.969
 Now I noticed that many of the Schwarzenberg of Spielmannszügen 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.299
 most of the time fast man what played just a tradition that 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.519
 Gaming tables Mime Black happy I've noticed now that percent 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.290
 Lying by men when I'm dying Opel again it's fast 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.269
 Maybe yes, again with studs offer next percent have Tino 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.979
 Berbig week prohibited 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.799
 or what Mesa 13% from his process his black is not better 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.999
 that is, percent will be bigger that we are a little bit more 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.269
 too many spiders 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.590
 Hackers Akbaba LP I only believe what Hadamar or forehand played 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.289
 in the doubles had to have finals 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.109
 then it was quiet in a longer planned jersey 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.659
 since I was not no that was just an alco test that said 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.849
 her boss is the Tate Gallery not just with a good Dribbling Center Court 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.879
 but persist and then has one percent 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.370
 A subtle of Magna permeates has ever played with the natural park 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.779
 One fool four or five years ago 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.649
 under 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.970
 There was one not bad writing to say that 's why I wanted with him Dr 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.910
 With the Herforderinnen I drank you into it 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.019
 York likes 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.260
 no hope at last for the painter it turned out that the double 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.639
 works pretty well 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.400
 and the lances thugs are for us often are playing for us often unfortunately 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.579
 really really good 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.040
 on the Maas arithmetically from the final against Simon Christian are the plants 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.469
 favors 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.729
 but his also wobbled in the quarter-final one in the knockout stages 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.249
 the Walking the Walking Dead you can see the many around 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.459
 but that has less of us it's just that the density comes back 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.549
 bit folded is just because of the two rackets 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.709
 and in jumping that while we can change that out of something we can get loose 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.789
 play we have reported 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.789
 because after a short time - on 5 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.029
 so i wish them I wish them so 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.559
 I played games nee Seng I did not like to play strange game 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:29.759
 with extreme 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.169
 many autopsy has very very good service was the Zion 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.559
 to measure through 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.759
 Lately a bit heavier than against Timo that is it 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.449
 You do not do anything when the coach decides the game for you 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.749
 said interested 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.229
 yes yes, yes, yes 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.940
 that's a goal you've earned with 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.590
 I find myself neck 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.090
 and around 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.559
 it's important, but it could be a lot harder 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.750
 a sign of too much success for tomorrow's day and series 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.350
 in heavy traffic
