00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.990
 very happy to have won a 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.120
 classic the way it was played 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.160
 of the football intensity that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.220
 he kept the team for 90 less 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.820
 very happy for the truth that it was a 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.279
 way to say goodbye here of local power 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.730
 win the classic with our people 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.519
 and the truth that thank you for everything 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.300
 that he has given to me I read and in turn that he 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.559
 go very well yes I think that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.410
 the basis of success is in humility 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.230
 of work on the group theme that the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.199
 group has for the same side all to 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.519
 Although that case is much more 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.680
 valuable players who do not play 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.180
 that are playing because you 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.460
 those who want to be outside 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.010
 inside the field that have box and 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.290
 however , day by day 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.489
 They want to keep progressing and that's what they want 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.100
 say they look at the players that 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.989
 they are inside the court that day to 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 day they also want to keep playing me 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.780
 I think he has good material to do 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 any scheme 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.150
 I think the years went by 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.670
 he was implemented and he can achieve what 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.700
 What else do you like the team 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.060
 can 40 40 meters then I think of 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.980
 a little bit I'm coupling knowing has 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 now you have a one for the 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.390
 current work blue 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.240
 the meeting group is focused on what 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.710
 wants means a little more things and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
 He is a technician who has been watching us 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.360
 knows the virtues and the shortcomings of each 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.670
 one of ours then is just that is very 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.060
 good and very positive very much I think 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.790
 what 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.570
 the capo the general or who does not have another 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 stadium the pressure on the playing field 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 the people are not there next to us 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.110
 then what the field generates 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.750
 in which nowhere and for us 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.600
 It would be very good to be able to play again 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.390
 there we have lost points out there in case 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.819
 with catholic already 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.170
 thank God and yesterday was a court 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.140
 complicated and we could get the three 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.790
 points but we in the field I think 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.390
 that the teacher has been a pillar 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.820
 fundamental has drawn from each one what 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 better day after day despite the triumphs 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.290
 sometimes any player can 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.260
 shrink a little the individual and without 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.000
 However the referring players never 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.090
 depleted have always wanted to continue 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.590
 progressing and that based on what the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530
 professor figueroa has given us day to day 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.110
 has not proposed the new teacher not what 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.300
 we know but I think that all 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.400
 teachers have virtues for something that 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.010
 is with de felipe who is a technician who 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.890
 has directed a lot in Argentina then 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.820
 we will have to be with a lot 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.630
 predisposition 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.380
 it's about simplifying things and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 try to be able 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.450
 help him as soon as possible so that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.310
 suits the campus so we the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.460
 group is a group that I'm not going to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.280
 talk is noticeable even though in all 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.750
 the groups there are differences of groups 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.320
 they are very well has always been good and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.700
 in difficult times when they have 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.530
 tornado difficult moments has sat 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.240
 to talk and he has clarified and you have always 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 progressed it is very difficult we have 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.430
 seen the threshing that has never won 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.430
 About the hour 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.140
 and that is that we have to have our 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.750
 sin and know that we have to go to 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.580
 continue to implement on a free court 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.580
 to also enjoy our
