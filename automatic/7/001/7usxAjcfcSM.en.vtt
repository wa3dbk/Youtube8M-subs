00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.830
 shit grain mills are being introduced new 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.850
 technology manufacturer promises that 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.530
 European equipment will not allow 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.749
 only save but also improve the quality 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.519
 traditionally Russian bread 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.509
 now piping to store shelves 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.160
 will come 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.449
 sterile bread which is not long 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.740
 stakes archeady acero reproach anyone 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.929
 60 tons of bread per day 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.640
 the performance of the new shop at the same time 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.769
 in each of the four shifts only works 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.449
 just 15 people and bakers in 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.550
 the usual understanding of the word their 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.320
 difficult to call the operators 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.320
 fully computerized line 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.460
 us automated 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 that is, if you need to push 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.790
 you are on the Web-site 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.860
 so equipped only the most advanced 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.410
 bakeries of europe in russia nothing like 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.030
 no longer started just the bread factory 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.680
 purchased equipment on credit and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.140
 expect to buy it in five years 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.059
 bread business is not the most profitable in it 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 too high competition raises 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.460
 prices are dangerous itself already a good name is more expensive 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.949
 benefits based on recent events 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.870
 which are on the market 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.920
 and here it came from 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.640
 and years and this 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.270
 we will not find a caterpillar 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.520
 we 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.990
 have imposed as we call 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.750
 moratorium on 2 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 social bread shore left this loaf 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.409
 spring and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.579
 lion up Russian on these two world bread and 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.039
 soon 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.680
 they me and all in this workshop will be 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.020
 produced more than 20 varieties of bread this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.909
 called the extra whole cycle of kneading 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 the dough till the ruddy loaves takes about 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.229
 3 hours it would seem that he is ready 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 product but no more 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.280
 important steps determining how much 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 appetizing this product will be on the counters 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210
 bread comes out of a hot oven 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.159
 sterile and ideally exactly so he 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 should reach the buyer so 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.579
 called fair room in which 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.069
 fresh bread spends about an hour between 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.899
 oven and packaging line this conveyor 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.909
 constantly is about 300 thousand 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.399
 loaves that cool down here with 100 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.399
 degrees to 35 only after this bread 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.599
 can be cut easily and without crumbs 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.120
 one of the main secrets of production 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.440
 the correct packaging keeps the bread 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.989
 only a special film without perforation 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.150
 modern materials that allow 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.050
 he can breathe but is not allowed to grow stale 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.030
 film 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.210
 is a barrier between the circling environment 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 and the product itself which is 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.630
 inside 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.110
 This is a special film with 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.090
 polypropylene based 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.410
 designed to bacterium 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.290
 upload and traces did not fall inside 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.300
 package and products was harmless to 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.370
 consumer packaged bread 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.080
 stays fresh for four days but on 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.360
 the plant believes that this is not the limit 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.640
 shelf life can be increased if 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.140
 pump inert gas under the film and this 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 technology is going here too 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.200
 introduce Arkady Tsirulnikov Sergey 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.740
