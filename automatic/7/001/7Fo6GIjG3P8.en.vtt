00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.150
 White beach is located in the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.800
 municipality of yaiza south of lanzarote and 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.510
 in recent years it has consolidated 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.810
 as the third tourist enclave of the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.810
 island 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.290
 in this unique enclave the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.110
 fourteenth cruise to swim the mouth 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.449
 with a distance of 15 kilometers between 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.790
 white beach in lanzarote and corralejo in 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.070
 fuerteventura this year the truth that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.239
 also the numbers the acceptance of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.360
 participants was that we thought 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:54.250
 specifically 96 of which of the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.690
 slowest category 14 the average 41 and 36 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 of the fastest 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.720
 it was not a test 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489
 strictly competitive so the 91 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.140
 registered swimmers left the beach 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.420
 white in three groups with an interval 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.090
 5 minutes in the slow mode 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 14 swimmers participated in the average 41 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.260
 and in the fast 36 the organization to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 charge of the Vulcano triathlon club and the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
 The municipality of Yaiza recommended the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 athletes stay grouped up 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.800
 the last refreshment point 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.900
 moment in which they were totally 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.530
 free to print the best rhythm 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530
 possible 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.720
 with the first rays of sun with the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.880
 sava the test the group the entrees or 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.560
 the crossing at 8 o'clock swimmers 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.390
 half did it five minutes later 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.430
 and fast they got into the water 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.310
 8 and 11 hours 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.320
 of this meat of the event in this way 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.270
 how swimmers are trained by three 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.250
 groups of different colors where 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.260
 each group has a different level of 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 swimming and some measures are adopted 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.350
 logistics with support vessels and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.270
 canoe up what it is to get to the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 beach is always trying to control the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.570
 group with some rhythms that mark the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.080
 participant who puts in his moment 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.070
 description and the truth that that gives us 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.070
 security guarantee 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.099
 all right 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.969
 the sea this year the time 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.980
 the decision of now has been good 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:08.099
 starting from the mouth and nothing is that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.329
 a little bit more tidy but good 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.999
 for others really wants the sea 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.999
 enough to be quite after 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.560
 this is a very very complicated test of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.600
 carry out because of the organization 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.930
 what you have to have and coordination with 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.430
 canoe with boats security and many 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.840
 effects that you can not control until 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.430
 day of the test and happens to do 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.360
 then we can be pretty 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.360
 happy with the result 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.350
 the test started with a clear favorite 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.510
 to achieve victory and that favorite 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 did not disappoint guillermo verdejo returned to 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.020
 be at the top of the podium 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 Basque swimmer once again proved his 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.130
 physical and technical power reaching its 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.440
 fourth victory with a time of 4 hours 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.419
 45 minutes and 20 seconds 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160
 this year the sea condition has not been 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.090
 like last year when he could do the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.910
 record in 339 this year we've already gone 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.860
 to almost 104 hours long by the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.690
 theme of the currents and the sea that 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.000
 production to the area where they come together 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.960
 two islands is a lot of current this area 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.970
 that embodies of a lot of wind 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.370
 then it's not easy not to cross 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.510
 hard and very beautiful not because of the fact 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.510
 join two islands 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.630
