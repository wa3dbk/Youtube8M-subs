00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.950 

I'm<00:00:16.520> a<00:00:16.610> big<00:00:16.880> proponent<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.510> hand-cut

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
I'm a big proponent of hand-cut

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.990 
I'm a big proponent of hand-cut
dovetails<00:00:18.130> so<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:19.160> think<00:00:19.430> it's<00:00:19.550> a<00:00:19.640> way<00:00:19.760> for<00:00:19.789> us

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
dovetails so I think it's a way for us

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.269 
dovetails so I think it's a way for us
woodworkers<00:00:20.599> to<00:00:20.750> show<00:00:20.900> off<00:00:21.080> our<00:00:21.230> talents<00:00:21.710> now

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
woodworkers to show off our talents now

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.890 
woodworkers to show off our talents now
there's<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.640> couple<00:00:23.029> areas<00:00:23.210> that<00:00:23.570> really<00:00:23.869> I

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
there's a couple areas that really I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.210 
there's a couple areas that really I
look<00:00:24.200> for<00:00:24.410> when<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:24.590> look<00:00:24.770> at<00:00:24.890> somebody's

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
look for when I look at somebody's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.859 
look for when I look at somebody's
dovetails<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:25.849> make<00:00:26.029> sure<00:00:26.210> or<00:00:26.360> to<00:00:26.450> see<00:00:26.750> if

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
dovetails to make sure or to see if

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.870 
dovetails to make sure or to see if
they're<00:00:27.079> hand<00:00:27.289> cut<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.740> that<00:00:28.250> area<00:00:28.579> is<00:00:28.669> the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
they're hand cut and that area is the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.519 
they're hand cut and that area is the
pin<00:00:29.090> area<00:00:29.390> that's<00:00:29.840> what<00:00:29.960> we're<00:00:30.079> talking<00:00:30.349> about

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
pin area that's what we're talking about

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.679 
pin area that's what we're talking about
right<00:00:30.740> here<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.519> pin<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:32.480> is<00:00:32.660> a

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
right here this is the pin and this is a

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.869 
right here this is the pin and this is a
specific<00:00:33.320> area<00:00:33.470> we're<00:00:33.769> talking<00:00:34.160> about<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
specific area we're talking about the

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.700 
specific area we're talking about the
front<00:00:35.180> edge<00:00:35.330> of<00:00:35.449> that<00:00:35.600> pin<00:00:35.870> there's<00:00:36.440> no

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
front edge of that pin there's no

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.250 
front edge of that pin there's no
available<00:00:37.250> jigs<00:00:38.089> on<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.390> market<00:00:38.780> today<00:00:38.930> that

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
available jigs on the market today that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.350 
available jigs on the market today that
can<00:00:39.739> cut<00:00:40.040> that<00:00:40.220> at<00:00:40.400> less<00:00:40.610> than<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.850> quarter<00:00:41.210> inch

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
can cut that at less than a quarter inch

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.689 
can cut that at less than a quarter inch
in<00:00:41.510> width<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.960> that's<00:00:42.410> because<00:00:42.920> they're<00:00:43.550> all

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
in width and that's because they're all

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.310 
in width and that's because they're all
done<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.089> router<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.629> all<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.900> routers

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
done with a router and all the routers

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.830 
done with a router and all the routers
have<00:00:45.589> quarter<00:00:46.190> inch<00:00:46.370> bit<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.360> shank<00:00:47.660> on

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
have quarter inch bit is the shank on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200 
have quarter inch bit is the shank on
the<00:00:47.960> bit<00:00:48.289> that's<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.680> smallest<00:00:49.070> diameter<00:00:49.280> so

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
the bit that's the smallest diameter so

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.569 
the bit that's the smallest diameter so
that<00:00:50.809> has<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.289> be<00:00:51.410> at<00:00:51.500> least<00:00:51.530> quarter<00:00:52.250> inch<00:00:52.430> in

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
that has to be at least quarter inch in

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.250 
that has to be at least quarter inch in
order<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.090> bit<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.300> travel<00:00:53.930> through<00:00:54.079> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
order for the bit to travel through the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.950 
order for the bit to travel through the
slot<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:55.489> need<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.879> get<00:00:56.030> below<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:56.390> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
slot so we need to get below that and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.470 
slot so we need to get below that and
until<00:00:57.440> now<00:00:57.920> I've<00:00:58.399> only<00:00:58.579> known<00:00:58.879> how<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.090> do<00:00:59.300> that

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
until now I've only known how to do that

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.510 
until now I've only known how to do that
with<00:00:59.660> hand<00:01:00.109> cutting<00:01:00.410> them<00:01:00.710> by<00:01:00.890> setting<00:01:01.219> up<00:01:01.309> and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
with hand cutting them by setting up and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.279 
with hand cutting them by setting up and
using<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.120> Saul's<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:02.660> hand<00:01:02.840> cutting<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
using the Saul's and hand cutting the

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.620 
using the Saul's and hand cutting the
pieces<00:01:03.500> all<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.770> way<00:01:03.890> through<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:04.970> I've<00:01:05.390> came

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
pieces all the way through but I've came

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.910 
pieces all the way through but I've came
up<00:01:05.750> with<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.960> jig<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.259> I'm<00:01:06.470> going<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.680> show<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
up with a jig that I'm going to show you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.550 
up with a jig that I'm going to show you
today<00:01:07.160> that<00:01:07.880> actually<00:01:08.630> does<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:09.350> us<00:01:09.470> and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
today that actually does this for us and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560 
today that actually does this for us and
it<00:01:09.950> really<00:01:10.250> works<00:01:10.520> slick<00:01:10.910> so<00:01:11.119> let's<00:01:11.330> take<00:01:11.539> a

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
it really works slick so let's take a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.210 
it really works slick so let's take a
look<00:01:11.780> now<00:01:11.810> we've<00:01:12.080> done<00:01:12.289> our<00:01:12.350> layout<00:01:12.830> we're

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
look now we've done our layout we're

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.680 
look now we've done our layout we're
gonna<00:01:13.310> go<00:01:13.520> over<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.940> router<00:01:14.090> table<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
gonna go over to the router table and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.990 
gonna go over to the router table and
I'll<00:01:14.750> show<00:01:14.899> you<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.140> jig<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
I'll show you the jig so this is the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.310 
I'll show you the jig so this is the
router<00:01:17.210> jig<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.660> I<00:01:17.750> was<00:01:17.869> telling<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.259> about

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
router jig that I was telling you about

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.649 
router jig that I was telling you about
it's<00:01:19.040> all<00:01:19.220> made<00:01:19.430> with<00:01:19.610> plywood<00:01:20.000> material

this is an oak strip that runs in the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.410 
this is an oak strip that runs in the
track<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.250> miter<00:01:25.549> gauge<00:01:25.640> would<00:01:26.000> run<00:01:26.240> in

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
track that the miter gauge would run in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.880 
track that the miter gauge would run in
and<00:01:26.630> what<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.290> see<00:01:27.500> here<00:01:27.530> are<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.830> couple

and what you see here are a couple

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.580 
and what you see here are a couple
different<00:01:28.430> fences<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.689> fence<00:01:30.170> are

different fences this is a fence are

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.499 
different fences this is a fence are
both<00:01:30.829> set<00:01:31.070> up<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.340> 12<00:01:31.610> degree<00:01:31.909> angles<00:01:32.329> that's

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
both set up on 12 degree angles that's

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.789 
both set up on 12 degree angles that's
the<00:01:32.630> angle<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.079> choose<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:33.680> our

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
the angle that we choose to do our

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.100 
the angle that we choose to do our
dovetails<00:01:34.280> at<00:01:34.460> now<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.850> want<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.090> use<00:01:35.210> 14<00:01:35.689> 7

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
dovetails at now if you want to use 14 7

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.969 
dovetails at now if you want to use 14 7
9<00:01:36.320> whatever

9 whatever
that's<00:01:37.340> up<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:37.759> you'll<00:01:37.939> just<00:01:38.090> have<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.360> set

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
that's up to you you'll just have to set

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.880 
that's up to you you'll just have to set
those<00:01:38.720> angles<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.229> at<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.470> different<00:01:39.770> a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
those angles in at a different a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.249 
those angles in at a different a
different<00:01:40.130> position<00:01:40.659> when<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.689> first<00:01:42.020> built

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
different position when I first built

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.440 
different position when I first built
this<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.770> did<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> wide<00:01:43.610> area<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:44.299> between

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
this I did a wide area in between

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.030 
this I did a wide area in between
thinking<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.229> might<00:01:45.470> use<00:01:45.530> different

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
thinking that I might use different

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.609 
thinking that I might use different
router<00:01:46.280> bits<00:01:46.610> 1/2<00:01:47.240> inch<00:01:47.479> 3/4<00:01:48.170> things<00:01:48.409> like

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
router bits 1/2 inch 3/4 things like

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.039 
router bits 1/2 inch 3/4 things like
that<00:01:48.829> what<00:01:49.399> I<00:01:49.430> found<00:01:49.700> over<00:01:49.909> using<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.479> over<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
that what I found over using it over the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.899 
that what I found over using it over the
time<00:01:51.259> is<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> half-inch<00:01:52.399> router<00:01:52.640> bit

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
time is that a half-inch router bit

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.270 
time is that a half-inch router bit
works<00:01:53.119> best<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.350> order<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.649> set<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.040> up<00:01:55.159> to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
works best so in order to set it up to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.830 
works best so in order to set it up to
where<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.430> could<00:01:55.640> use<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.000> jig<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.210> actually<00:01:56.659> do

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
where I could use the jig to actually do

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.289 
where I could use the jig to actually do
my<00:01:56.990> layout<00:01:57.350> work<00:01:57.560> or<00:01:57.799> match<00:01:58.280> my<00:01:58.490> layout<00:01:58.850> work<00:01:59.060> I

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
my layout work or match my layout work I

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.060 
my layout work or match my layout work I
went<00:01:59.810> back<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.259> put<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.439> quarter<00:02:00.770> inch<00:02:00.890> piece

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
went back and put a quarter inch piece

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.340 
went back and put a quarter inch piece
of<00:02:01.100> plywood<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.759> between<00:02:02.180> tacked<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.140> both

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
of plywood in between tacked it on both

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.260 
of plywood in between tacked it on both
sides<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.950> then<00:02:04.070> set<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.549> position<00:02:04.820> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
sides and then set it in position and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.910 
sides and then set it in position and
made<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.540> cut<00:02:05.750> through<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.649> strip

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
made the cut through it so the strip

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.620 
made the cut through it so the strip
that<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.159> see<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.579> center<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.969> exactly<00:02:08.450> at

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
that you see in the center is exactly at

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.509 
that you see in the center is exactly at
1/2<00:02:08.810> inch<00:02:09.049> and<00:02:09.229> matches<00:02:09.590> my<00:02:09.739> router<00:02:10.009> bit<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
1/2 inch and matches my router bit and

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.520 
1/2 inch and matches my router bit and
you'll<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.360> where<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.630> comes<00:02:11.840> into<00:02:11.989> play<00:02:12.079> as

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
you'll see where that comes into play as

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.770 
you'll see where that comes into play as
we<00:02:12.739> start<00:02:12.980> using<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.430> piece<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.510> we're<00:02:14.660> going

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
we start using the piece so we're going

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.140 
we start using the piece so we're going
to<00:02:14.840> slide<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.170> down<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.950> take<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.579> look<00:02:16.820> at<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
to slide it down and take a look at it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.789 
to slide it down and take a look at it
now<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.510> circle<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.049> you<00:02:18.170> seen<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> back

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
now the circle that you seen in the back

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.640 
now the circle that you seen in the back
is<00:02:19.010> an<00:02:19.400> area<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.180> we're<00:02:20.390> used<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> adjust<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
is an area that we're used to adjust the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.500 
is an area that we're used to adjust the
piece<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.220> down<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.669> it<00:02:22.850> happens<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.299> fit

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
piece up and down so it happens to fit

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.390 
piece up and down so it happens to fit
with<00:02:23.630> my<00:02:23.810> router<00:02:24.079> lift<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.889> I<00:02:24.919> can<00:02:25.160> get<00:02:25.280> right

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
with my router lift so I can get right

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.620 
with my router lift so I can get right
in<00:02:25.459> here<00:02:25.699> with<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.850> wrench<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> raise<00:02:26.389> and<00:02:26.600> lower

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
in here with a wrench to raise and lower

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.590 
in here with a wrench to raise and lower
the<00:02:26.959> bit

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the bit

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.090 
the bit
I've<00:02:27.780> gone<00:02:27.900> ahead<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.200> done<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> already<00:02:28.740> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
I've gone ahead and done that already so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.860 
I've gone ahead and done that already so
we<00:02:29.220> won't<00:02:29.370> fool<00:02:29.580> with<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.510> here's<00:02:30.750> our

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
we won't fool with it so here's our

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.230 
we won't fool with it so here's our
piece<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.830> layout<00:02:32.160> now<00:02:32.730> one

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
piece that we use for layout now one

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.550 
piece that we use for layout now one
thing<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.900> different<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.350> here

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
thing that's a little different on here

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.230 
thing that's a little different on here
you'll<00:02:34.710> see<00:02:34.890> I've<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.070> marks<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.700> both<00:02:35.910> sides

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
you'll see I've got marks on both sides

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000 
you'll see I've got marks on both sides
and<00:02:36.570> that's<00:02:37.110> going<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> help<00:02:37.530> me<00:02:37.740> when<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and that's going to help me when it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
and that's going to help me when it
comes<00:02:38.130> time<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.550> use<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.880> router<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.080> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
comes time to use the router so this is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
comes time to use the router so this is
our<00:02:40.410> workpiece<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> fence<00:02:41.790> that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
our workpiece and this is the fence that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.900 
our workpiece and this is the fence that
we<00:02:42.180> showed<00:02:42.420> set<00:02:42.810> at<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.020> 12<00:02:43.290> degree<00:02:43.470> angle<00:02:44.010> we're

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
we showed set at a 12 degree angle we're

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
we showed set at a 12 degree angle we're
going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> bring<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.420> piece<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.110> we're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
going to bring the piece in and we're

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
going to bring the piece in and we're
going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.890> use<00:02:47.100> since<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.610> track<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.180> exactly

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
going to use since this track is exactly

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.570 
going to use since this track is exactly
1/2<00:02:48.990> inch<00:02:49.320> we're<00:02:49.740> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.950> use<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> make

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
1/2 inch we're going to use it to make

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400 
1/2 inch we're going to use it to make
our<00:02:50.610> cut<00:02:50.970> wherever<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.540> goes<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.080> we'll<00:02:52.200> our

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
our cut wherever this goes so we'll our

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.740 
our cut wherever this goes so we'll our
router<00:02:52.680> bit<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> we're<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.270> line<00:02:54.480> this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
router bit and we're going to line this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.540 
router bit and we're going to line this
first<00:02:55.050> mark<00:02:55.350> right<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.770> at<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.950> edge<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
first mark right up at the edge of that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.630 
first mark right up at the edge of that
cut<00:02:57.290> hold<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.680> place<00:02:58.860> add<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> couple

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
cut hold that in place add a couple

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.190 
cut hold that in place add a couple
clamps<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.270> we'll<00:03:00.360> make<00:03:00.510> our<00:03:00.690> first<00:03:00.930> pass

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
clamps and we'll make our first pass

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:21.789 
clamps and we'll make our first pass
over<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.710> router

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.869 

now<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.129> see<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.579> we're<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.849> the

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
now you can see that we're on the

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.699 
now you can see that we're on the
appropriate<00:03:24.569> angle<00:03:24.930> we're<00:03:25.170> set<00:03:25.379> up<00:03:25.409> now<00:03:25.650> we

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
appropriate angle we're set up now we

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.869 
appropriate angle we're set up now we
might<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> little<00:03:26.250> different<00:03:26.489> from<00:03:26.730> our

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
might be a little different from our

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.580 
might be a little different from our
layout<00:03:27.269> line<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:27.750> that's<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.140> big<00:03:28.379> deal

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
layout line but that's not a big deal

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
layout line but that's not a big deal
because<00:03:28.950> we're<00:03:29.159> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> come<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.180> whole

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
because we're going to come in the whole

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.449 
because we're going to come in the whole
point<00:03:30.629> here<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.049> make<00:03:31.200> these<00:03:31.590> areas<00:03:32.280> right

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
point here is to make these areas right

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.949 
point here is to make these areas right
here<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.879> pin<00:03:33.150> area<00:03:33.450> less<00:03:33.689> than<00:03:33.720> a

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
here in this pin area less than a

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.349 
here in this pin area less than a
quarter<00:03:34.319> inch<00:03:34.349> so<00:03:35.310> we've<00:03:35.519> got<00:03:35.700> our<00:03:35.849> first<00:03:36.060> area

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
quarter inch so we've got our first area

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.660 
quarter inch so we've got our first area
set<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.769> can<00:03:37.950> go<00:03:38.129> through<00:03:38.459> now<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
set in and we can go through now and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.610 
set in and we can go through now and
since<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.359> on<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.629> side<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.170> jig<00:03:40.409> and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
since we're on this side of the jig and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.330 
since we're on this side of the jig and
make<00:03:40.829> those<00:03:41.099> cuts<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.319> here<00:03:44.099> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
make those cuts here here and here and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.009 
make those cuts here here and here and
we're<00:03:45.000> going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.810> same

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
we're going to do that in the same

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.050 
we're going to do that in the same
manner<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.680> did<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.370> notice<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.849> had

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
manner we just did you notice that I had

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
manner we just did you notice that I had
the<00:03:48.180> router<00:03:48.390> bit<00:03:48.690> set<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.230> height<00:03:49.409> of<00:03:49.440> my

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
the router bit set to the height of my

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.199 
the router bit set to the height of my
scribe<00:03:50.099> line<00:03:55.220> again<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.609> need<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.879> do<00:03:57.030> is

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
scribe line again all you need to do is

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.289 
scribe line again all you need to do is
line<00:03:57.480> up<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.900> line<00:03:58.200> right<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.430> edge<00:03:59.730> and

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
line up that line right on that edge and

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:43.189 
line up that line right on that edge and
you're<00:04:00.659> ready<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.200> next<00:04:01.230> pass

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.779 

so<00:04:44.199> there's<00:04:44.440> our<00:04:44.620> cut<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:45.009> one<00:04:45.280> side<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
so there's our cut on one side of the

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.089 
so there's our cut on one side of the
dovetail<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.419> here's<00:04:46.990> what's<00:04:47.229> neat<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.919> make

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
dovetail and here's what's neat to make

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.890 
dovetail and here's what's neat to make
the<00:04:48.250> other<00:04:48.430> side<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.000> cut<00:04:49.240> we're<00:04:49.690> just

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
the other side of the cut we're just

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.360 
the other side of the cut we're just
going<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.169> move<00:04:50.379> our<00:04:50.590> piece<00:04:50.830> over<00:04:51.039> to<00:04:51.159> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
going to move our piece over to the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.980 
going to move our piece over to the
opposite<00:04:51.879> side<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.419> repeat<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.960> same

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
opposite side and repeat the same

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.640 
opposite side and repeat the same
processes<00:04:57.780> all<00:04:58.780> right<00:04:58.870> so<00:04:59.050> I've<00:04:59.199> moved<00:04:59.409> to<00:04:59.530> the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
processes all right so I've moved to the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.930 
processes all right so I've moved to the
other<00:04:59.680> side<00:04:59.889> of<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.310> jig<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.550> we're<00:05:00.759> going<00:05:00.879> to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
other side of the jig and we're going to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.279 
other side of the jig and we're going to
do<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.180> exact<00:05:01.539> same<00:05:01.569> thing

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
do the exact same thing

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.899 
do the exact same thing
there's<00:05:02.620> our<00:05:02.860> layout<00:05:03.190> line<00:05:03.460> I'm<00:05:03.699> going<00:05:03.849> to

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
there's our layout line I'm going to

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.430 
there's our layout line I'm going to
line<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.120> right<00:05:04.389> up<00:05:04.449> with<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.900> groove<00:05:05.229> and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
line it right up with that groove and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.490 
line it right up with that groove and
make<00:05:06.129> the<00:05:06.280> first<00:05:06.520> cut<00:05:06.759> now<00:05:07.659> after<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.050> make<00:05:08.289> this

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
make the first cut now after I make this

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.589 
make the first cut now after I make this
cut<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:09.039> might<00:05:09.669> see<00:05:09.909> that<00:05:10.120> there's<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.360> little

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
cut you might see that there's a little

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.890 
cut you might see that there's a little
scrap<00:05:10.870> area<00:05:11.229> left<00:05:11.440> in<00:05:11.650> between<00:05:12.120> if<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.419> we're

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
scrap area left in between if so we're

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.330 
scrap area left in between if so we're
gonna<00:05:14.020> have<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.229> clean<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.130> next

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
gonna have to clean that out on the next

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:27.580 
gonna have to clean that out on the next
pass

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.740 

so<00:05:28.590> there's<00:05:28.830> our<00:05:28.980> second<00:05:29.460> pass<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:30.030> we<00:05:30.510> see

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
so there's our second pass and we see

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.600 
so there's our second pass and we see
right<00:05:31.020> here<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.740> we<00:05:31.830> have<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.190> amount<00:05:32.460> of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
right here that we have this amount of

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.580 
right here that we have this amount of
material<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.120> has<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.390> be<00:05:33.480> cleaned<00:05:33.750> up<00:05:33.930> well

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
material that has to be cleaned up well

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.720 
material that has to be cleaned up well
I'm<00:05:34.680> going<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.860> go<00:05:35.040> through<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.460> make<00:05:35.550> the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
I'm going to go through and make the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.520 
I'm going to go through and make the
opposite<00:05:36.210> cuts<00:05:36.480> all<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.900> way<00:05:36.930> down<00:05:37.230> through

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
opposite cuts all the way down through

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.420 
opposite cuts all the way down through
again<00:05:38.370> here<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.390> here<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.020> here<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.980> then

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430

again here and here and here and then
I'll<00:05:41.610> show<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.030> layout<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.440> and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
I'll show you the layout to you and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
I'll show you the layout to you and
we'll<00:05:43.650> come<00:05:43.800> back<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.010> we'll<00:05:44.250> talk<00:05:44.400> about

we'll come back and we'll talk about

00:05:44.580 --> 00:06:30.120 
we'll come back and we'll talk about
removing<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.240> material

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.040 

now<00:06:31.130> there's<00:06:31.550> our<00:06:31.760> layout<00:06:32.210> and<00:06:32.570> what's

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
now there's our layout and what's

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.930 
now there's our layout and what's
interesting<00:06:33.320> in<00:06:33.710> here<00:06:33.980> before<00:06:34.220> I<00:06:34.430> get<00:06:34.760> this

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
interesting in here before I get this

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.810 
interesting in here before I get this
area<00:06:35.300> removed<00:06:35.720> is<00:06:36.020> this<00:06:36.560> is<00:06:36.740> our<00:06:36.860> pin<00:06:37.130> area<00:06:37.490> and

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
area removed is this is our pin area and

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.390 
area removed is this is our pin area and
look<00:06:38.450> we've<00:06:38.660> got<00:06:38.840> our<00:06:38.960> pin<00:06:39.170> area<00:06:39.470> cut<00:06:39.680> exactly

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
look we've got our pin area cut exactly

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.400 
look we've got our pin area cut exactly
down<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:41.240> where<00:06:41.420> it's<00:06:41.570> about<00:06:41.660> an<00:06:41.960> eighth<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:42.260> an

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
down to where it's about an eighth of an

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.110 
down to where it's about an eighth of an
inch<00:06:42.560> now<00:06:42.890> you<00:06:42.950> can<00:06:43.220> take<00:06:43.370> this<00:06:43.580> down<00:06:43.820> to<00:06:43.850> where

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
inch now you can take this down to where

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.090 
inch now you can take this down to where
it<00:06:44.240> would<00:06:44.360> be<00:06:44.480> classified<00:06:44.690> as<00:06:45.080> a<00:06:45.230> pin<00:06:45.560> dovetail

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
it would be classified as a pin dovetail

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.700 
it would be classified as a pin dovetail
now<00:06:46.970> if<00:06:47.120> you<00:06:47.210> missed<00:06:47.510> your<00:06:47.720> line<00:06:47.930> it's<00:06:48.410> very

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
now if you missed your line it's very

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.310 
now if you missed your line it's very
simple<00:06:49.070> to<00:06:49.190> go<00:06:49.310> back<00:06:49.520> adjust<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.330> workpiece

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
simple to go back adjust the workpiece

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.170 
simple to go back adjust the workpiece
over<00:06:51.770> towards<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.250> router<00:06:52.430> bit<00:06:52.700> a<00:06:52.760> little<00:06:52.940> bit

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
over towards the router bit a little bit

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.510 
over towards the router bit a little bit
more<00:06:53.420> and<00:06:53.570> finish<00:06:54.410> that<00:06:54.590> cut<00:06:54.860> one<00:06:55.070> more<00:06:55.100> time

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
more and finish that cut one more time

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.940 
more and finish that cut one more time
making<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:56.060> even<00:06:56.210> thinner<00:06:56.660> I'm<00:06:57.440> going<00:06:57.680> to<00:06:57.740> set

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
making it even thinner I'm going to set

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.170 
making it even thinner I'm going to set
up<00:06:58.130> and<00:06:58.400> I'm<00:06:58.460> going<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.640> take<00:06:58.790> this<00:06:58.970> material

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
up and I'm going to take this material

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.360 
up and I'm going to take this material
away<00:06:59.750> that's<00:06:59.960> waste<00:07:00.260> and<00:07:00.560> I'll<00:07:00.920> show<00:07:01.100> you<00:07:01.130> the

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.170 
can see all the areas are cut down we've

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.670 
can see all the areas are cut down we've
got<00:07:34.200> a<00:07:34.620> nice<00:07:35.130> small<00:07:35.700> area<00:07:36.180> here<00:07:36.240> so<00:07:36.750> with<00:07:37.440> the

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
got a nice small area here so with the

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.100 
got a nice small area here so with the
through<00:07:37.920> dovetail<00:07:38.460> now<00:07:38.670> using<00:07:39.540> a<00:07:39.630> router<00:07:39.840> in

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
through dovetail now using a router in

through dovetail now using a router in
this<00:07:40.290> scenario<00:07:40.620> we<00:07:41.010> can<00:07:41.250> get<00:07:41.520> this<00:07:41.730> pin<00:07:42.000> area

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330 
this scenario we can get this pin area

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.090 
this scenario we can get this pin area
down<00:07:42.630> below<00:07:42.780> a<00:07:42.930> quarter<00:07:43.200> inch<00:07:43.530> something
