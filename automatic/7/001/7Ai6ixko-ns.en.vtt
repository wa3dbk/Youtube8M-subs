00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
a little robot or sometimes a night or

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.890 
a little robot or sometimes a night or
something<00:00:43.610> like<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.790> or<00:00:44.060> a<00:00:44.240> soldier<00:00:44.720> and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
something like that or a soldier and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.890 
something like that or a soldier and
brought<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.680> into<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:46.040> robot<00:00:46.520> by<00:00:46.970> my<00:00:47.270> robot<00:00:47.690> I

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
brought it into a robot by my robot I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.930 
brought it into a robot by my robot I
mean<00:00:48.140> they've<00:00:48.320> added<00:00:48.739> sensor<00:00:49.250> technologies

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
mean they've added sensor technologies

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.210 
mean they've added sensor technologies
as<00:00:50.180> well<00:00:50.450> as<00:00:50.750> some<00:00:51.020> sort<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.380> intelligence<00:00:52.100> and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
as well as some sort of intelligence and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.639 
as well as some sort of intelligence and
then<00:00:52.610> some<00:00:52.970> sort<00:00:53.270> of<00:00:53.390> movement<00:00:53.690> those<00:00:54.380> are<00:00:54.560> the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
then some sort of movement those are the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.470 
then some sort of movement those are the
three<00:00:54.890> things<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.280> need<00:00:55.340> for<00:00:55.790> any<00:00:55.970> class<00:00:56.239> of

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
three things you need for any class of

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.210 
three things you need for any class of
robot<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.260> again<00:00:57.440> they<00:00:57.530> built<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:57.950> number<00:00:58.160> of

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
robot so again they built in a number of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.310 
robot so again they built in a number of
sensors<00:00:58.579> feedback<00:00:59.390> from<00:00:59.570> those<00:00:59.720> sensors<00:01:00.110> the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
sensors feedback from those sensors the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200 
sensors feedback from those sensors the
intelligence<00:01:00.860> uses<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.430> make<00:01:01.670> some<00:01:01.910> sort<00:01:02.120> of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
intelligence uses that make some sort of

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.999 
intelligence uses that make some sort of
decisions<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.899> then<00:01:03.320> if<00:01:03.470> they<00:01:03.620> were<00:01:03.680> able<00:01:03.920> to

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
decisions and then if they were able to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.709 
decisions and then if they were able to
move<00:01:04.189> in<00:01:04.460> those<00:01:04.579> decisions<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.239> act<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
move in those decisions and act in the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:06.789 
move in those decisions and act in the
real<00:01:05.929> world<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.380> that's<00:01:06.560> what's

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
real world and that's what's

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.099 
real world and that's what's
differentiates<00:01:07.549> at<00:01:07.789> those<00:01:07.999> from<00:01:08.630> traditional

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
differentiates at those from traditional

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:10.749 
differentiates at those from traditional
toys<00:01:09.319> which<00:01:09.679> don't<00:01:09.920> have<00:01:10.069> intelligent<00:01:10.609> or

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
sounds so that it appeals to people and

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.509 
sounds so that it appeals to people and
found<00:02:21.730> people<00:02:22.090> find<00:02:22.329> it<00:02:22.450> very<00:02:22.659> very<00:02:22.930> appealing

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
found people find it very very appealing

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.860 
found people find it very very appealing
another<00:02:24.519> type<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.819> robot<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.359> saw<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.810> was

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
another type of robot we saw here was

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.259 
another type of robot we saw here was
the<00:02:26.049> I<00:02:26.079> Theory<00:02:26.799> robot<00:02:26.980> coming<00:02:27.549> across<00:02:27.730> which

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
the I Theory robot coming across which

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.030 
the I Theory robot coming across which
is<00:02:28.420> basically<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.989> robot<00:02:29.379> which<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.680> used<00:02:29.889> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
is basically a robot which is used to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.280 
is basically a robot which is used to
again<00:02:30.489> communicate<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.299> people<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:31.840> hear

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
again communicate with people and hear

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.800 
again communicate with people and hear
its<00:02:32.439> length<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.889> less<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.670> sensor<00:02:34.120> interaction

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
its length of less of sensor interaction

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.690 
its length of less of sensor interaction
they<00:02:35.139> can<00:02:35.409> tell<00:02:35.650> when<00:02:35.829> people's<00:02:36.159> come<00:02:36.370> up<00:02:36.549> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
they can tell when people's come up to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.879 
they can tell when people's come up to
it<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.939> then<00:02:37.359> either<00:02:37.629> play<00:02:38.049> something<00:02:38.530> or<00:02:38.680> say

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
it and then either play something or say

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.259 
it and then either play something or say
something<00:02:38.919> that's<00:02:39.519> appropriate<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.120> that

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
something that's appropriate for that

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.690 
something that's appropriate for that
time<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:41.169> a<00:02:41.200> variety<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.769> type<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.219> robotic

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
time so a variety of type of robotic

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.059 
time so a variety of type of robotic
types<00:02:42.969> here<00:02:43.269> by<00:02:43.750> consumer<00:02:44.319> robotics<00:02:44.829> for<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
types here by consumer robotics for the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.679 
types here by consumer robotics for the
most<00:02:45.280> part<00:02:45.459> we're<00:02:45.639> talking<00:02:46.060> about<00:02:46.150> robots

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
most part we're talking about robots

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.209 
most part we're talking about robots
that<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:46.930> purchased<00:02:47.169> by<00:02:47.469> individuals<00:02:48.040> when

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
that are purchased by individuals when

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.429 
that are purchased by individuals when
use<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.639> home<00:02:48.669> in<00:02:49.090> some<00:02:49.569> cases<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:50.079> Paro

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
use in the home in some cases with Paro

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.569

purchased by larger organizations but

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.679 
purchased by larger organizations but
main<00:02:57.099> thing<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.370> they<00:02:57.669> interact<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.269> people

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
main thing is they interact with people

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.659 
main thing is they interact with people
in<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.019> one-to-one<00:02:59.409> way<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.189> that's<00:03:00.519> what

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
in a one-to-one way and that's what

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.909 
in a one-to-one way and that's what
makes<00:03:00.939> them<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.209> consumer<00:03:01.810> robot<00:03:02.199> so<00:03:02.680> again<00:03:02.889> a

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
makes them a consumer robot so again a

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.890 
makes them a consumer robot so again a
variety<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.519> interesting<00:03:03.969> robots<00:03:04.359> here<00:03:04.750> and
