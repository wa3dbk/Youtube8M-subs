00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the magazine in there and it's not that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.529 
the magazine in there and it's not that
fast<00:01:25.250> not<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.729> efficient<00:01:26.180> when<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.329> do<00:01:26.420> have

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
fast not that efficient when you do have

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.160 
fast not that efficient when you do have
to<00:01:26.630> rock<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.950> MF<00:01:28.250> or<00:01:28.869> which<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:29.990> have

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
to rock it in on the MF or which I have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.580 
to rock it in on the MF or which I have
here<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:32.119> again<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.390> can<00:01:32.539> see<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:33.049> takes<00:01:33.350> five

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
here and again you can see it takes five

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.529 
here and again you can see it takes five
minutes<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.009> put<00:01:34.159> on<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.460> will<00:01:34.490> fit<00:01:34.729> 90%<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
minutes to put on it will fit 90% of the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
minutes to put on it will fit 90% of the
a<00:01:35.570> cave<00:01:35.929> platform<00:01:36.500> that's<00:01:36.679> out<00:01:36.799> there<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.369> it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
a cave platform that's out there and it

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.340 
a cave platform that's out there and it
just<00:01:37.939> bolts<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:38.869> there<00:01:39.020> with<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.170> couple

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
just bolts right in there with a couple

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.160 
just bolts right in there with a couple
of<00:01:39.439> screws<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:41.210> actually<00:01:41.509> take<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.750> gun<00:01:41.929> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
of screws you actually take the gun and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.130 
of screws you actually take the gun and
jam<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.039> magazine<00:01:43.429> in<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:43.759> lot<00:01:44.119> faster<00:01:44.659> way

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
jam the magazine in a lot faster way

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.550 
jam the magazine in a lot faster way
more<00:01:45.380> efficient<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:47.719> know<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.200> it's

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
more efficient you know it's it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.889 
more efficient you know it's it's
probably<00:01:48.950> one<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.700> best<00:01:49.939> five<00:01:50.539> minute

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
probably one of the the best five minute

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.139 
probably one of the the best five minute
under<00:01:51.350> $50<00:01:51.950> mod<00:01:52.189> can<00:01:52.460> put<00:01:52.640> on<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> gun

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
under $50 mod can put on the gun

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.330
