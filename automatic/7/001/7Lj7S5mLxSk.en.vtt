propane lamp working torches that are on

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
propane lamp working torches that are on
the<00:01:14.580> market<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:17.700> used<00:01:18.299> standard<00:01:19.200> plumber's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the market we used standard plumber's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.130 
the market we used standard plumber's
torch<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> would<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.600> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
torch to see if that would work and we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.810 
torch to see if that would work and we
could<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.530> bring<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> Capri<00:01:23.460> effect

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
could not bring out the Capri effect

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
could not bring out the Capri effect
with<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> standard<00:01:25.100> plumber's<00:01:26.100> torch<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:28.130> we

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
with a standard plumber's torch so we

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.060 
with a standard plumber's torch so we
suggest<00:01:30.079> torches<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.409> made<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
suggest torches that are made for

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.140 
suggest torches that are made for
lampworking<00:01:32.549> only<00:01:34.250> now<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> start<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
lampworking only now you can start out

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
lampworking only now you can start out
using<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.990> oxygen<00:01:37.799> propane<00:01:38.729> torch<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.380> shape

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
using the oxygen propane torch to shape

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.520 
using the oxygen propane torch to shape
your<00:01:40.770> bead<00:01:40.979> work<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> way<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
your bead work at the way you want to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
your bead work at the way you want to
but<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.710> you'll<00:01:43.860> need<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> switch<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:45.299> all

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but then you'll need to switch to an all

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.780 
but then you'll need to switch to an all
propane<00:01:46.020> torch<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.590> bring<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.189> coppery

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
propane torch to bring out the coppery

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.359 
propane torch to bring out the coppery
effect<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.720> fairly<00:01:52.649> simple<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.189> bring

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
effect now it's fairly simple to bring

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.270 
effect now it's fairly simple to bring
out<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.790> coppery<00:01:54.570> color<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> surface<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
out the coppery color in the surface of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
out the coppery color in the surface of
the<00:01:56.369> glass<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.469> need<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> learn<00:01:58.860> how<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the glass but you need to learn how to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
the glass but you need to learn how to
do<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> trick<00:02:00.450> once<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
do it and there is a trick once you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.779 
do it and there is a trick once you
learn<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.619> trick<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:04.100> works<00:02:05.100> quite<00:02:05.640> well

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.790 

basically<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.239> need<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> melt<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> glass<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
basically you need to melt the glass and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.940 
basically you need to melt the glass and
form<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.220> bead<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.379> then<00:02:13.379> pull<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.770> from

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
form your bead and then pull it from

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.559 
form your bead and then pull it from
from<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> flame<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.450> allow<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.959> cool<00:02:17.569> once

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
from the flame and allow it to cool once

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.110 
from the flame and allow it to cool once
it<00:02:18.780> cools<00:02:19.280> slightly<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.940> no<00:02:21.090> longer

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
it cools slightly so that it no longer

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.040 
it cools slightly so that it no longer
close<00:02:22.310> brush<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.640> B<00:02:23.790> quickly<00:02:24.390> back<00:02:24.629> into<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
close brush the B quickly back into the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.520 
close brush the B quickly back into the
flame<00:02:25.520> right<00:02:26.520> at<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> tip<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.530> blue

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

flame right at the tip of the blue
portion<00:02:28.800> where<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.640> form<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.030> bead<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.790> in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
portion where you form your bead and in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.589 
portion where you form your bead and in
and<00:02:33.060> out<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.470> watch<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.599> Capri

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
and out you can just watch that Capri

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.130 
and out you can just watch that Capri
effect<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:38.400> surface<00:02:39.560> onto<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.680> bead<00:02:42.140> now
