00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.809 
same information I was getting from the
page<00:03:29.109> so<00:03:29.349> I<00:03:29.379> decided<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.919> remove<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.459> video

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.270 
page so I decided to remove that video
just<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.900> guys<00:03:32.109> knew<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:33.040> wasn't

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
just so you guys knew that that wasn't

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.369 
just so you guys knew that that wasn't
really<00:03:33.549> confirmed<00:03:34.449> information<00:03:34.720> or<00:03:35.079> anything

really confirmed information or anything
like<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:35.949> as<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.340> see<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.730> says

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
like that but as you can see it says

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.939 
like that but as you can see it says
