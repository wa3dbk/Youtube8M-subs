00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
imagine how bad the first one is so I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.590 
imagine how bad the first one is so I
would<00:01:28.500> suggest<00:01:28.770> never<00:01:29.490> even<00:01:29.790> looking<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
would suggest never even looking at this

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
would suggest never even looking at this
game<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.229> were<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.920> looking<00:01:32.310> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
game because they were just looking just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.429 
game because they were just looking just
looking<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> cover<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.900> game<00:01:34.140> gave

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
looking at the cover of this game gave

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:34.999 
looking at the cover of this game gave
me<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> headache

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
me a headache

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
me a headache
and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.430> thought<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.970> should<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.780> thought<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and I thought I should have thought I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.179 
and I thought I should have thought I
should<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.290> realized<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.950> while

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
should have realized then that while

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
should have realized then that while
this<00:01:38.369> game<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:39.990> bad

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
this game is gonna be really really bad

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
this game is gonna be really really bad
so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.680> should<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.250> even<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:42.000> anything

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so I should just not even do anything

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
so I should just not even do anything
with<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.759> friends
