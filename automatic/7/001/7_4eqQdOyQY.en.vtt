00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
great albums in the 70s I think they

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.369 
great albums in the 70s I think they
were<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.549> first<00:01:00.760> signing<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.960> Beatles

Apple label as well and I suppose they

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.929 
Apple label as well and I suppose they
were<00:01:05.440> an<00:01:05.710> early<00:01:05.979> example<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.610> what's<00:01:06.789> now

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939

prompted to film this lesson when a

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.950 
prompted to film this lesson when a
private<00:01:24.130> student<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.700> mine<00:01:24.880> requested<00:01:25.420> that

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
he learned this song and I dug it out

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.630 
he learned this song and I dug it out
figured<00:01:28.959> out<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.590> riff<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.039> just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
figured out the the riff and just

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.070 
figured out the the riff and just
reminded<00:01:31.000> me<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:31.209> a<00:01:31.270> great<00:01:31.509> band

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
reminded me what a great band

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.260 
reminded me what a great band
Badfinger<00:01:32.409> were<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.670> what<00:01:33.789> a<00:01:33.819> great<00:01:33.970> riff

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
Badfinger were and what a great riff

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.330 
Badfinger were and what a great riff
this<00:01:34.539> this<00:01:34.990> one<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.289> particular<00:01:35.409> is<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.159> I

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
this this one in particular is so I

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.830 
this this one in particular is so I
think<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.819> lot<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.060> fun<00:01:37.299> learning<00:01:37.720> how

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
think you have a lot of fun learning how

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
think you have a lot of fun learning how
to<00:01:37.869> play<00:01:38.110> I'm<00:01:38.289> just<00:01:38.409> going<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.590> move<00:01:38.679> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
to play I'm just going to move the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.859 
to play I'm just going to move the
camera<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.310> bit<00:01:39.520> closer<00:01:39.909> then<00:01:40.240> I'll<00:01:40.360> show<00:01:40.810> you

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
camera a bit closer then I'll show you

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.190 
camera a bit closer then I'll show you
how<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.140> goes<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.390> first<00:01:43.720> thing<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:43.959> want<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
how it goes the first thing I want to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.050 
how it goes the first thing I want to
mention<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.679> tuning<00:01:45.520> now<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.909> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
mention is the tuning now on the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.510 
mention is the tuning now on the
recording<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.780> think<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.890> guitar<00:01:48.490> is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
recording I think that the guitar is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.840 
recording I think that the guitar is
tuned<00:01:49.149> down<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.780> tone<00:01:50.079> or<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> whole<00:01:50.680> step<00:01:51.159> so

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
tuned down a tone or a whole step so

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.520 
tuned down a tone or a whole step so
from<00:01:52.149> low<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.390> high<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> strings<00:01:53.409> are

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
from low to high that the strings are

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.770 
from low to high that the strings are
going<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.829> D<00:01:54.130> G<00:01:54.700> C<00:01:54.969> F<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:56.520> D<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.450> gives

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
going to be D G C F a D and that gives

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.480 
going to be D G C F a D and that gives
the<00:01:59.049> whole<00:01:59.229> riff<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.679> wonderful<00:02:00.189> kind<00:02:00.399> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
the whole riff a wonderful kind of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.539 
the whole riff a wonderful kind of
weight<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.229> heaviness<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:03.189> that<00:02:03.310> was<00:02:03.429> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
weight and heaviness and that was the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.950 
weight and heaviness and that was the
way<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:03.670> was<00:02:03.789> playing<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.299> at<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.539> start<00:02:04.780> of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
way I was playing it at the start of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.319 
way I was playing it at the start of
this<00:02:05.109> lesson<00:02:05.619> for<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.399> teaching<00:02:06.820> segment

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
this lesson for this teaching segment

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.910 
this lesson for this teaching segment
I've<00:02:07.659> actually<00:02:07.810> gone<00:02:08.079> back<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.500> standard

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
I've actually gone back to standard

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.469 
I've actually gone back to standard
tuning<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.759> because<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.000> thought<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.239> would

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
tuning just because I thought that would

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.140 
tuning just because I thought that would
make<00:02:10.959> things<00:02:11.170> easier<00:02:11.739> for<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.730> you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
make things easier for you and you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.240 
make things easier for you and you
wouldn't<00:02:13.299> have<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> hassle<00:02:14.049> of<00:02:14.250> retuning

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
wouldn't have all the hassle of retuning

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.949 
wouldn't have all the hassle of retuning
obviously<00:02:16.090> if<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.359> do<00:02:16.480> want<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.720> play<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
obviously if you do want to play it

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.509 
obviously if you do want to play it
exactly<00:02:17.350> like<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.709> recording<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> want

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
exactly like the recording if you want

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.550 
exactly like the recording if you want
to<00:02:18.579> play<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.820> along<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> recording<00:02:19.930> then

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
to play it along to the recording then

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.949 
to play it along to the recording then
you're<00:02:20.680> going<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.859> need<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.570> detune<00:02:22.570> your

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you're going to need to detune your

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.099 
you're going to need to detune your
guitar<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.760> I'm<00:02:24.850> showing<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.329> you<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.930> in

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
guitar but I'm showing it to you now in

standard<00:02:26.440> tuning<00:02:26.590> as<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:26.890> say<00:02:27.010> everything<00:02:27.400> else

is<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> same<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.180> fingering<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
is the same the fingering and the

you but onto the the riff it's self then

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.069 
you but onto the the riff it's self then
and<00:02:36.400> we're<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.609> to<00:02:36.640> start<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.180> this

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.690 

we're<00:02:42.500> playing<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.799> third<00:02:43.040> fret<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> low

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760

that<00:02:54.879> D<00:02:55.879> note<00:02:56.120> again<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:56.659> it's<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.840> different<00:02:57.260> D

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that D note again but it's a different D

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500 
that D note again but it's a different D
note<00:02:57.709> we're<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.069> playing<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.030> D<00:02:59.239> which

note we're now playing the the D which

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.110 
note we're now playing the the D which
is<00:02:59.629> at<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.870> fifth<00:03:00.140> fret<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.859> 5th<00:03:01.489> string

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
is at the fifth fret on the 5th string

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.589 
is at the fifth fret on the 5th string
and<00:03:02.329> that's<00:03:02.870> followed<00:03:03.170> by<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.849> 4th<00:03:05.269> fret<00:03:05.540> on

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
and that's followed by the 4th fret on

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.039 
and that's followed by the 4th fret on
the<00:03:05.750> 4th<00:03:06.079> string<00:03:06.439> and<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.700> 2nd<00:03:08.329> fret<00:03:08.750> on<00:03:08.959> the

the 4th string and the 2nd fret on the
3rd<00:03:09.470> string<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:11.870> we've<00:03:12.019> got<00:03:12.230> kind<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.739> a

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
3rd string so really we've got kind of a

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.979 
3rd string so really we've got kind of a
G<00:03:13.189> triad<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> D<00:03:16.819> tried<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.599> although<00:03:17.750> if

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
G triad to a D tried that although if

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.990 
G triad to a D tried that although if
it's<00:03:18.109> all<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:18.439> tuned<00:03:18.739> down<00:03:18.980> that's<00:03:19.669> actually

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
it's all all tuned down that's actually

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.030 
it's all all tuned down that's actually
going<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> make<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.480> some<00:03:20.750> an<00:03:20.900> F<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.680> see

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
going to make it some an F to it to see

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.720 
going to make it some an F to it to see
try<00:03:22.519> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
try it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.750 
try it
that's<00:03:23.269> not<00:03:23.450> too<00:03:23.599> confusing<00:03:24.079> for<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:27.760> that's

sounds good if you let those two notes
ring<00:03:52.040> together

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.120
