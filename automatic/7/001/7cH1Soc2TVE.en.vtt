00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.180
 the second stage in this round as mail the olympus tourstart in animal park all 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hans Venneker an end 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.480
 and if the riders is ready then 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.270
 and the wheels are checked the legs are van der z we take a look at it 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.309
 the track 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.270
 of all hans between genes 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.769
 towards the flevo polder 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.449
 on the dike to enkhuizen 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.340
 to finish to 100 70 kilometers 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.630
 in Alkmaar 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.019
 soon after the start 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.730
 creates a leading group with four riders 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.640
 13 de vries the dries dutch became the caller 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.220
 sprinting his countrymen jorens meter and watching a ritchie moth 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.310
 if there is driving in the flevo polder then there will be a big fight 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.640
 and there was a leading group of any kind from 62 years and was 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.430
 here drive towards the dike the dike towards enkhuizen and there it is 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.370
 a big gang because the wind 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.829
 she states that the pills are tons, but in the final we still have a small one 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.749
 leading group 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.839
 and a very small leading group from which they rode this arno van der zwet the first way 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.400
 and he took the victory for the coca cycling team 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.320
 according to jeff vermeulen and wouter wippert but build these have you ever earned 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.770
 not yet 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.470
 yes this site he deserves but I already have the larosiÃ¨re france also a few 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 times such a jam easy because it just not 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.040
 and now on the side everything together and there it comes with the scandal 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260
 there was also an analysis, so he drove away 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.890
 the last two kilometers in fourth place on the cobblestones 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.790
 enschede on a bit quiet for demented man strong to the right 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.680
 and then it certainly went away with the end 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.420
 9 a big enough that otherwise 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 hit like a tough fight 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.370
 And yes yes, because such a strong wind plays great force majeure 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.390
 also from lelystad he says that was the result all day long 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.150
 and if I were somewhere I know for that matter 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.630
 I was fresh enough to do the final so that will be a great relief 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.260
 cucumber time saves you are familiar with that work 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.670
 drove it for years 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.049
 So anyway it's a daily viewing right now so the chances are higher 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.339
 there is cinema, we will see 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.009
 and put all of the sweater on the sensitive plate for a moment here 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.889
 homage 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.439
 from the stage winner 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.479
 a man who makes a nice jump in the general classification 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.529
 take a look at today's top 10 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.469
 from os it became formal that we already knew that than the new zealanders 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.909
 clinton and left 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.639
 which finishes in fourth place many Dutch who are in the top 10 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.949
 Then take a look at the general classification, which feels really good 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.229
 standing in the white leader's jersey for the third consecutive day is also possible 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.409
 in the lead
