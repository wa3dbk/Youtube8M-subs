and Jasper Travis eventually learns all
like<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> killing<00:04:48.850> isn't<00:04:49.000> all<00:04:49.180> it's<00:04:49.300> cracked

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
like the killing isn't all it's cracked

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.969 
like the killing isn't all it's cracked
up<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.810> be<00:04:49.930> even<00:04:50.410> if<00:04:50.500> he<00:04:50.590> does<00:04:50.740> take<00:04:50.949> the

up to be even if he does take the
selfish<00:04:51.430> route<00:04:51.610> at<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.850> end<00:04:52.199> Jack<00:04:53.199> is<00:04:53.470> simply

selfish route at the end Jack is simply

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.620 
selfish route at the end Jack is simply
a<00:04:54.220> pawn<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.850> doesn't<00:04:55.150> learn<00:04:55.300> anything

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
a pawn and doesn't learn anything

about<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.700> character<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.900> even<00:05:29.020> without

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
about the character and even without

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.110 
about the character and even without
motivations<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.160> just<00:05:30.400> thought<00:05:30.520> Travis<00:05:30.910> to<00:05:31.000> be

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
motivations I just thought Travis to be

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.510 
motivations I just thought Travis to be
the<00:05:31.240> more<00:05:31.450> engaging<00:05:31.780> character<00:05:32.500> when<00:05:33.099> he<00:05:33.280> pops

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
the more engaging character when he pops

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.010 
the more engaging character when he pops
on<00:05:33.729> screen<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.180> I<00:05:34.210> just<00:05:34.419> can't<00:05:34.599> wait<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.900> see

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
on screen and I just can't wait to see

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.510 
on screen and I just can't wait to see
what<00:05:35.169> he<00:05:35.289> does<00:05:35.470> next<00:05:35.740> whether<00:05:36.280> he<00:05:36.370> does

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
what he does next whether he does

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.629 
what he does next whether he does
something<00:05:36.669> funny<00:05:37.060> awesome<00:05:37.780> or<00:05:37.930> stupid<00:05:38.320> and

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
something funny awesome or stupid and

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.430 
something funny awesome or stupid and
that's<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.880> reason<00:05:40.210> why<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.389> think<00:05:40.900> Travis<00:05:41.080> is

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
that's the reason why I think Travis is

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.200 
that's the reason why I think Travis is
the<00:05:41.680> better<00:05:41.830> kid
