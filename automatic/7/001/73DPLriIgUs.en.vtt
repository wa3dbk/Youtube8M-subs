so these are the instructions for an

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.540 
so these are the instructions for an
origami<00:00:10.150> lotus<00:00:10.900> flower<00:00:11.350> so<00:00:12.040> for<00:00:12.250> the<00:00:12.309> origami

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
origami lotus flower so for the origami

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.120 
origami lotus flower so for the origami
lotus<00:00:12.790> flower<00:00:13.180> we're<00:00:14.080> gonna<00:00:14.200> start<00:00:14.590> with<00:00:14.799> a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
lotus flower we're gonna start with a

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.010 
lotus flower we're gonna start with a
blintz<00:00:15.790> fold<00:00:16.090> in<00:00:16.360> order<00:00:16.540> to<00:00:16.630> get<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.810> blintz

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
blintz fold in order to get the blintz

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.660 
blintz fold in order to get the blintz
fold<00:00:17.170> we<00:00:17.260> have<00:00:17.349> to<00:00:17.439> find<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.770> exact<00:00:18.160> center<00:00:18.640> of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
fold we have to find the exact center of

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.880 
fold we have to find the exact center of
the<00:00:18.910> paper<00:00:19.090> so<00:00:20.020> we're<00:00:20.200> going<00:00:20.349> to<00:00:20.439> fold<00:00:20.680> a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
the paper so we're going to fold a

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.570 
the paper so we're going to fold a
diagonal<00:00:21.279> crease<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.680> make<00:00:23.980> sure<00:00:24.250> that<00:00:24.430> it's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
diagonal crease so make sure that it's

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.390 
diagonal crease so make sure that it's
nice<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:25.090> exact<00:00:25.690> where<00:00:25.960> you<00:00:26.050> can<00:00:26.260> see<00:00:26.500> these

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
nice and exact where you can see these

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.890 
nice and exact where you can see these
the<00:00:27.789> two<00:00:27.940> points<00:00:28.240> are<00:00:28.330> right<00:00:28.420> on<00:00:28.570> top<00:00:28.720> of<00:00:28.750> each

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
the two points are right on top of each

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.420 
the two points are right on top of each
other<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:29.289> just<00:00:29.350> make<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.710> little<00:00:29.859> tack<00:00:30.190> right

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
other and just make a little tack right

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.410 
other and just make a little tack right
here<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.609> don't<00:00:30.699> have<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.910> make<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.210> whole

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
here you don't have to make the whole

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.950 
here you don't have to make the whole
crease<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:33.160> make<00:00:33.309> a<00:00:33.340> little<00:00:33.610> little<00:00:33.940> mark<00:00:34.239> so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
crease just make a little little mark so

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.040 
crease just make a little little mark so
that<00:00:35.170> that<00:00:35.949> little<00:00:36.879> crease<00:00:37.210> shows<00:00:37.510> up<00:00:37.750> I'm

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
that that little crease shows up I'm

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.970 
that that little crease shows up I'm
gonna<00:00:38.170> do<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.379> same<00:00:38.410> thing<00:00:38.769> on<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.949> other

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
gonna do the same thing on the other

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.829 
gonna do the same thing on the other
side<00:00:39.340> go<00:00:40.120> ahead<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.300> find<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.629> other

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
side go ahead and find the other

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.780 
side go ahead and find the other
diagonal<00:00:41.260> fold<00:00:41.650> get<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.010> nice<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.220> lined<00:00:42.610> up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
diagonal fold get it nice and lined up

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.250 
diagonal fold get it nice and lined up
and<00:00:43.000> then<00:00:43.089> just<00:00:43.239> make<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.420> little<00:00:43.780> crease<00:00:44.019> right

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
and then just make a little crease right

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.630 
and then just make a little crease right
there<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.650> you<00:00:44.769> only<00:00:44.949> need<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.309> only<00:00:45.400> part

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
there and you only need the only part

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.799 
there and you only need the only part
that's<00:00:45.790> important<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.299> right<00:00:46.540> where<00:00:46.720> they

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
that's important is right where they

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.049 
that's important is right where they
intersect<00:00:47.049> that's<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.280> exact<00:00:48.610> middle<00:00:48.879> of<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
intersect that's the exact middle of the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.630 
intersect that's the exact middle of the
paper<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:50.320> we're<00:00:50.470> gonna<00:00:50.589> take<00:00:50.830> all<00:00:51.100> four

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
paper now we're gonna take all four

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.570 
paper now we're gonna take all four
corners<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.330> we're<00:00:52.540> going<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:52.720> fold<00:00:52.960> those

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
corners and we're going to fold those

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.560 
corners and we're going to fold those
into<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.729> center<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.299> that<00:00:56.260> intersection<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
into the center of that intersection so

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.549 
into the center of that intersection so
go<00:00:58.720> all<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.199> way<00:00:59.229> around<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.850> fold<00:01:01.180> up<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.659> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
go all the way around and fold up to the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.090 
go all the way around and fold up to the
center<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.369> intersection<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:05.799> a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
center of the intersection and this is a

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.180 
center of the intersection and this is a
blintz<00:01:06.580> base<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.080> fold<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.920> first

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
blintz base when you fold it the first

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.000 
blintz base when you fold it the first
time<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.840> we're<00:01:11.409> actually<00:01:11.530> going<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:11.860> do<00:01:11.979> a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
time now we're actually going to do a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.310 
time now we're actually going to do a
second<00:01:12.579> blintz<00:01:12.820> base<00:01:12.880> as<00:01:13.240> well<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:14.229> we're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
second blintz base as well so we're

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.289 
second blintz base as well so we're
gonna<00:01:14.409> take<00:01:14.619> all<00:01:14.859> four<00:01:15.219> of<00:01:15.250> these<00:01:15.490> new<00:01:15.789> corners

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
gonna take all four of these new corners

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.630 
gonna take all four of these new corners
and<00:01:16.530> fold<00:01:17.530> them<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.390> Center<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.640> work

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
and fold them into that Center and work

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.249 
and fold them into that Center and work
that<00:01:21.850> all<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:23.020> way<00:01:23.170> around<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.840> called<00:01:26.079> a

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
that all the way around this is called a

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.240 
that all the way around this is called a
double<00:01:26.560> Blinn<00:01:26.950> space

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.219 

just<00:01:34.250> like<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.630> now<00:01:35.630> after<00:01:35.840> you've<00:01:36.080> done

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
just like that now after you've done

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.710 
just like that now after you've done
that<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.100> next<00:01:37.130> step<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.060> triple<00:01:38.540> blood

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
that the next step is a triple blood

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.530 
that the next step is a triple blood
space<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.290> we're<00:01:39.380> gonna<00:01:39.500> do<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.740> one<00:01:39.890> more<00:01:39.950> time

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
space so we're gonna do it one more time

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.600 
space so we're gonna do it one more time
go<00:01:41.540> for<00:01:41.750> all<00:01:41.899> four<00:01:42.170> corners<00:01:42.470> fold<00:01:43.100> those<00:01:43.310> into

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
go for all four corners fold those into

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.330 
go for all four corners fold those into
the<00:01:43.700> middle<00:01:44.530> again<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.830> paper<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.189> gonna

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the middle again the paper is gonna

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.219 
the middle again the paper is gonna
start<00:01:46.640> getting<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.060> little<00:01:47.479> thick<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:48.020> but

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
start getting a little thick here but

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.410 
start getting a little thick here but
that's<00:01:48.409> okay<00:01:50.560> go<00:01:51.560> ahead<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.220> get<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.240> all

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
that's okay go ahead and get that all

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.690 
that's okay go ahead and get that all
the<00:01:53.450> way<00:01:53.659> up<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:54.950> helpful<00:01:55.430> if<00:01:55.549> they

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
the way up and it is helpful if they

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.359 
the way up and it is helpful if they
don't<00:01:55.880> touch<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:57.920> they<00:01:58.070> don't<00:01:58.220> overlap

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
don't touch so that they don't overlap

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.010 
don't touch so that they don't overlap
on<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.820> edges<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.270> will<00:01:59.390> make<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.780> little

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
on the edges that will make it a little

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.149 
on the edges that will make it a little
bit<00:02:00.259> simpler<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.720> like<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.380> now

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
bit simpler for you like that and now

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.540 
bit simpler for you like that and now
flip<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.670> whole<00:02:04.970> thing<00:02:05.030> over<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.550> we're

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
flip the whole thing over and we're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.009 
flip the whole thing over and we're
doing<00:02:07.670> one<00:02:07.819> more<00:02:07.940> blunt<00:02:08.179> space<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> is

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
doing one more blunt space and this is

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.960 
doing one more blunt space and this is
after<00:02:09.410> we've<00:02:09.649> folded<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.340> paper<00:02:10.369> over<00:02:10.729> so

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
after we've folded the paper over so

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.199 
after we've folded the paper over so
it's<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:11.299> in<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.450> opposite<00:02:11.989> direction<00:02:13.209> so

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
it's going in the opposite direction so

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.039 
it's going in the opposite direction so
that<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.780> fourth<00:02:15.340> Flint<00:02:16.340> space<00:02:17.049> that

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
that is the fourth Flint space that

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.199 
that is the fourth Flint space that
we've<00:02:18.200> done<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:18.830> sheet<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.580> paper<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.060> it

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
we've done on that sheet of paper and it

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.990 
we've done on that sheet of paper and it
does<00:02:20.420> get<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:21.100> little<00:02:22.100> thick<00:02:22.340> here<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.819> does

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
does get a little thick here and it does

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.520 
does get a little thick here and it does
get<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.330> little<00:02:23.360> tiny

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.800 

so<00:02:30.520> after<00:02:30.820> we've<00:02:30.940> done<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.510> fourth

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so after we've done the fourth

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.200 
so after we've done the fourth
blendspace<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.470> full<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.770> those<00:02:32.920> all<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.310> we're

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
blendspace we full of those all up we're

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.540 
blendspace we full of those all up we're
gonna<00:02:34.300> fold<00:02:34.660> one<00:02:35.380> corner<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
gonna fold one corner and this is the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.670 
gonna fold one corner and this is the
hardest<00:02:36.940> step<00:02:37.210> here<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.020> really<00:02:38.290> doesn't<00:02:38.560> want

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
hardest step here it really doesn't want

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800 
hardest step here it really doesn't want
to<00:02:38.740> do<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.100> fold<00:02:39.250> one<00:02:39.460> corner<00:02:39.490> down<00:02:40.030> about

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
to do it just fold one corner down about

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.870 
to do it just fold one corner down about
half<00:02:41.140> way<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.890> not<00:02:42.070> going<00:02:42.370> all<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> way

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
half way this is not going all the way

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.070 
half way this is not going all the way
into<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> middle<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:45.160> coming<00:02:45.340> down

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
into the middle this is just coming down

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.980 
into the middle this is just coming down
just<00:02:47.080> about<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.500> far<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:49.360> paper<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.720> not

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
just about that far and the paper is not

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.190 
just about that far and the paper is not
going<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.500> too<00:02:50.680> happy<00:02:50.830> about<00:02:51.040> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
going to be too happy about it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.270 
going to be too happy about it
but<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.500> will<00:02:53.740> still<00:02:53.950> work<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
but this will still work just like that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.270 
but this will still work just like that
now<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.180> flip<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.480> over<00:02:59.010> you'll<00:03:00.010> see

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
now when you flip it over you'll see

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.030 
now when you flip it over you'll see
these<00:03:00.520> four<00:03:00.880> shapes<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.570> these<00:03:02.560> are<00:03:02.770> going<00:03:02.950> to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
these four shapes and these are going to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.300 
these four shapes and these are going to
be<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.310> petals<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> lotus<00:03:05.590> flower<00:03:05.830> now

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
be the petals for the lotus flower now

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.500 
be the petals for the lotus flower now
the<00:03:06.370> step<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.730> we're<00:03:06.880> going<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> do<00:03:07.270> if

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
the step that we're going to do if

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.000 
the step that we're going to do if
you're<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:07.810> careful<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.500> actually<00:03:08.680> rip

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
you're not careful you can actually rip

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.010 
you're not careful you can actually rip
the<00:03:09.190> paper<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.610> try<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.150> careful<00:03:10.900> as

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
the paper so try and be as careful as

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.110 
the paper so try and be as careful as
you<00:03:11.080> can<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.709> we're<00:03:12.520> going<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.820> flip

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you can with this we're going to flip

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.479 
you can with this we're going to flip
them<00:03:13.330> all<00:03:13.620> inside<00:03:14.620> out<00:03:14.890> we're<00:03:15.100> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.280> wrap

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
them all inside out we're going to wrap

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.240 
them all inside out we're going to wrap
them<00:03:15.730> around<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.150> other<00:03:16.330> direction<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
them around the other direction and the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.510 
them around the other direction and the
way<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.580> works<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:20.010> we're<00:03:21.010> going<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> it's

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
way this works is we're going to it's

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.270 
way this works is we're going to it's
helpful<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.970> push<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.750> provide<00:03:23.560> pressure<00:03:23.890> on

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
helpful to push and provide pressure on

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
helpful to push and provide pressure on
these<00:03:25.270> two<00:03:25.600> points<00:03:26.020> right<00:03:26.110> here<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:28.060> try

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
these two points right here as you try

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.470 
these two points right here as you try
to<00:03:28.330> flip<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.750> around<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.290> go<00:03:30.130> ahead<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.970> give

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
to flip it around so go ahead and give

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.590 
to flip it around so go ahead and give
it<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.630> shot<00:03:32.220> we're<00:03:33.220> going<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.519> push<00:03:33.850> on<00:03:34.150> both

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
it a shot we're going to push on both

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.759 
it a shot we're going to push on both
sides<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:37.320> once<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.500> paper<00:03:39.269> comes<00:03:40.269> around

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
sides and once the paper comes around

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.750 
sides and once the paper comes around
you<00:03:41.769> get<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.100> around<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.610> corner<00:03:47.370> it'll<00:03:48.370> turn

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you get it around that corner it'll turn

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.860 
you get it around that corner it'll turn
around<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.810> this

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.280 

just<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.420> can<00:03:57.569> see<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.019> push

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
just like that you can see you can push

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.410 
just like that you can see you can push
in<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.620> little<00:03:58.650> bit<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.250> pull<00:04:00.030> out<00:04:00.180> some<00:04:00.390> of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
in a little bit and pull out some of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.880 
in a little bit and pull out some of
that<00:04:00.540> paper<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:01.080> up<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.349> that's<00:04:01.500> tucked

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
that paper that's up that that's tucked

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.589 
that paper that's up that that's tucked
in<00:04:02.040> under<00:04:02.280> there<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.269> see<00:04:03.450> how<00:04:03.540> that

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
in under there and you see how that

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.229 
in under there and you see how that
comes<00:04:03.959> up<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.379> creates<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:05.239> nice

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
comes up and that creates that nice

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.080 
comes up and that creates that nice
petal<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:06.900> there<00:04:07.700> now<00:04:08.700> there's<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:08.940> couple

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
petal right there now there's a couple

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.930 
petal right there now there's a couple
ways<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:10.110> by<00:04:10.950> rotating

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
ways you can do that just by rotating

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.430 
ways you can do that just by rotating
and<00:04:12.239> pushing<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.930> way<00:04:13.019> through

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
and pushing it all the way through

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.410 
and pushing it all the way through
you<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:13.920> also<00:04:14.099> unfold<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.879> couple<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.299> these

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
you can also unfold a couple of these

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.150 
you can also unfold a couple of these
things<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.500> little<00:04:16.859> bit<00:04:16.979> more

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
things it's a little bit more

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.460 
things it's a little bit more
complicated<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.630> sort<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.930> wrapping<00:04:19.380> it

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
complicated and then sort of wrapping it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.760 
complicated and then sort of wrapping it
around<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:22.669> re<00:04:23.669> maneuvering<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.300> back<00:04:24.770> like

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
around and re maneuvering it back like

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.409 
around and re maneuvering it back like
that<00:04:27.020> whatever<00:04:28.020> works<00:04:28.380> for<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:30.120> try<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
that whatever works for you to try and

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.610 
that whatever works for you to try and
be<00:04:30.479> as<00:04:30.660> careful<00:04:31.050> as<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.260> can<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.470> you

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
be as careful as you can so that you

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.469 
be as careful as you can so that you
don't<00:04:34.949> rip<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.669> paper<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.970> we're<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.360> do

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
don't rip the paper so we're going to do

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.710 
don't rip the paper so we're going to do
that<00:04:39.660> eight<00:04:40.590> times<00:04:40.650> all<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.150> way<00:04:42.270> around<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
that eight times all the way around the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.719 
that eight times all the way around the
model<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.770> pick<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.889> up<00:04:47.039> push<00:04:47.580> it

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
model just like this pick it up push it

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.499 
model just like this pick it up push it
through

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:58.220 

wrap<00:04:52.509> it<00:04:52.690> around

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.220 

sometimes<00:04:59.230> it's<00:04:59.560> too<00:04:59.980> hard<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> try<00:05:00.640> and

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
sometimes it's too hard to try and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.480 
sometimes it's too hard to try and
unfold<00:05:02.230> some<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.650> paper<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.190> sort<00:05:03.400> of

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
unfold some of the paper so you sort of

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.600 
unfold some of the paper so you sort of
have<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:04.740> get<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:05.980> all<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:07.270> flip<00:05:07.570> inside<00:05:07.810> out

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
have to get this all to flip inside out

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.270 
have to get this all to flip inside out
as<00:05:09.610> carefully<00:05:10.330> as<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:10.870> can<00:05:11.140> okay<00:05:11.980> so<00:05:12.040> those

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
as carefully as you can okay so those

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.060 
as carefully as you can okay so those
are<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.520> four<00:05:12.790> to<00:05:13.570> start<00:05:13.840> off<00:05:13.990> with<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.830> then

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
are the four to start off with and then

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.640 
are the four to start off with and then
for<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.340> next<00:05:18.580> set<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.790> four<00:05:19.410> what<00:05:20.410> can<00:05:20.560> be

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
for the next set of four what can be

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.380 
for the next set of four what can be
helpful<00:05:20.920> is<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.220> fold<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.700> in<00:05:21.820> half<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:22.150> little

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
helpful is to fold it in half a little

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.180 
helpful is to fold it in half a little
bit<00:05:22.510> so<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.230> lessen<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.950> amount<00:05:24.040> of

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
bit so that you you lessen the amount of

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.700 
bit so that you you lessen the amount of
stress<00:05:24.610> around<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.900> outside<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.560> when<00:05:26.680> you

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
stress around the outside and when you

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.940 
stress around the outside and when you
do<00:05:26.920> that<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.840> easier<00:05:29.230> to<00:05:29.350> pull<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.770> around

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
do that it's easier to pull it around

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.290 
do that it's easier to pull it around
the<00:05:30.280> top<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:34.000> I'm<00:05:34.060> sort<00:05:34.270> of

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
the top like that so I'm sort of

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.170 
the top like that so I'm sort of
pinching<00:05:34.780> right<00:05:35.020> here<00:05:35.470> in<00:05:35.760> order<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.940> lessen

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
pinching right here in order to lessen

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.720 
pinching right here in order to lessen
the<00:05:37.480> stress<00:05:37.750> for<00:05:38.200> getting<00:05:38.470> this<00:05:38.620> to<00:05:39.460> wrap

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
the stress for getting this to wrap

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.510 
the stress for getting this to wrap
around<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:41.310> turn<00:05:42.310> inside<00:05:42.490> out<00:05:43.980> so<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.190> second

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
around and turn inside out so the second

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.160 
around and turn inside out so the second
set<00:05:45.640> of<00:05:45.760> four<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.000> little<00:05:46.390> bit<00:05:46.510> easier<00:05:46.810> than<00:05:47.080> the

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
set of four a little bit easier than the

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.260 
set of four a little bit easier than the
first<00:05:47.410> set<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.590> four<00:05:50.100> wrap<00:05:51.100> that<00:05:51.340> around<00:05:51.370> and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
first set of four wrap that around and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.450 
first set of four wrap that around and
in<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.570> last<00:05:52.720> step<00:05:53.170> go<00:05:53.530> ahead<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.860> open<00:05:54.310> this

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
in the last step go ahead and open this

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.910 
in the last step go ahead and open this
up<00:05:54.670> on<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.870> bottom<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.410> that'll<00:05:56.590> give<00:05:56.710> you<00:05:56.860> a

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
up on the bottom and that'll give you a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.460 
up on the bottom and that'll give you a
little<00:05:59.920> bit<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.100> some<00:06:00.490> leaves<00:06:00.760> on<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:02.200> bottom

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
little bit of some leaves on the bottom

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.180 
little bit of some leaves on the bottom
and<00:06:02.560> you<00:06:02.620> flip<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:02.890> over<00:06:03.010> and<00:06:04.890> these<00:06:05.890> are<00:06:06.070> all

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
and you flip it over and these are all

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.800 
and you flip it over and these are all
the<00:06:06.310> petals<00:06:06.490> so<00:06:06.790> you<00:06:06.850> can<00:06:07.000> curl<00:06:07.330> them<00:06:07.510> as<00:06:07.660> much

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
the petals so you can curl them as much

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.520 
the petals so you can curl them as much
as<00:06:07.990> you<00:06:08.020> want<00:06:08.320> in<00:06:08.440> any<00:06:08.500> direction<00:06:11.010> but<00:06:12.010> this<00:06:12.250> is

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
as you want in any direction but this is

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.670 
as you want in any direction but this is
the<00:06:14.530> origami<00:06:15.070> lotus<00:06:15.880> flower
