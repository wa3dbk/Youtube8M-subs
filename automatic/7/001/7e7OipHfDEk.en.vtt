00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
to Siliconera so it looks like
unfortunately<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.539> will<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.840> seeing<00:01:58.289> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
unfortunately we will not be seeing that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709 
unfortunately we will not be seeing that
in<00:01:58.619> fantasy<00:01:58.920> 15<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.609> kingdom<00:02:00.090> hearts<00:02:00.359> 3<00:02:00.569> in

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
in fantasy 15 or kingdom hearts 3 in

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.109 
in fantasy 15 or kingdom hearts 3 in
2014<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.710> mean<00:02:01.859> I<00:02:02.069> suppose<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.700> possible<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
2014 I mean I suppose it's possible that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.059 
2014 I mean I suppose it's possible that
we<00:02:03.240> might<00:02:03.539> see<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.829> doesn't

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
we might see them then but it doesn't

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.410 
we might see them then but it doesn't
seem<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.280> likely<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.969> me<00:02:06.090> given<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
seem all that likely to me given that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.279 
seem all that likely to me given that
they<00:02:06.600> were<00:02:06.659> only<00:02:06.960> announced<00:02:08.030> last<00:02:09.030> year<00:02:09.289> now

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
they were only announced last year now

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.980 
they were only announced last year now
we<00:02:10.679> could<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.130> at<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> ass<00:02:11.610> end<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.180> 2014

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
we could see them at the ass end of 2014

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.509 
we could see them at the ass end of 2014
that<00:02:13.200> being<00:02:13.470> sort<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.769> November<00:02:14.370> December

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
that being sort of November December

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.000 
that being sort of November December
kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.209> time<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.080> honest<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.440> doubt<00:02:16.709> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
kind of time but to honest I doubt that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
kind of time but to honest I doubt that
we'll<00:02:17.159> see<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.430> before<00:02:17.760> 2015

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
we'll see it before 2015

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.959 
we'll see it before 2015
do<00:02:19.500> typically<00:02:19.920> take<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.459> little<00:02:20.640> while<00:02:20.849> to

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
do typically take a little while to

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.670 
do typically take a little while to
develop<00:02:21.090> their<00:02:21.510> games<00:02:21.719> especially<00:02:22.110> Kingdom

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
develop their games especially Kingdom

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.750 
develop their games especially Kingdom
Hearts<00:02:22.799> that's<00:02:23.099> literally<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.609> been

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
Hearts that's literally just been

Hearts that's literally just been
announced<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.870> given<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.709> know<00:02:25.859> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
development period for each game I doubt

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.289 
development period for each game I doubt
we'll<00:02:28.409> say<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.739> 2014<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.849> was<00:02:30.150> certainly

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
we'll say it in 2014 but I was certainly

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.240 
we'll say it in 2014 but I was certainly
