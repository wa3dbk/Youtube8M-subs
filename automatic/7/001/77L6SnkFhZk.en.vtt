just get right into it so first you'll
need<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.199> shell<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.700> shell<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:34.460> 1010<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.670> this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
need a shell the shell is 1010 like this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
need a shell the shell is 1010 like this
1<00:00:36.090> 2<00:00:36.120> 3<00:00:36.300> 4<00:00:36.630> 5<00:00:37.320> 6<00:00:37.350> 7<00:00:37.890> 8<00:00:38.430> 9<00:00:38.489> yup<00:00:39.059> 10<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.079> ate<00:00:40.440> up

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 yup 10 and then ate up
here<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> when<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
here and then one in when you get to the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
here and then one in when you get to the
8th<00:00:43.530> block<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
8th block right there so then you just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.369 
8th block right there so then you just
have<00:00:46.579> redstone<00:00:47.579> lamps<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.989> edges<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
have redstone lamps on the edges of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.900 
have redstone lamps on the edges of
these<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> yeah<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.050> set<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
these so yeah then you just set up the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.900 
these so yeah then you just set up the
lovers<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.300> button<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.670> one

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
lovers and button like so you have one

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
lovers and button like so you have one
right<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.620> space<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.190> between

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
right here you have one space in between

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.529 
right here you have one space in between
for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> button<00:01:00.469> where<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.670> corners<00:01:02.670> then

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
for the button where the corners then

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
for the button where the corners then
you<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.260> side<00:01:04.619> by<00:01:04.769> side<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.339> 2

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you have two other side by side a 2

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.350 
you have two other side by side a 2
space<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.840> another<00:01:07.470> lever<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.360> let's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
space and then another lever so let's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
space and then another lever so let's
get<00:01:09.600> into<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> left<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> right

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
get into how to make the left and right

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.420 
get into how to make the left and right
turn<00:01:11.640> signals<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.510> first<00:01:13.500> you're<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
turn signals so first you're going to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.679 
turn signals so first you're going to
need<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.909> redstone<00:01:15.659> dot<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> comparator<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
need a redstone dot and a comparator and

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
need a redstone dot and a comparator and
subtraction<00:01:18.689> mode<00:01:18.950> with<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> clock<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.930> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
subtraction mode with a clock like so so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
subtraction mode with a clock like so so
it<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> redstone<00:01:23.009> clock<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.390> need<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it is a redstone clock then you need to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.999 
it is a redstone clock then you need to
bring<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> Redstone<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.030> then

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
bring the Redstone out like so and then

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
bring the Redstone out like so and then
put<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.869> delay<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.100> 12<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> three<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
put the delay on 12 like on three so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.580 
put the delay on 12 like on three so
then<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.290> need<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
then it is like that and you need to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
then it is like that and you need to
have<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.979> repeater<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.119> else<00:01:39.329> it'll

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have the repeater that for or else it'll

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
have the repeater that for or else it'll
just<00:01:39.960> stay<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> can't<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just stay on and you can't have it on a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
just stay on and you can't have it on a
full<00:01:42.150> tick<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:43.140> that'll<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.710> delay<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
full tick because that'll just delay the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
full tick because that'll just delay the
redstone<00:01:44.850> too<00:01:45.149> much<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> that'll<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.649> keep

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
redstone too much and that'll just keep

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
redstone too much and that'll just keep
it<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:48.689> want

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it on so that's not what you really want

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.160 
it on so that's not what you really want
and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> same<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and then you just do the same with the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.280 
and then you just do the same with the
other<00:01:52.909> side<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:56.960> yeah<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
other side like this and yeah then you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
other side like this and yeah then you
have<00:01:58.500> your<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.259> left<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> your<00:02:03.630> right

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have your have your left and your right

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.139 
have your have your left and your right
turns<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> yeah<00:02:06.680> ok<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.310> guess<00:02:08.550> i<00:02:08.910> should

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
turns so yeah ok so i guess i should

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.750 
turns so yeah ok so i guess i should
also<00:02:09.300> point<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.610> you'll

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
also point out the things that you'll

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.780 
also point out the things that you'll
need<00:02:12.000> you'll<00:02:12.390> need<00:02:12.540> redstone

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
need you'll need redstone

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.839 
need you'll need redstone
still<00:02:14.000> repeater<00:02:14.650> redstone<00:02:15.650> comparator

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
still repeater redstone comparator

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.699

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
buttons and a building block that's all

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.229

you<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.250> need<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.459> guess<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:22.969> should<00:02:23.150> have

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
you that you need I guess I should have

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.550 
you that you need I guess I should have
said<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.569> before<00:02:23.689> but<00:02:23.959> I'm<00:02:24.200> not<00:02:24.349> going<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
said that before but I'm not going to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.099 
said that before but I'm not going to
redo<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.099> so<00:02:25.819> we're<00:02:26.629> going<00:02:26.719> to<00:02:26.840> make<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
redo this so we're going to make the

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.640 
redo this so we're going to make the
horn<00:02:27.349> right<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> what<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.629> need<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:30.049> some

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
horn right now so what you need is some

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
horn right now so what you need is some
i<00:02:31.609> like<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.150> use<00:02:32.209> wood<00:02:32.569> because<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:32.989> slower

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
i like to use wood because it's slower

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.670 
i like to use wood because it's slower
but<00:02:33.799> you<00:02:33.980> need<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.400> type<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.170> block<00:02:36.170> that'll

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
but you need a type of block that'll

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.490 
but you need a type of block that'll
make<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.859> different<00:02:37.310> noise<00:02:37.760> for<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.500> note

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
make a different noise for the note

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.349 
make a different noise for the note
block<00:02:39.739> i<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.159> using<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.790> like<00:02:41.000> i<00:02:41.120> said<00:02:41.389> so

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
block i like using would like i said so

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.140 
block i like using would like i said so
so<00:02:44.359> you<00:02:44.420> need<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.900> sort<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.620> make<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.220> ugly

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
so you need to sort of make it ugly

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.330 
so you need to sort of make it ugly
sounding<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.019> people<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.920> when<00:02:49.159> you're

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
sounding so people know when you're

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.369 
sounding so people know when you're
gonna<00:02:49.459> get<00:02:49.730> hit<00:02:50.030> when<00:02:50.510> they're<00:02:50.720> gonna<00:02:50.870> get<00:02:51.109> hit

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
gonna get hit when they're gonna get hit

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.420 
gonna get hit when they're gonna get hit
I<00:02:51.590> don't<00:02:52.459> know<00:02:52.579> I<00:02:52.730> guess<00:02:52.879> yeah<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:55.010> that's<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
I don't know I guess yeah so that's the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.580 
I don't know I guess yeah so that's the
button<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.000> really<00:02:56.510> simple<00:02:56.840> all<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.349> need

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
button it's really simple all you need

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.539 
button it's really simple all you need
is<00:02:57.739> registered<00:02:58.310> odd<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.819> then<00:02:59.260> to<00:03:00.549> note

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
is registered odd and then to note

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.309 
is registered odd and then to note
blocks<00:03:01.849> making<00:03:02.389> a<00:03:02.919> really<00:03:03.919> gross<00:03:04.400> sound<00:03:05.319> okay

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
blocks making a really gross sound okay

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.140 
blocks making a really gross sound okay
so<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.889> next<00:03:06.919> thing<00:03:07.250> I'm<00:03:07.519> going<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.819> show<00:03:07.909> you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
so the next thing I'm going to show you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.869 
so the next thing I'm going to show you
is<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.569> hazard<00:03:09.470> lights<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.189> what<00:03:10.760> you're

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
is the hazard lights so what you're

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.670 
is the hazard lights so what you're
going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> need<00:03:11.209> for<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.930> redstone

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
going to need for this is a redstone

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.390 
going to need for this is a redstone
trail<00:03:13.159> going<00:03:14.000> underground<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:16.040> two<00:03:16.370> three

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
trail going underground one two three

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.819 
trail going underground one two three
blocks<00:03:17.090> steep<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:17.989> walk<00:03:18.169> around<00:03:18.530> in

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
blocks steep so you can walk around in

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.909 
blocks steep so you can walk around in
it<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.090> can<00:03:20.269> bring<00:03:20.479> that<00:03:20.690> down<00:03:20.959> then<00:03:21.769> you

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
it so you can bring that down then you

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.920 
it so you can bring that down then you
need<00:03:22.099> enough<00:03:22.459> room<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.269> make<00:03:23.419> another

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
need enough room to make another

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.559 
need enough room to make another
redstone<00:03:24.409> clock<00:03:24.859> with<00:03:25.159> a<00:03:25.190> comparator<00:03:25.819> like<00:03:26.209> so

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
redstone clock with a comparator like so

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.589 
redstone clock with a comparator like so
it's<00:03:26.919> just<00:03:27.919> I<00:03:28.220> use<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.909> comparator<00:03:29.359> because

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
it's just I use the comparator because

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.610 
it's just I use the comparator because
it's<00:03:29.979> really<00:03:30.979> compact<00:03:31.669> so<00:03:32.569> then<00:03:33.229> you<00:03:33.379> just

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
it's really compact so then you just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.830 
it's really compact so then you just
need<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.949> bring<00:03:34.159> it<00:03:34.280> up<00:03:34.400> like<00:03:34.609> this<00:03:34.819> make<00:03:35.810> a

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
need to bring it up like this make a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.800 
need to bring it up like this make a
little<00:03:36.260> wine<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.859> that<00:03:37.129> so<00:03:37.879> it<00:03:38.060> looks<00:03:38.720> like

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
little wine like that so it looks like

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.710 
little wine like that so it looks like
this<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.379> then<00:03:39.470> with<00:03:39.919> a<00:03:39.949> delay<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:40.639> so<00:03:41.239> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
this and then with a delay like so and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.110 
this and then with a delay like so and
then<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.290> bring<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.620> up<00:03:43.150> with<00:03:44.150> another<00:03:45.099> delay

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
then you bring it up with another delay

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.969 
then you bring it up with another delay
so<00:03:47.120> yeah<00:03:47.810> that's<00:03:47.959> pretty<00:03:48.139> simple<00:03:48.769> all<00:03:48.859> you

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
so yeah that's pretty simple all you

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.939 
so yeah that's pretty simple all you
need<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.310> do<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.639> go<00:03:49.819> underground<00:03:50.060> if<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:51.260> guess

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
need to do is go underground if I guess

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.830 
need to do is go underground if I guess
it<00:03:52.129> even<00:03:52.729> though<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.000> simple<00:03:53.569> it's

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
it even though it is simple it's

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.599 
it even though it is simple it's
probably<00:03:54.169> the<00:03:54.650> hardest<00:03:55.099> because<00:03:55.220> he<00:03:55.459> actually

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
probably the hardest because he actually

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.909 
probably the hardest because he actually
got<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.209> go<00:03:56.299> underground<00:03:56.569> because<00:03:57.409> I<00:03:57.620> couldn't

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
got to go underground because I couldn't

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.099 
got to go underground because I couldn't
fit<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.280> anywhere<00:03:58.760> else<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.299> didn't<00:03:59.900> want<00:04:00.019> to

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
fit it anywhere else I didn't want to

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.990 
fit it anywhere else I didn't want to
make<00:04:00.199> it<00:04:00.379> go<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:00.979> because<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:01.729> didn't<00:04:01.970> want

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
make it go up so because I didn't want

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.619 
make it go up so because I didn't want
to<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.389> like<00:04:02.659> a<00:04:02.959> huge<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:04.419> thing<00:04:05.419> right

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
to have like a huge like thing right

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.009 
to have like a huge like thing right
there<00:04:06.500> blocking<00:04:07.310> your<00:04:07.639> vision<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.389> that's<00:04:08.810> why

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
there blocking your vision so that's why

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.080 
there blocking your vision so that's why
I<00:04:09.049> put<00:04:09.229> it<00:04:09.349> underground<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.340> once<00:04:10.639> again<00:04:10.759> you

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
I put it underground so once again you

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.909 
I put it underground so once again you
need<00:04:11.479> to<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.959> three<00:04:12.199> blocks<00:04:12.439> steep<00:04:12.739> so

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
need to have it three blocks steep so

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.429 
need to have it three blocks steep so
you<00:04:13.009> can<00:04:13.129> walk<00:04:13.310> around<00:04:13.609> then<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.439> redstone

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
you can walk around then a redstone

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.990 
you can walk around then a redstone
clock<00:04:15.739> like<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:17.419> then<00:04:17.539> repeater<00:04:18.500> and

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
clock like this and then repeater and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.330 
clock like this and then repeater and
repeater<00:04:20.000> going<00:04:20.659> into<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.989> sides<00:04:21.229> so<00:04:21.560> i'll

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
repeater going into the sides so i'll

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.570 
repeater going into the sides so i'll
just<00:04:22.370> show<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.680> actually<00:04:24.860> does<00:04:25.340> work

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
just show you that it actually does work

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.700 
just show you that it actually does work
both<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.539> them<00:04:26.659> are<00:04:26.810> blinking

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
both of them are blinking

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.080 
both of them are blinking
and<00:04:28.310> yeah<00:04:28.780> okay<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.139> finally<00:04:31.039> we<00:04:31.639> have<00:04:31.850> these

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
and yeah okay so finally we have these

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.770 
and yeah okay so finally we have these
snoops<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:33.259> have<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.680> stop<00:04:34.009> sign<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.819> what<00:04:35.690> you

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
snoops we have the stop sign so what you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.170 
snoops we have the stop sign so what you
need<00:04:35.930> for<00:04:36.139> this<00:04:36.319> is<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.830> need<00:04:37.009> two<00:04:37.580> repeaters

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
need for this is you need two repeaters

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.390 
need for this is you need two repeaters
so<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.050> red<00:04:39.169> stone<00:04:39.440> doesn't<00:04:39.650> get<00:04:39.860> tangled<00:04:40.039> up

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
so the red stone doesn't get tangled up

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.510 
so the red stone doesn't get tangled up
so<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.680> doesn't<00:04:42.800> get<00:04:43.069> tangled<00:04:43.250> up

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
so it just so it doesn't get tangled up

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.150 
so it just so it doesn't get tangled up
so<00:04:44.150> then<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.810> just<00:04:45.050> need<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.319> redstone<00:04:45.680> trail

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
so then you just need a redstone trail

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.620 
so then you just need a redstone trail
connecting<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:48.789> that's<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:50.090> it's

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
connecting that and that's it it's

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.680 
connecting that and that's it it's
really<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.830> simple<00:04:51.860> it's<00:04:52.699> quite<00:04:53.449> simple

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
really that simple it's quite simple

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.040 
really that simple it's quite simple
because<00:04:54.229> it<00:04:54.949> can<00:04:55.160> do<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.520> because<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
because it can do that because the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.909 
because it can do that because the
repeater<00:04:57.380> won't<00:04:57.710> work<00:04:57.919> when<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:59.330> that

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
repeater won't work when it's like that

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.580 
repeater won't work when it's like that
so<00:05:00.919> yeah<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:01.610> just<00:05:02.139> that's<00:05:03.139> how<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.410> make

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
so yeah that's just that's how you make

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.820 
so yeah that's just that's how you make
the<00:05:03.770> stop<00:05:04.009> lights<00:05:05.380> probably<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.530> second

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
the stop lights probably the second

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.100 
the stop lights probably the second
simplest<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:07.550> yeah<00:05:08.090> we've<00:05:08.449> just<00:05:08.840> made

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
simplest so yeah we've just made

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.290 
simplest so yeah we've just made
ourselves<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:11.590> had<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.250> headlight<00:05:14.060> system

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
ourselves I had like a headlight system

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.990 
ourselves I had like a headlight system
I<00:05:14.570> guess<00:05:14.690> you<00:05:14.840> could<00:05:14.870> say<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.139> you<00:05:15.380> could<00:05:16.000> you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
I guess you could say so you could you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.499 
I guess you could say so you could you
could<00:05:17.210> surround<00:05:18.169> this<00:05:19.060> like<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.210> can<00:05:20.360> make<00:05:20.479> a

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
could surround this like you can make a

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.930 
could surround this like you can make a
hood<00:05:20.900> for<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.620> that's<00:05:21.889> what<00:05:22.039> I<00:05:22.070> did<00:05:22.430> all<00:05:22.729> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
hood for this that's what I did all the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.230 
hood for this that's what I did all the
red<00:05:23.060> stone<00:05:23.360> is<00:05:23.539> in<00:05:23.690> there<00:05:23.930> OOP<00:05:24.909> break<00:05:25.909> anything

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
red stone is in there OOP break anything

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.089 
red stone is in there OOP break anything
nope<00:05:26.840> there's<00:05:27.139> your<00:05:27.349> spats<00:05:28.750> that's<00:05:29.750> not<00:05:29.930> good

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
nope there's your spats that's not good

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.740 
nope there's your spats that's not good
but<00:05:31.099> yeah<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:31.759> you<00:05:31.849> can<00:05:31.970> just<00:05:32.000> make<00:05:32.389> a<00:05:32.419> hood

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
but yeah so you can just make a hood

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.930 
but yeah so you can just make a hood
like<00:05:32.780> I<00:05:33.080> said<00:05:33.320> make<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.650> car<00:05:34.039> make<00:05:34.699> some

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
like I said make a car make some

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.589 
like I said make a car make some
passengers<00:05:35.360> seeds<00:05:35.840> may<00:05:36.169> be<00:05:36.229> a<00:05:36.530> trunk<00:05:37.130> and

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
passengers seeds may be a trunk and

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.510 
passengers seeds may be a trunk and
that's<00:05:38.599> it<00:05:38.870> it's<00:05:39.050> really<00:05:39.409> simple<00:05:39.710> that's<00:05:40.250> all

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
that's it it's really simple that's all

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.560 
that's it it's really simple that's all
it<00:05:40.550> there<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.449> it<00:05:41.630> I'll<00:05:41.840> just<00:05:43.090> nope<00:05:46.570> I'll
