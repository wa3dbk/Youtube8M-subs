I<00:03:25.110> believe<00:03:25.769> rim<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:27.450> takes<00:03:27.660> two<00:03:27.930> slots

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
I believe rim this takes two slots

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
I believe rim this takes two slots
instead<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.860> one<00:03:29.120> which<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.269> little

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
instead of one which is a little

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.250 
instead of one which is a little
different<00:03:30.810> than<00:03:30.930> my<00:03:31.080> nvidia<00:03:32.360> geforce<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.690> i'll

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
different than my nvidia geforce so i'll

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.570

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.179 

you<00:06:43.330> guys<00:06:43.509> see<00:06:43.629> them<00:06:43.779> never<00:06:43.960> match<00:06:44.229> up<00:06:44.259> there

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189 
you guys see them never match up there

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:49.350 
you guys see them never match up there
we<00:06:45.279> go<00:06:47.309> all<00:06:48.309> right<00:06:48.430> there<00:06:48.909> we<00:06:48.939> go<00:06:49.089> we<00:06:49.210> gotta

we go all right there we go we gotta

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.320 
we go all right there we go we gotta
then<00:06:49.979> now<00:06:52.229> the<00:06:53.229> power<00:06:53.909> cables<00:06:54.909> for<00:06:55.029> it's<00:06:55.149> right

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
then now the power cables for it's right

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.799 
then now the power cables for it's right
in<00:06:55.479> there<00:06:56.099> believe<00:06:57.099> it's<00:07:00.809> basically

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:01.809
