00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
footwork settled in the pocket that was

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.029 
footwork settled in the pocket that was
probably<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.800> priority<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:24.740> last<00:00:25.740> week's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.410> could<00:00:31.529> say<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> want

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
I think you could say it all you want

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
I think you could say it all you want
they<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.329> decide<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.110> want<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.440> do

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
they have to decide that they want to do

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.290 
they have to decide that they want to do
it<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> thought<00:00:35.100> he<00:00:35.160> decided<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.850> week<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it I thought he decided this week that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.850 
it I thought he decided this week that
he<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.899> work<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
he was going to really work on that and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.060 
he was going to really work on that and
we<00:00:38.399> made<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.760> progress<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.890> why<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we made some progress but why is that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.650 
we made some progress but why is that
such<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> mean<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.059> seems<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> common

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
such a mean that seems to be a common

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
such a mean that seems to be a common
problem<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.649> young<00:00:43.950> quarterback<00:00:44.430> yeah

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
problem on all young quarterback yeah

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
problem on all young quarterback yeah
why<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.059> difficult<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.629> calm<00:00:45.899> calm

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
why is that so difficult it calm calm

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.220 
why is that so difficult it calm calm
calm<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> lot<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> different

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
calm you know there's a lot of different

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
calm you know there's a lot of different
reasons<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.670> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
reasons I think one is that not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
reasons I think one is that not
recognizing<00:00:51.870> what's<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> front<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
recognizing what's going on up front and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
recognizing what's going on up front and
that<00:00:53.340> were<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:54.000> something<00:00:54.390> picked

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that were actually got something picked

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
that were actually got something picked
up<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.140> doesn't<00:00:55.710> look<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.340> picked<00:00:56.579> up

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
up and doesn't look like it's picked up

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
up and doesn't look like it's picked up
you<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.390> trusting<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.350> understanding

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you know just trusting and understanding

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.270 
you know just trusting and understanding
all<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> blocking<00:01:00.059> schemes<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.039> are<00:01:02.039> going

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
all the blocking schemes that are going

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.260 
all the blocking schemes that are going
on<00:01:03.290> just<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.489> experience<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
on just that I think just experience and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
on just that I think just experience and
confidence<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
confidence that you know it's going to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
confidence that you know it's going to
open<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.570> bad<00:01:10.320> trying<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> break

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
open up for you or bad trying to break

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.740 
open up for you or bad trying to break
bad<00:01:11.430> habits<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.420> were<00:01:12.450> younger

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
bad habits from when they were younger

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
bad habits from when they were younger
yeah<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.790> something

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
yeah I think probably that has something

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
yeah I think probably that has something
to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.259> he<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.820> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to do with the two because he was you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.800 
to do with the two because he was you

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
know they were running you know a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
know they were running you know a
protection<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.140> everybody<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.770> sank<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
protection where everybody just sank and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
protection where everybody just sank and
he<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.640> dropped<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.420> found<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> other

NFL he's he's questionable for saturday
but<00:02:47.600> i<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:48.860> after<00:02:49.100> after<00:02:49.850> today<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.570> feel

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
but i think after after today we feel

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.360 
but i think after after today we feel
like<00:02:51.080> we're<00:02:51.650> going<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.830> put<00:02:51.950> him<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.160> plane

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
like we're going to put him on the plane

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.060 
like we're going to put him on the plane
because<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:53.570> need<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.860> he's<00:02:54.950> going

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
because if we need to I think he's going

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.680 
because if we need to I think he's going
to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.220> able<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.489> play<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.670> for<00:02:55.730> us<00:02:55.910> relative<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.490 
to be able to play it for us relative to
our<00:02:56.840> sicknesses<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.530> think<00:02:57.790> we're<00:02:58.790> much<00:02:59.269> better

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
