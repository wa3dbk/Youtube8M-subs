00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.340

 long time 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.289
 improve 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.439
 what this work that began to develop 40 years ago 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.249

 But Kaakah, I'm not going to enter. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.830
 but let's talk about the plastic arts 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.600
 you had spoken there in the dutra until you started painting the most 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.570
 usually when the artist has an early career he has a 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.120
 inspiration and some artist who wants to motivate you and who inspired you 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.959
 early career 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 Good thing it's diosdith, my child. 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.959
 1 I think I was born with this name 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.759
 and more 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.779
 My friend, I also like the same month life. 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 things like you do not remember vacation time to us 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 he wrote him / p with him 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 and I did not stop 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.719
 how I had to work hard and not 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.199
 had positive 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.529
 and then 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.669
 because woman 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.669
 and learn a lot with your business owner 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.579
 What do you sometimes spend there in my studio? 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:02.409
 I was trying to be talked about exposed to a peek at her job and such 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.749
 sometimes this actually occurred 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.839
 enough 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.379
 but in the times that your work is differentiated are works of style 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.789
 baroque I was older own was not people realize that you do not trust 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.849
 in nobody that you have a style of your own it gives a very hard kick 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:19.949
 interesting 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.799
 I do not know with the FC Porto. 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.139
 the president of telcomp lara 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.139
 but how to explain exactly why this club 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.789
 no senate 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.929
 it's in the blood is not 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.779
 so I'm talking here with rock and the defendant 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.889
 he is an artist who has never done solo exposure ever made 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.199
 collective exhibition he is not even a catalog he was not in any 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.989
 book but one thing we are absolutely sure he is in the heart of the people 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.749
 of the round-broad capon that is important he is an artist who is 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.499
 in a neighborhood of the outskirts lives in a very beautiful city comments about the mountain 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:58.980
 As you can see 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.320
 here and we are showing you some pictures of your house 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.539
 and some jobs he performs that even in his home 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.559
 while the others are passing we're going to stay here 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:15.089
 I want to leave a big hug for the tension that you have given and do not lose 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.799
