this<00:00:15.210> tutorial<00:00:15.360> I'm<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> show<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.109> how

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
this tutorial I'm going to show you how

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:16.320> use<00:00:16.379> audibles<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.090> an

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
to use audibles to get into an

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.310 
to use audibles to get into an
advantageous<00:00:18.810> position<00:00:23.960> okay<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
advantageous position okay so in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.109 
advantageous position okay so in the
previous<00:00:25.439> two<00:00:25.769> tutorials<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.550> learned<00:00:26.760> what

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
previous two tutorials you learned what

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
previous two tutorials you learned what
and<00:00:27.300> how<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.289> audibles<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.070> also<00:00:29.250> learn

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and how to use audibles you also learn

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
and how to use audibles you also learn
that<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.789> should<00:00:29.939> check<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.210> formation

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that you should check your formation

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
that you should check your formation
audibles<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.250> sure<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> don't<00:00:32.759> overlap

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
audibles to be sure you don't overlap

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.569 
audibles to be sure you don't overlap
the<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:33.480> plays<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.890> bring<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the two plays to bring you back up to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.040 
the two plays to bring you back up to
speed<00:00:35.670> i<00:00:35.820> showed<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
speed i showed you how to get to the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.590 
speed i showed you how to get to the
plate<00:00:37.260> Texas<00:00:37.829> without<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:39.090> directly

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
plate Texas without going there directly

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
plate Texas without going there directly
we<00:00:40.290> audible<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> new<00:00:41.129> play<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.579> new

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
we audible to a new play in a new

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
we audible to a new play in a new
formation<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.719> use<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> deep<00:00:43.469> past

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
formation and then use the deep past

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250 
formation and then use the deep past
audible<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> formation<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
audible from that formation to get to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
audible from that formation to get to
the<00:00:46.379> play<00:00:46.530> Texas<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.850> means<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.510> can

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the play Texas this means that we can

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
the play Texas this means that we can
use<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.079> Y<00:00:49.320> spot<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> different<00:00:50.430> formation

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
use the Y spot for a different formation

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
use the Y spot for a different formation
all<00:00:50.910> together<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.079> asking<00:00:52.199> what

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
all together so you're asking what

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
all together so you're asking what
should<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.550> well<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> great

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
should we put their well that's a great

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
should we put their well that's a great
question<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.170> best<00:00:55.440> man<00:00:55.680> players<00:00:56.010> aren't

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
question the best man players aren't

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.430 
question the best man players aren't
playing<00:00:56.640> football<00:00:57.210> they're<00:00:57.870> playing<00:00:58.050> chess

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
playing football they're playing chess

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
playing football they're playing chess
and<00:00:58.649> battling<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.250> mentally<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.969> another

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and battling it out mentally on another

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
and battling it out mentally on another
level<00:01:00.449> perhaps<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> read<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> article<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
level perhaps you read that article that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.969 
level perhaps you read that article that
I<00:01:02.340> had<00:01:02.399> written<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.420> VG<00:01:03.780> blog<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.860> I'm

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
I had written on the VG blog what I'm

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.530 
I had written on the VG blog what I'm
saying<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> everything<00:01:06.270> should<00:01:06.299> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
saying here is that everything should be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
saying here is that everything should be
systematic<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.130> should<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
systematic to you there should be a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.789 
systematic to you there should be a
right<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> reason<00:01:09.450> why<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> called<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
right and a reason why you called the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.399 
right and a reason why you called the
play<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> did<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:12.750> let<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.110> give<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
play that you did but let me give you a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
play that you did but let me give you a
demonstration<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.250> goes<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
demonstration of what goes into a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
demonstration of what goes into a
typical<00:01:15.240> mind<00:01:15.479> game<00:01:15.720> between<00:01:15.869> two<00:01:16.350> elite<00:01:16.680> mad

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009

and<00:01:20.939> run<00:01:21.060> heavy<00:01:21.270> formation<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.020> our<00:01:22.200> fart<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and run heavy formation like our fart I

twins our opponent sees this and decides
he's<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> audible<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> run-heavy

he's going to audible into a run-heavy
formation<00:01:27.780> such<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> 46<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
formation such as the 46 well we want to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
formation such as the 46 well we want to
run<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> ball<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.890> perhaps<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> eat<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.850> some

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
run the ball here perhaps to eat up some

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
management tutorial here however we

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
management tutorial here however we
don't<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> run<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> against<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> 46

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
don't want to run it against the 46

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.819 
don't want to run it against the 46
formation<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.659> our<00:01:39.810> y<00:01:40.079> audible<00:01:40.619> here

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
formation so we use our y audible here

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.280 
formation so we use our y audible here
to<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.400> into<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> new<00:01:41.970> formation<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.659> shotgun<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
to go into a new formation a shotgun a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.190 
to go into a new formation a shotgun a
passing<00:01:44.009> play<00:01:44.220> our<00:01:44.520> opponent<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.420> sees<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
passing play our opponent now sees this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.359 
passing play our opponent now sees this
and<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:47.340> audibles<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> passing<00:01:48.780> defense

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
and he audibles up to a passing defense

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
and he audibles up to a passing defense
perhaps<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> quarter<00:01:51.360> package<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
perhaps it's the quarter package you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
perhaps it's the quarter package you
know<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.890> got<00:01:53.040> us<00:01:53.189> again<00:01:53.490> he's<00:01:53.670> shown<00:01:53.909> he

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
know I he got us again he's shown he
