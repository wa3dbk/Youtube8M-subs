 nobody comes in at all, we are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.759

 a look behind the turner backdrops 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.310
 throw 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 Hello Fabian 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.810
 Wow 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.550
 hello , we may ask a question 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.740
 bit of gain brought with 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.630
 five gymnasts from ktv straubenhardt and 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.590
 I know at the gym with a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.810
 cozy burst that the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.290
 Schnitzelgrube and for that ok and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 Here we go 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.700
 fabian with questions holes 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.470
 now comes the first training of 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.370
 who have seen as a child is like that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.890
 a training not insane 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
 exhausting yes of course at the beginning 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.710
 Do not do that so you're still relative 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.960
 fit but at the end when you're at home 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.120
 and that was really flat 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.340
 We saw the trainer doing this 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 the case is your dad know that when 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.820
 your father is training that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.520
 somehow great or sometimes really stupid 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.160
 yes of course you will be fucked harder 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.510
 that's very clear and sometimes it does 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.130
 disadvantages because the stress is not one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.840
 hall views at home next money 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.280
 that has many advantages of the city nothing 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.270
 must organize that he has everything and everything 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.710
 training only on training 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.290
 can focus and what's up 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.680
 normal normal day at you like 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.300
 it is such a super tor to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.620
 great because I have good ones of course once 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.480
 Gene from my father because he himself 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.060
 then I stressed at five already 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.190
 started and then already 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 hard training every day and my day 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.310
 perfect new school in the morning 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.430
 and then listen to workout on 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.670
 the most important force is somehow müli 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.370
 or rolls bread or disco it comes 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 probably not in it or yes 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.520
 sometimes I would be a bit 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.720
 go away in the evening or something like that 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.610
 i can get out on saturday evening sometimes 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
 if I have Sundays free but 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.430
 otherwise it does not bother me 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.140
 You've been here for three hours now 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.630
 in the hall and trains what trains 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.730
 because just like her the sequence yes me 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.140
 start with an hour of gymnastics and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.120
 a bit of weight training and then 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.700
 usually everything on the devices so 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.970
 see through competition then present 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.860
 want 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.200
 that he's already with his 17 years 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.790
 you achieved a great deal 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.739
 Olympic Games in Athens with you 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.600
 had been on the reck until seventh 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.130
 eighth in the team ranking and short 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.640
 on it up to double World Cup winner 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.830
 become 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.680
 what are your biggest success for you? 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.630
 yes of course in Athens the seventh 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.010
 place in detail but with the 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.799
 Team Eighth Place was natural 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.419
 something very big in front of us because that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.729
 long gone were achieved 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.650
 is and we did not want ours 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.720
 aim to become eighth if it succeeds 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.669
 and the rest was then additionally the stop 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.430
 but athen is natural 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.169
 nature conservation presses at home 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.360
 are funny nicknames namely smaller 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.390
 pig dog and here namely the people 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.710
 professor, how come there is no idea 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.450
 I think little pig will mine 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.400
 father invented times or so when we look 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.810
 have stressed again but why 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.000
 Professor Ewald because of my glasses 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 Back then that was just emergency because I was 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.810
 contact lenses because the broken 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.680
 are and the people are very nice 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.330
 By the way, still in the eleventh grade 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.040
 you do not just have a high school diploma 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.940

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.660
 only for the competitions 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.580

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.350

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.970
 I think I want to study where soft 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.560

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.530

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:49.990
 Do you have leisure time besides the sound? 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.129
