00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 well friends came monday and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 finally we can figure it out for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.529
 those who were interested in what 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 happens to a dj when he 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.889
 getting on this slippery and very 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.300
 interesting way today we are 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.009
 sure to find out today at a party 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 Sergey Fadeev the same DJ frame 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.210
 taught us from which we performed so 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 a lot of time at the consoles we turn to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.279
 questions that are of great interest 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 tell us the number of people of the earring 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 how much do you need to do to at least 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 somehow start performing in clubs with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 with their sets or know with anything 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.100
 standard course DJing two or three 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.450
 two or three weeks you can already 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.059
 you can already get up at the console boldly 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 Well if you somehow from the right hand there 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.160
 places grow then you can try but 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 The main thing that you were given is possible if 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 you have no acquaintances and you just 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 come some club you need 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 do in order for you to be given 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.289
 play the principle most tereshkova 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.289
 by city represents only 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.370
 opportunity at the end of courses 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 speak in Kobe let's say no one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 final exams 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
 if not to take into account these schools 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.170
 DJing how can you learn and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.430
 break into this business in the long run 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 yourself enough just to get 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.900
 some minimal set sake through to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.590
 equipment to study house 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:21.200
 play ourselves or two we someone 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 in principle, the minimum theory is already possible 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.670
 how many dj is starting to earn here 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.720
 that's how they just started average well 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 when already digi 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 more or less able to express themselves 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.950
 already fought something and level ji link 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.100
 who are there at all industrial snowballs 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.140
 stage 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 probably jane when is the initial when 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.560
 keep playing either for free or for 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.579
 someone a symbolic amount even so 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.850
 say on the road or on 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.150
 on food well, here is the second one, then something in the area 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.740
 clearly 1002 per hour 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.450
 falling in love and the third floor in general probably 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.950
 Russian level when jane 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.060
 the original such scale goes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.070
 federal bring them to places in 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.810
 other cities they are not because 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 that they are friends are friends because they are 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.340
 know this of course the fees 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:24.989
 already there i 'm afraid not to speak but i heard 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.989
 about amounts of 150,000 such are now in the city 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.340
 maybe his pair of characters 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.739
 Does this profession decide such a thing? 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 how arrogance and image creation that is 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.040
 you look great and you start 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.280
 affix say I'm a battle with you 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.989
 nothing that I'm a star and 110 litter for an hour 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.799
 if you made yourself some of them 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.200
 certain bear you really 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.910
 takes place on our stage give life to 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.530
 if you perceive the flattery of the boat 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.120
 that in principle you have the right to come 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.530

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.010
 some may be their own circles in their 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.200
