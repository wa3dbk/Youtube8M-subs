sort of old-school style of gameplay
where<00:01:04.000> you're<00:01:04.119> just<00:01:04.269> kind<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.479> running<00:01:04.690> around

however a nostalgic gameplay isn't
really<00:01:09.009> enough<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.369> salvage<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.910> whole

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
frustrating game that just isn't a whole

frustrating game that just isn't a whole
lot<00:01:13.899> of<00:01:14.170> fun<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.920> most<00:01:15.550> Mega<00:01:15.789> Man<00:01:16.000> fans<00:01:16.300> will

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
whole point of the game is that you're

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.580 
whole point of the game is that you're
going<00:01:21.310> through<00:01:21.460> stages<00:01:22.119> shooting<00:01:23.050> up<00:01:23.140> robots

well<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.159> vision<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.520> extra<00:01:57.790> characters

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
well the vision of the extra characters

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.609 
well the vision of the extra characters
is<00:01:58.299> nice<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.659> everything<00:01:58.719> what<00:01:59.320> basically

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
is nice and everything what basically

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.020 
is nice and everything what basically
boils<00:01:59.979> down<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.759> game<00:02:00.909> just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
boils down to is that the game just

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.670 
boils down to is that the game just
isn't<00:02:01.329> a<00:02:01.360> whole<00:02:01.540> lot<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.869> fun<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.170> play<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
isn't a whole lot of fun to play and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080 
isn't a whole lot of fun to play and
that's<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> big<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.250> part<00:02:03.460> because<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.820> level

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090

designs the whole thing requires a whole
lot<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.189> memorization<00:02:06.430> on<00:02:06.820> your<00:02:06.969> part<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
lot of memorization on your part you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.580 
lot of memorization on your part you
kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.689> go<00:02:07.810> through<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.320> die

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
kind of have to go through and just die

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.229 
kind of have to go through and just die
a<00:02:08.619> whole<00:02:09.100> lot<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.340> time<00:02:09.579> figuring<00:02:09.910> out<00:02:10.090> where

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
a whole lot of time figuring out where

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.090 
a whole lot of time figuring out where
all<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.539> 1<00:02:10.720> kill<00:02:10.929> spike<00:02:11.230> pits<00:02:11.500> are

all the 1 kill spike pits are
this<00:02:13.700> wouldn't<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.510> bad<00:02:14.720> except<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
this wouldn't be so bad except for the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960 
this wouldn't be so bad except for the
fact<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:15.980> difficulty<00:02:16.520> levels<00:02:16.820> in<00:02:16.880> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
fact that all difficulty levels in the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.090 
fact that all difficulty levels in the
game<00:02:17.120> apart<00:02:17.570> from<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> easiest<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:19.070> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
game apart from the easiest have a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
game apart from the easiest have a
basically<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.940> limited<00:02:20.330> continued<00:02:20.720> system<00:02:21.110> so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
basically a limited continued system so

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.890 
basically a limited continued system so
you<00:02:21.740> only<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.040> many<00:02:22.220> retry<00:02:22.970> chips<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you only get so many retry chips as the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.360 
you only get so many retry chips as the
game<00:02:24.050> calls<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.710> while<00:02:25.190> there<00:02:25.340> are

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
game calls it and while there are

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
game calls it and while there are
checkpoints<00:02:25.790> while<00:02:26.270> you're<00:02:26.390> playing<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:27.020> you

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
checkpoints while you're playing if you

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.470 
checkpoints while you're playing if you
lose<00:02:27.500> all<00:02:27.740> those<00:02:27.890> retried<00:02:28.400> shifts<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:29.240> got<00:02:29.390> to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
lose all those retried shifts you got to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.820 
lose all those retried shifts you got to
start<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.750> whole<00:02:29.900> level<00:02:30.200> over<00:02:30.410> again<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
start the whole level over again and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.920 
start the whole level over again and
that's<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.310> painful<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.510> comment<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
that's just painful the comment in the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.120 
that's just painful the comment in the
game<00:02:33.050> also<00:02:33.200> isn't<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.740> all<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:33.950> great

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
game also isn't really all that great

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.890 
game also isn't really all that great
despite<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> fact<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.150> all<00:02:35.360> three<00:02:35.390> playable

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
despite the fact that all three playable

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.150 
despite the fact that all three playable
characters<00:02:36.260> are<00:02:36.410> sort<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.890> their<00:02:37.040> own

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
characters are sort of have their own

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.620 
characters are sort of have their own
new<00:02:37.370> weapons<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.820> they<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.180> earn<00:02:38.270> if<00:02:38.510> they

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
new weapons that they can earn if they

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.290 
new weapons that they can earn if they
go<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.740> their<00:02:39.890> different<00:02:40.130> abilities

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
go and have their different abilities

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
go and have their different abilities
it's<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.690> there<00:02:41.930> isn't<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> whole<00:02:42.290> lot

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
it's just that there isn't a whole lot

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.660 
it's just that there isn't a whole lot
to<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.950> know<00:02:43.040> even<00:02:43.280> though<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.490> have

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
to it you know even though they have

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.740 
to it you know even though they have
these<00:02:43.790> different<00:02:44.090> weapons<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.420> don't<00:02:44.570> really

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
these different weapons you don't really

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.050 
these different weapons you don't really
use<00:02:45.440> them<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.740> whole<00:02:46.010> lot<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.700> most<00:02:46.850> part

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
use them a whole lot for the most part

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.820 
use them a whole lot for the most part
their<00:02:47.270> standard<00:02:47.600> blasters<00:02:48.080> are<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.620> enough

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
their standard blasters are just enough

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
their standard blasters are just enough
to<00:02:48.920> get<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> job<00:02:49.370> done<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.210> extra

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
to get the job done and the extra

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.700 
to get the job done and the extra
weapons<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.870> know<00:02:50.960> while<00:02:51.140> some<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.440> them<00:02:51.560> do

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
weapons you know while some of them do

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.920 
weapons you know while some of them do
more<00:02:51.890> damage<00:02:52.070> than<00:02:52.370> others<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:53.510> don't<00:02:53.720> feel

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
more damage than others just don't feel

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.990 
more damage than others just don't feel
all<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:54.110> necessary<00:02:54.770> there<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.790> couple

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
all that necessary there are a couple

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.580 
all that necessary there are a couple
little<00:02:56.300> things<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.780> combat<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.140> are<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
little things in the combat that are a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.630 
little things in the combat that are a
little<00:02:57.800> bit<00:02:57.950> different<00:02:58.220> like<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.340> there's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
little bit different like that there's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.060 
little bit different like that there's
special<00:02:59.030> combo<00:02:59.540> attack<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.990> can<00:03:00.170> use<00:03:00.890> with

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
special combo attack you can use with

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.560 
special combo attack you can use with
both<00:03:01.250> characters<00:03:01.760> by<00:03:01.910> filling<00:03:02.210> up<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.360> meter

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
both characters by filling up the meter

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.780 
both characters by filling up the meter
as<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.900> play<00:03:03.110> when<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.860> time<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.370> right<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
as you play when you time this right and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.100 
as you play when you time this right and
you<00:03:04.880> press<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.270> r2<00:03:05.510> button<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.870> do<00:03:05.990> this

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
you press the r2 button to do this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.600 
you press the r2 button to do this
attack<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.650> sort<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:06.860> goes<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.190> crazy

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
attack it sort of goes in this crazy

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.340 
attack it sort of goes in this crazy
cutscene<00:03:08.390> where<00:03:08.630> you're<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.320> a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
cutscene where you're like all of a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.750 
cutscene where you're like all of a
sudden<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.710> this<00:03:09.890> plane<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.190> looks<00:03:10.610> like

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
sudden on this plane that looks like

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.670 
sudden on this plane that looks like
it's<00:03:10.910> inside<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.450> matrix<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.320> you're

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
it's inside the matrix and then you're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.950 
it's inside the matrix and then you're
both<00:03:12.890> shooting<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.550> guy<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.090> then<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.600> robot

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
both shooting the guy and then the robot

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.290 
both shooting the guy and then the robot
takes<00:03:15.440> some<00:03:15.590> damage<00:03:15.710> or<00:03:16.040> something<00:03:16.190> neat<00:03:16.970> idea

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
takes some damage or something neat idea

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.640 
takes some damage or something neat idea
but<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.810> isn't<00:03:17.990> really<00:03:18.170> all<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.260> effective

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
but it isn't really all that effective

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.770 
but it isn't really all that effective
an<00:03:18.950> attack<00:03:19.250> most<00:03:19.640> time<00:03:19.940> say<00:03:20.300> for<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.510> couple<00:03:20.750> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
an attack most time say for a couple of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.870 
an attack most time say for a couple of
specific<00:03:20.990> enemies<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.220> don't<00:03:22.670> know<00:03:22.730> it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
specific enemies and I don't know it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.950 
specific enemies and I don't know it
just<00:03:22.910> doesn't<00:03:23.240> look<00:03:23.270> all<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.660> great

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
just doesn't look all that great

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.750

even<00:03:47.170> worse<00:03:47.320> though<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.860> combat

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
even worse though is that the combat

even worse though is that the combat
with<00:03:48.610> during<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.880> boss<00:03:49.000> battles<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.390> also

isn't<00:03:50.050> very<00:03:50.350> good<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.680> patterns<00:03:51.040> are<00:03:51.190> still

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520

isn't very good the patterns are still
super<00:03:51.730> rudimentary<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.510> figure<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:52.960> and<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
super rudimentary to figure out and the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.500 
super rudimentary to figure out and the
only<00:03:53.800> challenge<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.550> fact<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
only challenge is the fact that that the

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.060 
only challenge is the fact that that the
bosses<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:56.020> deal<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> fair<00:03:56.560> amount<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.860> damage

bosses do deal a fair amount of damage

well<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:57.880> great<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.120> everything<00:03:58.180> that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
well it's great and everything that's

old games that style is also kind of

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.140
