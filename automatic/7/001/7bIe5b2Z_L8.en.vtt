start<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.390> same<00:01:12.659> size<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
start are not the same size okay you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
don't want them to all end at the same

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
don't want them to all end at the same
time<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> strip<00:01:18.720> ends<00:01:18.990> we're

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
time because when a strip ends we're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
time because when a strip ends we're
going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> add<00:01:19.770> another<00:01:20.159> piece<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
going to add another piece to it and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.140 
going to add another piece to it and
they'll<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> bulky<00:01:22.590> section<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.729> we'll<00:01:23.970> be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
they'll be a bulky section so we'll be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.560 
they'll be a bulky section so we'll be
adding<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.720> piece<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.119> it'll<00:01:27.479> be

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
adding a piece like this and so it'll be

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.770 
adding a piece like this and so it'll be
doubled<00:01:28.080> over<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.340> while<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
doubled over for a little while and so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
doubled over for a little while and so
it'll<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> real<00:01:31.350> bulky<00:01:31.799> section<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.670> you

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it'll be a real bulky section so you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.390 
it'll be a real bulky section so you
don't<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.450> three<00:01:33.900> strips<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.920> end<00:01:35.130> at

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
don't want all three strips to end at
the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:35.759> point<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.900> we'll<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the same point and then we'll have one

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.249 
the same point and then we'll have one
big<00:01:37.740> huge<00:01:38.070> bulky<00:01:38.549> section<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.689> them<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
big huge bulky section you want them to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.639 
big huge bulky section you want them to
