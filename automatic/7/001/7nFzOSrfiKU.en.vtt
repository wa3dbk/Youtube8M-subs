00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.600 
yes not the reason why I don't play xbox
is<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.390> people<00:02:11.720> will<00:02:11.840> play<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:13.070> it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
is the people will play it because it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.780 
is the people will play it because it
just<00:02:13.700> doesn't<00:02:14.000> interest<00:02:14.270> me<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.780> more<00:02:15.790> planet

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
just doesn't interest me on more planet

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.420 
just doesn't interest me on more planet
for<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> long<00:02:17.000> time<00:02:17.330> right<00:02:17.540> now<00:02:17.570> but<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.020> know

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
for a long time right now but you know

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.760 
for a long time right now but you know
so<00:02:19.570> yeah<00:02:20.570> I'll<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.810> top<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.170> our<00:02:21.230> place<00:02:21.440> my<00:02:21.710> own

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
so yeah I'll do top of our place my own

personal channel I probably might be

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.220
