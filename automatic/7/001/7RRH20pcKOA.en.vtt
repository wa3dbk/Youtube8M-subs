 ways

 path of evolution is the very course which 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 assumed to be four 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:38.700

 bow before your souls 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 before your consciousness before your 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 systems systems man was 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 telling on multiple is 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.200
 unique and what is manifested physical 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 reality is a small part of what we 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:31.740
 call that is a human system 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:38.150
 when you fancy incarnate 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 teachers or when you remember jesus 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:49.829
 do you remember exactly physical 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:55.619
 his physical form is physical like him 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:02:01.820
 could somehow look the outlines of his body 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:06.869
 but unfortunately you have no opportunity 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.790
 understand who he was, what kind of structure 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.250
 what is this system and very few and walls 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.210
 before 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:23.470
 what exactly or what kind of job 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:28.290
 this structure performed we say it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 in order to draw an analogy between 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:40.500
 an ordinary person who does not see himself 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.450
 of that enormous potential of that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:52.480
 uniqueness and day after day it passes 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:57.310
 incarnation but he is not taken out for anything 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 here what he needs to do like him 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.700
 you need to behave and most importantly how 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.550
 need to perceive everything that happens 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:13.560
 both inside it and 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:18.010
 space around its value 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.420
 human systems is his 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.840
 the inner world is more than a table like him 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.750
 perceives himself in the surrounding 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.090
 space itself surrounding 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.890
 space and your inner world is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.980
 great sense of auto and big difference 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.030
 meanwhile in perception 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.040
 his inner world and what he 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.329
 there really is 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.350
 at the moment man is very 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:04.560
 hard to understand who he really is 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:10.320
 but we want to offer several workers 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:14.270
 practice options as well as information 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:20.080
 threads in order 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:26.980
 to give a person touched to 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:30.820
 what is he really on this 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:38.350
 tutor on this first tutor 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 steps will be rendered or shown 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:47.180
 the uniqueness of the human system 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:53.720
 maybe it sounds somewhat simple 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:57.820
 because you can say yes i am 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.180
 I know what a person is even the most 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.730
 developed and advanced in esoterica 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.260
 representatives of humanity can 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:14.390
 put everything into details and about it 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:19.100
 much information is written for our purpose 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:25.360
 occupation is precisely the feeling of oneâ€™s 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:31.600
 uniqueness and from here the consciousness will be in 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:34.450
 outside the sun your feelings that 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.520
 line up at soul level 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.140
 accept and transform this 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.840
 information into consideration in your language in 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.520
 which will be the main point 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:54.920
 self-awareness as part of the part creator 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.290
 the creator is hard to understand 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:04.900
 difficult but you can feel it 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:11.050
 exactly when the structure works together 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:16.030
 christ consciousness and strangle man on 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:22.330
 classes will also be given practice 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.330
 which will give 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.270
 the tutor 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:40.740
 to man 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:40.740
 attention is not only its essence but also 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:58.949
 attention to what is 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:07:07.569
 the creator and in fact even if you believe the creator 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:13.949
 you don't understand what it is 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:17.860
 developed to the maximum feelings you 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.419
 spend in a certain space or 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.690
 in a certain layer 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:28.150
 where in meditation you can 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:32.430
 feel what creators are 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:35.789
 such being part creator it means 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.789
 understand you
