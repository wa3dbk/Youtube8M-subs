00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.120
 hello to all what 35 minutes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.640
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.590
 new video of these 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.820
 of the hour and you've been very 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.380
 many to ask me what are the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.269
 chad that I used for opening 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.090
 pike so I chose you from 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.640
 present one is the swing a pacs of 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.849
 Quebec in its 4 inch version then 4 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.650
 inches it corresponds to 10 cm is a 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.690
 chad which is rather filiform rather long 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.470
 to his ends with the chorale is a small 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.960
 no barrier 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.040
 he is relatively discreet and at the same time 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360
 time he has a task that is very 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.710
 dynamic so he's actually going to you 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.070
 allow fishing for both 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.680
 active fish that fearful fish 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.329
 the two montages with which with 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.100
 which in fact I use so this is the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.539
 texan luscious while they get married 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.879
 very well to texans there it is a small 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.370
 leaded heads texan ilex clogs you 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.309
 can also use it with a texan 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.899
 all simple and a ball lead and if not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.160
 I use with a leaded lead so there 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.050
 it's a little berkeley leaded head 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 2.7 g 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.600
 at the level of other montages and ben 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.360
 it's a check we'll be able to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.130
 use android shot on a quote or 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 even on a rebel orbey cetto spin 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.670
 finally it's a good trailer 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 it is still very flexible and enough 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.360
 fragile therefore will have to pay attention by 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.009
 example when you take pike 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 because usually the gold can 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.509
 to be damaged quickly enough is small 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.799
 disadvantage at the level of colors then 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.570
 I chose to discolour anyway 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.189
 very natural who was talking to me about fishing in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630
 done in all conditions and 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.479
 especially that allow me to take 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 pike when he's creative so the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.979
 first color cu al that nothing beige 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.000
 this is it is that the king casa guy 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.500
 senate a color that works very well 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.899
 to persuade them so I have some 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.450
 very good feedback from friends on the zander 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.979
 and after the pole also you have very good 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.329
 on it then as it's a color that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.310
 is very neutral and at the same time that is 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.710
 pretty clairvoyant saw that he's a Belgian 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.909
 clear enough that tends to the orange we have 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.280
 tendency to take a lot of 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.469
 pike with is it this second color 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.759
 so that's the blue jeans flash then 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.959
 it's a color that works pretty well 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.220
 on the way actually it's enough 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.230
 amazing but I took a lot of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.870
 cholet nex the color and then if not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 classically perch and pike 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.209
 more sport is that it's okay 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.350
 allow in fact to also take aim 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.090
 fish of good size than 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 small fish as seen by 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.770
 example rent the lure can easily 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.270
 to turn on itself 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.460
 and so a perch a little perch 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.500
 can easily grab the here it is 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.580
 so in fact it allows you to fish at 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.230
 pretty much in any condition 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.880
 on any fish 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.180
 from the moment you choose 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.170
 colors natural enough and so bah 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.670
 that's all for the little presentation 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.500
 the lure now we will go into 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.320
 basin to see how it works because 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.470
 that it's really nice, it's 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470
 left
