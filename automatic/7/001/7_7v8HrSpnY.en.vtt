 roberto trumpeter and director of the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 clear grouping that yes we are with 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.479
 them and today we are going to know more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 its recent record material 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.840
 100 the old good and because the idea of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.090
 asia in the old so they tell me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.640
 the boys 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 because if as we know is hitting 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.789
 very fashionable the corridos and well we want 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 give you a sample of the risks of being 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.200
 hot the history of our 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 occupation about two years ago 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.250
 and a half 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.729
 we have already been working on this in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.619
 this nice art and good the proposal is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.850
 we bring a musical proposal this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850
 original a style of its own 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.520
 the idea can boost youth as 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.670
 they will realize the comfort grouping 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 is made up of this one by 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.140
 Boys boys with lots of energy 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.800
 eager to get ahead and this 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.360
 that has been the main idea we give ourselves 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.880
 It also tells that this 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.290
 material for pure unreleased themes 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.710
 how did the idea of ​​making a disc come up 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.840
 completely unpublished because I think that a 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.360
 many many groups and I think that that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.850
 is a to this as a goal that of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.010
 suddenly we propose to do something 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.060
 new to do something original I go back to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.220
 repeat and this and in this case this one 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.380
 we focus mainly on the personal 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.350
 I focused a lot on finding unpublished subjects 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.390
 because then also the same must be given to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.390
 know the talents what are the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.030
 composers of the region the disk if you 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 realize they are composers of Kim of the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.310
 hot land region and this and they are 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 unpublished themes totally unpublished with 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.960
 original arrangements of samples we are going to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.310
 see who is the most chosen 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.360
 for being more strawberry to see who they say the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.360
 more strawberry element of the band to see 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.450
 they point to there and here to see who 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.489
 He says 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.080
 to see everyone choose why I feel sorry 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.900
 the most strawberry chau that feels to be 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 strawberry compadre is not so wrong 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.280
 because it does not offer us anything 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.090
 well what happens that is a bit 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.650
 nervous or let's understand why the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.970
 cameras impose microphone also good 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.800
 now goes to 100 the old man is not a 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.239
 video clip they just made and for 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.440
 Certainly he has had quite a few visits 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.750
 we invite you to check it through 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.069
 facebook through youtube that we 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.750
 You can talk through this video and 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.170
 made precisely in this space 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.890
 near here because if this that was 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.030
 the intention to record something from here this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.390
 record it right here in tejupilco 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.819

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.350
