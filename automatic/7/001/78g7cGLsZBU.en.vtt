00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 What's up kids today I want to bring you a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.480
 tutorial on how to use the new 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.510
 multimedia player that they have added to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.219
 playstation 4 I just saw it today 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
 Myself was here in download 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.639
 automatically on screen I have not had 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.980
 than to look for it with nowhere so 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.920
 everything to fix has been pending for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 being able to download it is free and for 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.119
 use it what we have to do is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.260
 in a very simple way and before 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 nothing then we are going to take a pendrive 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 storage system and we're going to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.420
 create a folder like the one you see in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 uppercase screen called ps4 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 someone once we make this folder 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 inside this folder then we are going to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 re-create two folders also in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 capital one a music call and another 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 call video where within music me 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 we have our favorite music inside 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.180
 of videos we will put our series of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.940
 movies or whatever we want 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.129
 once we have the folder created 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.230
 the two folders created on the pendrive 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.329
 with our our music in our 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.619
 video we are going to introduce the pendrive in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.090
 the console let's proceed to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 continuation 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.880
 remember that you have to squeeze 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.860
 in the background because many pendrive 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.170
 they do not enter at all and we do not believe that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.000
 they work and that is to the bottom 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.100
 well then once we have the will have 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 introduced is that it has been a very 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.540
 simple the application starts we're going to 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.080
 wait a little 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.760
 the law here as you see already marks me the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.440
 generic more electoral again that is 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.870
 the pen drive and it also marks me the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 Windows Media Player PC I now 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.400
 same this time what I have 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.140
 put the password key so that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.290
 I can access voucher from the computer 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 and so we're going to focus on the usb 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.360
 what would this be that you are seeing here 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.580
 bake we already have the ps4 folder that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.210
 we had created and inside we have music and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.000
 videos 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.190
 let's try for example music 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.080
 well he tells me that you are not there 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.940
 Content that can be played 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.580
 because I think the music was not in 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.790
 mp3 I can not assure you but as 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 we watch videos and we can play videos 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.130
 you come from here perfectly 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.950
 to give it back behind put in the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.450
 I work also here you put emotions 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.810
 in illusions 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.120
 it would be table pizza and we have like 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.090
 miniature views 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.850
 the information or information of each 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.020
 movie of each video 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.020
 I like it more in front 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.890
 benlysta 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.990
 and nothing yesterday is that simple 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.150
 just put in the movie inside 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.000
 of the folder called video inside the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.290
 folder called ps4 and nothing else like that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.969
 simple can we 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
 we can see our content 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.150
 the projection four buoys 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.329
 but also it called rather less 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.099
 so no longer worth far video 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.299
 explanatory tutorial quite simple 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.069
 as you have seen and I hope that what 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.049
 enjoy that I give them life comentÃ©is de 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.239
 share with friends so that all 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.239
 know it and nothing but a goodbye goodbye
