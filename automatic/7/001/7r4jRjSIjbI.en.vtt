 we're going to need lemon let's 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.300
 need beer of your preference 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 we're going to need maggi sauce 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.440
 we are going to need chamoy 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.409
 well let's start these are all 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.969
 the ingredients 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.450
 let's put here in a little bottle in the 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.569
 we need to make a mix we're going to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.109
 put a little bit of a spoonful of chamoy 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.109
 powdered 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.390
 let's make a pasta here we're going to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.220
 mix until we have a kind 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.740
 of pasta 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 it does not have much science is something very 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 simple 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.280
 we were a little thick we added for 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:08.460
 that we get thicker 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.460
 I think that with that is enough 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.990
 with this is enough we will need 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.640
 also a jar or what you 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.080
 prefer 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 we put this mixture and put it up 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.849
 the bottom in the trovas 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.980
 because to the bottom because when you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.650
 let's incorporate the beer this is going to go up 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.260
 and it will mix perfectly or stay 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.550
 down and as they take it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.120
 with the little you are grabbing this mixture 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.340
 let's put I'm also going to put two 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.760
 to begin with if we see that you need more 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.069
 I put more in the end let's squeeze 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.069
 a full lemon 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.280
 If you see that your lemon is very small, 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.030
 they put two and they see that it is very big 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.720
 they put half a lemon is already 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.210
 to eye to calculate we are going to put a 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.260
 pinch of salt of grain preference 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.890
 let's also incorporate 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.780
 a few asp gummies and things and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.060
 point 4 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.270
 If you prefer, you can download the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.590
 glass with the same chamoy powder to me 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.260
 I do not like it because I'm going to take it 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.230
 with straw then then frosty 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 it would serve me little truth 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.140
 and we are going to incorporate now if our 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.960
 beer 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.480
 will be foam first by the 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.360
 inclination of the glass and in second because 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.980
 has salt and lemon and that makes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.980
 react our beers 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 as I was saying this is a drink 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.930
 suitable for women because they 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.060
 like 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.900
 Those who like to drink like it better 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 a sweet drink that a salty drink 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.959
 like a cake 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.959
 but good to be like is to start 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.480
 measurements so that it is done 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.600

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.630
 to your partner to your wife to your girlfriend 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.530
 and basically it would be all and nothing 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.530
 more is to mix 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.930

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.300

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.699

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:49.230
