takes<00:00:36.870> roughly<00:00:37.110> 10<00:00:37.559> days<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.399> Microsoft<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
takes roughly 10 days for Microsoft and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
takes roughly 10 days for Microsoft and
somewhere<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> same<00:00:39.750> bullpup<00:00:40.079> sony<00:00:40.379> and

somewhere in the same bullpup sony and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
somewhere in the same bullpup sony and
then<00:00:41.040> once<00:00:41.160> they're<00:00:41.280> both<00:00:41.460> done<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
then once they're both done they can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
then once they're both done they can
then<00:00:42.600> release<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> update<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.920> both

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
then release the update the both

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
then release the update the both
platforms<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:45.000> day<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:46.320> how

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
platforms on the same day and that's how

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.750 
platforms on the same day and that's how
that's<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> work<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that's going to work so basically this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's going to work so basically this
tweet<00:00:48.000> ashley<00:00:48.329> gives<00:00:48.510> us<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.020> good

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
tweet ashley gives us a really good

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
tweet ashley gives us a really good
estimate<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.100> pilot<00:00:50.579> 14<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.390> coming

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
estimate of when pilot 14 will be coming

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.700 
estimate of when pilot 14 will be coming
out<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.020> wondering<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.410> works

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
out if you're wondering how that works

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
out if you're wondering how that works
and<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.489> said<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> gonna

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and it's because they said it's gonna

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
and it's because they said it's gonna
take<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.149> few<00:00:54.180> weeks<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.440> sooo<00:00:55.590> much

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
take a few weeks so if we just sooo much

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.680 
take a few weeks so if we just sooo much
mean<00:00:55.920> anywhere<00:00:56.190> from<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.489> 22<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.329> free

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
mean anywhere from like 22 like free

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
mean anywhere from like 22 like free
perhaps<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.410> tiny<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.070> birds<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.579> know

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
perhaps a tiny bit more birds you know

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
perhaps a tiny bit more birds you know
unlikely<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.719> they've<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.440> probably

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
unlikely because they've now probably

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.090 
unlikely because they've now probably
announced<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:03.110> basically<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.799> say<00:01:04.949> two

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
announced it basically if we say two

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.649 
announced it basically if we say two
three<00:01:05.309> weeks<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.210> somewhere

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
three weeks from now that's somewhere

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
three weeks from now that's somewhere
around<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.200> 10th<00:01:07.640> subunit<00:01:08.640> maybe<00:01:08.820> even<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
around the 10th subunit maybe even the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.350 
around the 10th subunit maybe even the
15th<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.320> march<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> add<00:01:11.820> 10<00:01:12.180> days

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
15th of march and then you add 10 days

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
15th of march and then you add 10 days
for<00:01:12.750> certification<00:01:13.140> testing<00:01:13.850> sometimes<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
little bit more sometimes a little bit

little bit more sometimes a little bit
less<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.650> could<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.920> anywhere<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
less it could be anywhere from like the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
less it could be anywhere from like the
temp<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.500> 25th<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
temp to like you know what 25th to the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
30th of march certainly attempt to 52

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
30th of march certainly attempt to 52
like<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> 25th<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> 13th<00:01:24.479> march<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.979> i

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
like the 25th to the 13th march so if i

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
like the 25th to the 13th march so if i
had<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> give<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> reliable<00:01:27.570> prediction

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
had to give you a reliable prediction

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
this is pretty exciting because it means

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.510 
this is pretty exciting because it means
they're<00:02:27.900> doing<00:02:28.110> something<00:02:28.440> xbox<00:02:29.100> exclusive

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
they're doing something xbox exclusive

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.680 
they're doing something xbox exclusive
which<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.730> guess<00:02:29.880> isn't<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.209> great<00:02:30.360> percent

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
which I guess isn't that great percent

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.660 
which I guess isn't that great percent
of<00:02:30.750> people<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.770> based<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> fact<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
of people but based on the fact the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.370 
of people but based on the fact the
Microsoft<00:02:33.209> their<00:02:33.420> big<00:02:33.600> push<00:02:33.810> recently<00:02:34.200> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
Microsoft their big push recently is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
Microsoft their big push recently is
their<00:02:34.650> cloud<00:02:34.890> servers<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.550> that's<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:35.910> they

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
their cloud servers like that's how they

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.720 
their cloud servers like that's how they
think<00:02:36.239> they<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.540> bridge<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.780> gap<00:02:37.250> /<00:02:38.250> Sony<00:02:38.459> is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
think they can bridge the gap / Sony is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.670 
think they can bridge the gap / Sony is
I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.810> might<00:02:39.989> be<00:02:40.050> something<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> have

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
I think it might be something to have

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.309 
I think it might be something to have
service<00:02:41.100> coming<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.610> um<00:02:41.959> perhaps<00:02:42.959> they'll

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
service coming so um perhaps they'll

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.750 
service coming so um perhaps they'll
have<00:02:43.470> public<00:02:43.830> service<00:02:44.160> where<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.459> play
