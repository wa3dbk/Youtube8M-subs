the charger port but anyways they have
very<00:01:09.659> similar<00:01:10.070> processor<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.490> 1.2<00:01:12.500> 1.4<00:01:13.500> ok

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
very similar processor but 1.2 1.4 ok

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
very similar processor but 1.2 1.4 ok
which<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> has<00:01:15.030> better<00:01:15.299> processor<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.200> gig<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
which it has better processor one gig of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.090 
which it has better processor one gig of
ram<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.770> both<00:01:17.990> ok<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.049> let<00:01:19.470> me<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
ram for both ok so let me just get the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
ram for both ok so let me just get the
to<00:01:20.310> form<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> turned<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> same<00:01:22.290> time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
to form to be turned on at the same time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.160 
to form to be turned on at the same time
we'll<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we'll see which one it's going to be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.420 
we'll see which one it's going to be
faster

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940

forms

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
forms

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
forms
faster<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> two<00:01:43.800> phone

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
faster or not just to get the two phone

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
faster or not just to get the two phone
we<00:01:44.400> turn<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.730> off<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.330> get<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.660> turned<00:01:45.900> on

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
we turn it off and you get it turned on

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.340 
we turn it off and you get it turned on
that's<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.790> our<00:01:48.350> good

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that's not gonna be in like our good

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820 
that's not gonna be in like our good
magic<00:01:50.190> because<00:01:50.970> maybe<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.990> point<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.560> from

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
magic because maybe this point like from

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.580 
magic because maybe this point like from
LG<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:53.730> have<00:01:53.910> more<00:01:54.120> applications<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.290> that's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
LG they have more applications so that's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.790 
LG they have more applications so that's
gonna<00:01:55.800> take<00:01:55.920> some<00:01:56.160> times<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.060> reload<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.200> but

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
gonna take some times to reload it but

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.760 
gonna take some times to reload it but
anyways<00:01:59.550> performs<00:02:00.360> great<00:02:00.540> phones<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.230> faster

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
anyways performs great phones and faster

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.680 
anyways performs great phones and faster
phones<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.400> also<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.330> things<00:02:03.570> about
