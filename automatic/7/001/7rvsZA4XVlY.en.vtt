00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
pretty new and they aren't getting a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.600 
pretty new and they aren't getting a
little<00:00:12.150> um<00:00:12.620> broken<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.340> want<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
little um broken in and I want to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
little um broken in and I want to
preserve<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.870> are<00:00:15.990> broken<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> so

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
preserve that how they are broken in so

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.640 
preserve that how they are broken in so
I'm<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.039> some<00:00:17.190> shellac<00:00:17.430> spray<00:00:18.650> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I'm going to use some shellac spray the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.990 
I'm going to use some shellac spray the
one<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.990> bull's<00:00:21.990> eye<00:00:22.850> kind<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
one that I have is bull's eye kind of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.890 
one that I have is bull's eye kind of
thing<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> goes<00:00:25.039> right<00:00:26.039> into<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.330> specific

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thing so it goes right into a specific

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
thing so it goes right into a specific
spot<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:29.340> why<00:00:29.519> I'm<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.760> using

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
spot and that's why I'm not using

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.130 
spot and that's why I'm not using
anything<00:00:30.359> under<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
anything under it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.760 
anything under it
this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> safer<00:00:32.340> than<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> UM<00:00:33.559> liquid<00:00:34.559> ones

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this is safer than the UM liquid ones

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
this is safer than the UM liquid ones
and<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.579> has<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.000> clear<00:00:36.270> too<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.780> no

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and it has it's clear too and it has no

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.830 
and it has it's clear too and it has no
color<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> take<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:38.910> I'm

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
color so I'm going to take about I'm

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
color so I'm going to take about I'm
going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> take<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> flaps<00:00:40.590> away<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
going to take the flaps away from I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.880 
going to take the flaps away from I
point<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.350> separate<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> make<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
point you and separate them to make it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.520 
point you and separate them to make it
easier<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> spray<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.289> precise<00:00:48.530> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
easier to spray it has really precise so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950 
easier to spray it has really precise so
it's<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it's pretty good so then I'm going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's pretty good so then I'm going to
shake<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.370> cap<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:55.489> spray<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.520> on

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
shake it and then on cap it spray it on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.720 
shake it and then on cap it spray it on

put<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.220> top<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.329> right

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
put it on top so that's the same right

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
put it on top so that's the same right
there<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.020> normally<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.439> come<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:49.710> like
