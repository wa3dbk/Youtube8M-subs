00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
what they look like generally speaking

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.800 
what they look like generally speaking
they're<00:02:10.489> gonna<00:02:10.610> fit<00:02:10.880> exactly<00:02:11.390> like<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> first

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
they're gonna fit exactly like the first

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.280 
they're gonna fit exactly like the first
ones<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.410> those<00:02:12.680> clear<00:02:13.310> stands<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.840> guess<00:02:15.170> I'll

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
ones in those clear stands I guess I'll

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.100 
ones in those clear stands I guess I'll
just<00:02:15.319> open<00:02:15.590> one<00:02:15.920> very<00:02:16.160> quickly<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.989> show<00:02:18.020> you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.449 

use<00:02:24.110> my<00:02:24.560> power<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.330> safety<00:02:26.690> scissors<00:02:27.459> to

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
use my power of the safety scissors to

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.890 
use my power of the safety scissors to
cut<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.760> open<00:02:28.970> they<00:02:29.269> always<00:02:29.510> come<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
cut this open they always come in the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.190 
cut this open they always come in the
separate<00:02:30.290> compartments<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.540> guess<00:02:32.569> if<00:02:32.930> they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
separate compartments I guess if they

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.870 
separate compartments I guess if they
start<00:02:33.470> making<00:02:33.620> bootlegs<00:02:34.220> they<00:02:34.580> might<00:02:34.760> be

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
start making bootlegs they might be

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.050 
start making bootlegs they might be
different<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:37.160> plastic<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.730> always<00:02:37.910> gonna

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
different so the plastic is always gonna

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.539 
different so the plastic is always gonna
have<00:02:38.269> its<00:02:38.420> compartments<00:02:38.930> with<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.140> different

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
have its compartments with the different

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
was like this because these are replicas

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.720 
was like this because these are replicas
of<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.599> Bandai<00:02:50.900> toys<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.560> they're<00:02:52.430> gonna<00:02:52.519> make

version comes filled with sand the one

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.440 
version comes filled with sand the one
that<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.710> got<00:04:33.950> is<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.370> Hong<00:04:34.580> Kong<00:04:34.610> version<00:04:35.300> by

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
that I got is the Hong Kong version by

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.520 
that I got is the Hong Kong version by
the<00:04:35.480> way<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.720> didn't<00:04:35.960> get<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.169> Japanese

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
sparkles I'm not sure but that seems to

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:49.900 
sparkles I'm not sure but that seems to
be<00:06:48.410> a<00:06:48.500> difference<00:06:48.860> between<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.220> Japanese<00:06:49.699> and

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
be a difference between the Japanese and

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.960 
be a difference between the Japanese and
the<00:06:49.940> Hong<00:06:50.120> Kong<00:06:50.150> version<00:06:51.160> so<00:06:52.160> yeah<00:06:52.699> they're

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
the Hong Kong version so yeah they're

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.150 
the Hong Kong version so yeah they're
pretty<00:06:53.180> cool<00:06:53.949> from<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:54.979> back<00:06:55.960> they're<00:06:56.960> not

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
pretty cool from the back they're not

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.680 
pretty cool from the back they're not
too<00:06:58.160> detailed<00:06:59.259> but<00:07:00.259> they<00:07:00.409> do<00:07:00.470> have<00:07:01.479> like<00:07:02.479> this

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
too detailed but they do have like this

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.600 
too detailed but they do have like this
one<00:07:02.810> has<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:03.110> gold<00:07:03.319> finish<00:07:03.680> on<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.949> back<00:07:04.220> and

the<00:07:04.669> shiny<00:07:04.940> red<00:07:05.270> part<00:07:05.830> so<00:07:06.830> pretty<00:07:07.400> much<00:07:07.610> three

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
the shiny red part so pretty much three

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.800

dimensionally they are pretty complete

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.920 
dimensionally they are pretty complete
there's<00:07:12.590> a<00:07:12.680> couple<00:07:12.830> differences<00:07:13.810> from<00:07:14.810> the

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
there's a couple differences from the

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.270 
there's a couple differences from the
originals<00:07:15.470> like<00:07:15.590> I'm<00:07:15.680> pretty<00:07:15.830> sure<00:07:16.099> the

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
originals like I'm pretty sure the

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.020 
originals like I'm pretty sure the
original<00:07:16.639> doesn't<00:07:16.909> have<00:07:17.680> this<00:07:18.680> oh<00:07:19.310> no<00:07:19.819> those

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
original doesn't have this oh no those

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.580 
original doesn't have this oh no those

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
know I had to look up pictures of the

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.249 
know I had to look up pictures of the
original<00:07:23.330> cuz<00:07:23.449> I<00:07:23.539> never<00:07:23.630> had<00:07:23.840> it<00:07:23.990> for<00:07:24.169> the

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259 
original cuz I never had it for the

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.249 
original cuz I never had it for the
reasons<00:07:24.560> that<00:07:24.620> I<00:07:24.680> mentioned<00:07:25.009> before<00:07:25.900> and<00:07:26.900> this

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 
reasons that I mentioned before and this

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.570 
reasons that I mentioned before and this
one<00:07:28.419> the<00:07:29.419> buttons<00:07:29.810> when<00:07:30.319> I<00:07:30.349> was<00:07:31.220> putting<00:07:31.490> this

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.060 
one the buttons when I was putting this
together<00:07:31.729> I<00:07:32.180> tried<00:07:32.780> pushing<00:07:33.020> the<00:07:33.229> buttons<00:07:33.530> and

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.409 
together I tried pushing the buttons and
just<00:07:34.340> really<00:07:34.550> wanted<00:07:34.789> to<00:07:34.849> push<00:07:35.030> the<00:07:35.150> buttons

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650 
but they didn't do anything obviously

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.219
