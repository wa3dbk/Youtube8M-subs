00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.490
 that's the one on Friday that made it possible 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.800
 the more objective to hire extras join visitors for that 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.329
 Procedure experiment 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 the widower delivered German plastic box 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 Photo Rolex very important 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.759
 this is how he looks like 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.480
 pretty massive 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.249
 well processed 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.640
 Iran would be deposed in blue Novoflex part 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 the possibility is there on the camera can 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250
 The blind is the same for Porto Focus lenses 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.960
 the as well 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 the situation in the mid-double low course 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.620
 and I do not want that now 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 Join Frank Koch at 1 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.760
 So it's a good idea to get a Formula 1 friend from Hugh Hefner as that objectively 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 connects the two together 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.770
 but here to simply wait the mark over set thanks 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.760
 André 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820
 who creates the office also here is no going off 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.180
 which is meant to suppress ligamentous strain 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.660
 and that objectively, they do not just dump everyone in that direction 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 the treetops towards the camera body 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 Pressing a photo slightly presses then just this fear again 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 unscrew as employment 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 the lure great for how this works with Neymar in this picture 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 as you can see 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 So you can love this block very nice and very short 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.490
 crisp intelligibility still has a mark here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.440
 make a dash on the way and Hanna Jansen or Jerome large circle Borken 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.310
 Relief small circle for the closed turn 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.450
 And the whole thing can be really stepless here just a piece of fabric 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 you can live it just fine 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.040
 To understand the favor of the privately private is then easy here 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 that is really minimal that is also immersing in a team 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.890
 this closed aperture exposure weekend this is really too of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859
 Passers centimeters maybe 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.559
 notified 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.789
 The possibility of course is a danger dar so the camera 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.839
 and «Next» 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.069
 passing over the mark 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 Inquiry with and found in Walldorf dapd 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.129
 the whole thing is on 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.530
 and you already have Celeste small western riding with even image quality 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.549
 whatever the audience is uninteresting 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.719
 With the Schoenberg open to anyone because if you want to do for example 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.219
 that is so Dr 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.209
 November for the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.179
 Nicholas in Kiel 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.909
 for the first at the 11th
