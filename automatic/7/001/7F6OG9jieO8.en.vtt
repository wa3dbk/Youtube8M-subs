00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
down a repeater like so as you can see

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.000 
down a repeater like so as you can see
when<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.079> happens<00:00:40.320> it'll<00:00:40.469> knock<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> off

timer so once that five minutes is up
whenever<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.850> block<00:00:53.850> deletes<00:00:54.449> itself<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
whenever the block deletes itself it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.240 
whenever the block deletes itself it
will<00:00:55.440> resend<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.370> current<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.510> call<00:00:57.840> stone

guess<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.369> say<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.780> cactus

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

which<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.420> holding<00:01:45.750> off<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> flow<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> water

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
which are holding off the flow of water

which are holding off the flow of water
flip<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> switch<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> water<00:01:49.710> will<00:01:49.860> be

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
flip the switch the water will be

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
flip the switch the water will be
released<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> D<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.530> harvested<00:01:52.950> as

released and D we will be harvested as

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
released and D we will be harvested as
you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.600> pops<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.049> off<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you can see and it pops it all off and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.340 
you can see and it pops it all off and
brings<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.009> down<00:01:56.250> here<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.350> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
brings it all down here for you and you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
brings it all down here for you and you
could<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.369> isn't<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> capable

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
could this isn't really a capable

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
could this isn't really a capable
compatible<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.590> five-minute<00:02:02.040> timer<00:02:02.219> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
compatible with a five-minute timer just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
compatible with a five-minute timer just
because<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> replant<00:02:04.229> all

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
because you will have to replant all

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
because you will have to replant all
this<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.729> no<00:02:05.850> way<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
this because there's no way to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.900 
this because there's no way to
automatically<00:02:06.509> plant<00:02:07.160> wheat<00:02:08.160> right<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
automatically plant wheat right now so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.720 
automatically plant wheat right now so
it<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.539> automated<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.739> automatic

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it is just automated not automatic

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
it is just automated not automatic
so<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.140> can

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so as you can see all this down you can

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.259 
so as you can see all this down you can
make<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.680> walls<00:02:14.010> bigger<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.150> can

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
make these walls bigger so as you can

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.449 
make these walls bigger so as you can
see<00:02:15.390> hollows<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:15.989> there<00:02:16.230> I'll<00:02:16.459> start

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
see hollows are up there I'll start

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.280 
see hollows are up there I'll start
there<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.879> won't<00:02:18.030> happen<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.049> when<00:02:19.170> you're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
there that won't happen so when you're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.250 
there that won't happen so when you're
done<00:02:19.470> flip<00:02:19.769> your<00:02:19.920> switch<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.780> water<00:02:21.959> will<00:02:22.080> cut

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
done flip your switch the water will cut

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.869 
done flip your switch the water will cut
itself<00:02:22.440> off<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.280> make<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
itself off and you can make this to it

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.970 
itself off and you can make this to it
like<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> grand<00:02:24.780> scale<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.470> i<00:02:25.530> mean<00:02:25.709> i<00:02:25.860> have

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
like a grand scale of this i mean i have

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.440 
like a grand scale of this i mean i have
to<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.159> hop<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.489> here<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.330> just

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to do is hop up here and then just

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.539 
to do is hop up here and then just
replant<00:02:27.959> them<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.379> mean<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.040> make<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.160> huge

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
replant them i mean you can make a huge

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.630 
replant them i mean you can make a huge
scale<00:02:29.940> model<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:32.040> rows<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.580> rows

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
scale model of this like rows and rows

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
scale model of this like rows and rows
and<00:02:32.910> rows<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.810> pretty<00:02:33.989> nifty<00:02:34.230> now

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and rows of it it's pretty nifty now

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.750 
and rows of it it's pretty nifty now
we're<00:02:34.709> gonna<00:02:34.830> head<00:02:34.920> down<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.430> my<00:02:35.549> little

basement area sorry if it's a little
dark<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.519> where<00:02:38.970> my<00:02:39.000> mushrooms<00:02:39.810> grow

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
dark but this is where my mushrooms grow

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.399 
dark but this is where my mushrooms grow
as<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.819> can<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.659> don't<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.349> you

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
as you can see a I don't know if you

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.690 
as you can see a I don't know if you
guys<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.709> back<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.069> with<00:02:44.190> our<00:02:44.220> Pistons

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
guys can see back there with our Pistons

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.569 
guys can see back there with our Pistons
back<00:02:44.879> there<00:02:45.349> same<00:02:46.349> same<00:02:46.680> system<00:02:47.129> holding<00:02:47.459> off

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
back there same same system holding off

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.349 
back there same same system holding off
water<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.859> these<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.910> mushrooms

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
water and I have these these mushrooms

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.150 
water and I have these these mushrooms
up<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.049> ground<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> water<00:02:52.769> will<00:02:52.950> not

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
up off the ground so the water will not

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.460 
up off the ground so the water will not
touch<00:02:53.760> them<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.660> also<00:02:54.840> set<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.319> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
touch them and you can also set this to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.289 
touch them and you can also set this to
a<00:02:55.530> five-minute<00:02:56.099> timer<00:02:56.310> because<00:02:56.940> these<00:02:57.120> will

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
a five-minute timer because these will

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.849 
a five-minute timer because these will
actually<00:02:57.329> read<00:02:57.840> row<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.170> their<00:02:58.319> own<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.799> you

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
actually read row on their own so you

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.240 
actually read row on their own so you
hit<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.220> switch<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.500> water<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:01.920> pop<00:03:02.129> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
hit the switch the water will pop the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.690 
hit the switch the water will pop the
mushrooms<00:03:02.579> off<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.750> bring<00:03:04.170> them<00:03:04.319> down<00:03:04.500> here

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
mushrooms off and bring them down here

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.630 
mushrooms off and bring them down here
and<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.569> just<00:03:06.810> sit<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.170> collect<00:03:07.290> them

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and you just sit there and collect them

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.130 
and you just sit there and collect them
now<00:03:08.640> let<00:03:08.849> give<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> shout<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> my<00:03:09.840> friend

gamer<00:03:10.440> night<00:03:10.680> 107<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:12.030> gave<00:03:12.239> me<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.560> idea<00:03:13.560> for

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
gamer night 107 he gave me the idea for

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.550 
gamer night 107 he gave me the idea for
the<00:03:14.069> how<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.000> set<00:03:15.209> up<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> reed<00:03:15.569> farm<00:03:15.840> with<00:03:16.319> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the how to set up the reed farm with the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.460 
the how to set up the reed farm with the
top<00:03:17.489> two<00:03:17.700> layers<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:18.419> implemented<00:03:19.349> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
top two layers but I implemented the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.000 
top two layers but I implemented the
five-minute<00:03:19.980> timer<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.680> yeah<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.980> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
five-minute timer so yeah this is it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.370 
five-minute timer so yeah this is it
this<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.459> pretty<00:03:24.150> pretty<00:03:24.599> cool<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:24.959> observe

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
this is a pretty pretty cool for observe

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.890 
this is a pretty pretty cool for observe
idle<00:03:25.590> servers<00:03:25.889> because<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.970> get<00:03:27.450> collect

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
idle servers because you can get collect
