 two stratification vaccinations 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 half a week ago 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.820

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.650
 Now I will remove this wet filings 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.800
 several times over these two and a half 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:36.010
 weeks I was watering the sawdust and this 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:43.750
 I had a bottle of vaccinations on 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:50.109
 stood on a warm window-sill 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:53.109
 we get 1 perfectly look at the heels 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.949
 nodules formed callus 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.949
 and even two big roots 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.449
 this graft is a stalk already 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.540
 can be planted in the tank vozok eye 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.180
 swell and soon will rise in growth 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 there is i think here the splice goes 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.770
 ok here they look 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.189

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.540
 again good beautiful 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.570
 callus nodules 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.619
 and this stalk can also be planted 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.380
 into the tank and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:44.229

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.299
 It took two and a half weeks so on 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.630
 This is where the kidney moved on and the callus 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:04.020
 no therefore we will put this stalk still 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.429
 on the stratification here the callus flows 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.780
 . in growth can 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.980
 put in a container here too 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.569
 Carl Gauss is formed 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.170
 there is a spine here it is 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.590
 kidney moved into growth then out of 90 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.060
 percent one stalk we still 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.989
