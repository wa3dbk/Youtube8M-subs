00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
favorite the logic stylus diamond and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.670 
favorite the logic stylus diamond and
the<00:00:21.449> only<00:00:21.630> reason<00:00:21.900> why<00:00:22.020> we're<00:00:22.230> revisiting

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the only reason why we're revisiting

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220 
the only reason why we're revisiting
this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> users<00:00:24.539> left

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this is because one of the users left

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.859 
this is because one of the users left
the<00:00:25.350> comments<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.490> our<00:00:26.910> review<00:00:27.330> video<00:00:27.599> saying

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the comments in our review video saying

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.650 
the comments in our review video saying
that<00:00:27.960> there's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.070> dampening<00:00:29.460> tip<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that there's a dampening tip one that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
that there's a dampening tip one that
may<00:00:30.929> make<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.230> sound<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:32.040> less<00:00:32.279> annoying

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
may make it sound a little less annoying

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
may make it sound a little less annoying
when<00:00:32.850> you're<00:00:32.940> taking<00:00:33.270> notes<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.960> still

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
when you're taking notes so we still

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650 
when you're taking notes so we still
recommend<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.219> logic<00:00:35.520> stylus<00:00:35.940> diamond<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
recommend the logic stylus diamond but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.639 
recommend the logic stylus diamond but
we're<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.110> through<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
we're going to go through all the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
we're going to go through all the
different<00:00:38.340> details<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
different details we're going to do a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
different details we're going to do a
couple<00:00:39.660> close-up<00:00:40.050> shots<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> stylus<00:00:40.950> tips

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
couple close-up shots of the stylus tips

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
couple close-up shots of the stylus tips
and<00:00:41.670> we're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> couple<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and we're going to do a couple of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
and we're going to do a couple of
writing<00:00:43.379> tests<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.070> iPad<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
writing tests on an iPad to see if it's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
writing tests on an iPad to see if it's
actually<00:00:45.840> better<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.320> worse<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
actually better or worse or kind of the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.170 
actually better or worse or kind of the
same<00:00:47.940> anyways<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> original<00:00:50.670> jot

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
same anyways so this is the original jot

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
same anyways so this is the original jot
pearl<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> foreground<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:53.340> not

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pearl in the foreground and we're not

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.709 
pearl in the foreground and we're not
going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> talk<00:00:53.789> much<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to talk much about it because it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
going to talk much about it because it
is<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> original<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.770> already<00:00:55.949> talked

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
is the original one I already talked

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670 
is the original one I already talked
about<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.329> behind<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.899> we've<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
about that but behind it we've got the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
about that but behind it we've got the
new<00:00:58.829> jot<00:00:59.100> Pro<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> really<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> only

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
new jot Pro and really the only

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
new jot Pro and really the only
noticeable<00:01:00.629> difference<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.859> there's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
noticeable difference is that there's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
noticeable difference is that there's
this<00:01:02.430> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.789> black<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
this kind of black or in here and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.710 
this kind of black or in here and
there's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> dampening<00:01:05.159> tip<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> stamping

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
there's a dampening tip so the stamping

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
there's a dampening tip so the stamping
tip<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.049> compresses<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.580> user

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tip actually compresses when the user

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.010 
tip actually compresses when the user
pushes<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.670> stylus<00:01:11.670> head<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.900> tablets

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
pushes the stylus head into the tablets

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.420 
pushes the stylus head into the tablets
another<00:01:16.020> difference<00:01:16.439> between<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.830> old<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
another difference between the old and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
another difference between the old and
the<00:01:17.549> new<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> old<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> much

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the new is that the old one had a much

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.130 
the new is that the old one had a much
larger<00:01:19.409> plastic<00:01:19.650> plate<00:01:20.570> at<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> tip<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
larger plastic plate at the tip of the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.640 
larger plastic plate at the tip of the
stylus<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.119> plate<00:01:24.119> itself<00:01:24.509> had<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.380> cross

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
stylus and the plate itself had a cross

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
stylus and the plate itself had a cross
pattern<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> old<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> new<00:01:27.420> one

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
pattern in the old one and the new one

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.770 
pattern in the old one and the new one
has<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> bigger<00:01:28.829> circular<00:01:29.369> dot<00:01:29.780> in

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
has kind of a bigger circular dot in

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660 
has kind of a bigger circular dot in
terms<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> accuracy<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> didn't<00:01:32.280> find<00:01:32.460> much

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
terms of the accuracy I didn't find much

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.170 
terms of the accuracy I didn't find much
difference<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.259> maybe<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.430> too<00:01:35.759> finite

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
difference so this maybe it's too finite

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
difference so this maybe it's too finite
for<00:01:36.420> me<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:38.310> give<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> quick

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for me to see I'll give you a quick

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
for me to see I'll give you a quick
quick<00:01:39.299> example<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.710> compression<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
quick example of the compression for the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
quick example of the compression for the
dampening<00:01:42.150> tip<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.710> very<00:01:44.009> subtle<00:01:44.280> it's

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
dampening tip and it's very subtle it's

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
dampening tip and it's very subtle it's
really<00:01:45.090> hard<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.170> unless<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.770> watch<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
really hard to see unless you watch it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
really hard to see unless you watch it
very<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.520> carefully<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> new

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
very very carefully so that is the new

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
very very carefully so that is the new
jot<00:01:50.369> Pro<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> dampening<00:01:51.780> tip<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.649> we've

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
jot Pro with the dampening tip so we've

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.149 
jot Pro with the dampening tip so we've
got<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.460> logic<00:01:53.850> stylus<00:01:54.210> diamond<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
got the logic stylus diamond here and

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.609 
got the logic stylus diamond here and
the<00:01:56.159> new<00:01:56.430> jot<00:01:56.729> Pro<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> dampening<00:01:58.320> tip

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the new jot Pro with the dampening tip

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.800 
the new jot Pro with the dampening tip
and<00:01:58.829> we're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> writing<00:02:00.090> test<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and we're going to do a writing test and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
and we're going to do a writing test and
I<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> guys<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> pay<00:02:01.590> attention<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
I want you guys to pay attention to the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.090 
I want you guys to pay attention to the
noise<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.090> each<00:02:03.540> pen<00:02:03.840> makes<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.950> I'm

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
noise that each pen makes when I'm

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.819 
noise that each pen makes when I'm
writing<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> first<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.079> do<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
writing so the first one we will do the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.240 
writing so the first one we will do the
jock<00:02:08.039> curl<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> I'll<00:02:10.319> quickly<00:02:10.470> write<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> this

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
jock curl so I'll quickly write a this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:25.949 
jock curl so I'll quickly write a this
will<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> story<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.390> dog

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.750 

now<00:02:26.959> I'm<00:02:27.350> going<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.590> write<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> same<00:02:28.250> sentence

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
now I'm going to write the same sentence

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:44.500 
now I'm going to write the same sentence
with<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:30.170> logic<00:02:30.560> stylist<00:02:30.950> diamond

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.509 

and<00:02:44.599> as<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.349> can<00:02:45.470> tell<00:02:45.530> writing<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
and as you can tell writing with the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.449 
and as you can tell writing with the
stylus<00:02:46.939> diamond<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> much<00:02:48.290> quieter<00:02:49.159> than

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
stylus diamond is much quieter than

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.330 
stylus diamond is much quieter than
writing<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> jot<00:02:50.299> Pro<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.530> jot<00:02:51.829> Pro<00:02:51.860> has

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
writing with the jot Pro the jot Pro has

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.640 
writing with the jot Pro the jot Pro has
a<00:02:52.370> tendency<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:53.030> make<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.470> tapping<00:02:54.470> noise

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
a tendency to make this tapping noise

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.520 
a tendency to make this tapping noise
which<00:02:55.340> gets<00:02:55.909> kind<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.269> annoying<00:02:56.390> when<00:02:57.110> you're

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
which gets kind of annoying when you're

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.869 
which gets kind of annoying when you're
in<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.709> quiet<00:02:57.920> meeting<00:02:58.340> when<00:02:58.459> you're<00:02:58.610> trying<00:02:58.790> to

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
in a quiet meeting when you're trying to

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.170 
in a quiet meeting when you're trying to
take<00:02:59.120> notes<00:02:59.360> whereas<00:02:59.840> in<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.790> stylus<00:03:01.790> diamond

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
take notes whereas in the stylus diamond

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.839 
take notes whereas in the stylus diamond
is<00:03:02.709> when<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.799> tap<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.099> this<00:03:04.190> way<00:03:04.370> still<00:03:04.640> makes

is when you tap it this way still makes

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.149 
is when you tap it this way still makes
that<00:03:05.000> noise<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.360> when<00:03:05.510> you're<00:03:05.659> writing<00:03:06.159> that

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
that noise but when you're writing that

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.850 
that noise but when you're writing that
little<00:03:07.400> spring<00:03:07.819> tip<00:03:08.150> again<00:03:08.629> kind<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.079> conforms

little spring tip again kind of conforms

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
to the surface of the iPad so it doesn't

to the surface of the iPad so it doesn't
make<00:03:13.069> as<00:03:13.250> many<00:03:13.400> tapping<00:03:13.939> noises<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:15.170> again

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
make as many tapping noises so again

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.110 
make as many tapping noises so again
we're<00:03:16.010> going<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.220> stick<00:03:16.459> with<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.760> logic

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
we're going to stick with the logic

we're going to stick with the logic
stylus<00:03:17.510> diamond<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.790> again<00:03:20.720> if<00:03:20.870> you've<00:03:20.989> got<00:03:21.019> an

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.890 
original jot Pro I would keep it this
one<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.420> don't<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.019> much<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.379> an<00:03:24.530> upgrade

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
one I don't think as much of an upgrade

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:38.959 
one I don't think as much of an upgrade
