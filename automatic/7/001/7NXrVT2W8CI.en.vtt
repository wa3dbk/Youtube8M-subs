00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
all right so today we're going to show

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.210 
all right so today we're going to show
roughly<00:00:43.190> how<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.400> I<00:00:43.970> make<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.660> knife<00:00:45.320> from<00:00:45.800> black

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
roughly how we I make a knife from black

00:00:46.220 --> 00:01:02.060 
roughly how we I make a knife from black
steel<00:00:46.660> up<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:47.930> finished<00:00:48.199> product

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 

all<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.610> so<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.970> we're<00:01:03.180> obviously<00:01:03.809> we've

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
all right so now we're obviously we've

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
all right so now we're obviously we've
ground<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> blank<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ground the blank I'm going to do the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
ground the blank I'm going to do the
heat<00:01:06.210> treatment<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.010> heat

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
heat treatment now so this is my heat

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.180 
heat treatment now so this is my heat
treat<00:01:08.460> oven<00:01:09.260> I'm<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> preheat<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.010> up

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
treat oven I'm going to preheat this up

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.310 
treat oven I'm going to preheat this up
to<00:01:11.340> 500<00:01:11.850> degrees<00:01:11.940> before<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> blank<00:01:13.110> in

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to 500 degrees before I put the blank in

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
to 500 degrees before I put the blank in
it's<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> matter<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> clicking<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:15.540> on

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it's just a matter of clicking this on

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's just a matter of clicking this on
they'll<00:01:16.650> pop<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.660> I'll

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
they'll pop that on and now that I'll

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
they'll pop that on and now that I'll
preheat<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> 500<00:01:20.250> degrees<00:01:20.340> ready<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.940> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
preheat up to 500 degrees ready for the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
preheat up to 500 degrees ready for the
blind<00:01:23.090> all<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.810> ovens<00:01:25.050> will<00:01:25.170> put

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
blind all right so the ovens will put

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
blind all right so the ovens will put
temperature<00:01:25.800> now<00:01:25.950> 500<00:01:26.759> degrees<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.420> we're

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
temperature now 500 degrees so we're

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.980 
temperature now 500 degrees so we're
going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.690> pop<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> blank<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:29.060> okay<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
going to pop the blank in and okay up to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.740 
going to pop the blank in and okay up to
800<00:01:31.470> degrees<00:01:31.770> hole<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> heat<00:01:32.670> treat<00:01:32.940> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
800 degrees hole for the heat treat so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.180 
800 degrees hole for the heat treat so
it's<00:01:34.080> just<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> matter<00:01:34.410> of<00:01:34.530> opening<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.009> oven

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
it's just a matter of opening the oven

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.050 
it's just a matter of opening the oven
up<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:36.240> popping<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.750> blank<00:01:36.930> into<00:01:37.229> there

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
up I'm popping the blank into there

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.469 
up I'm popping the blank into there
popping<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.149> blank<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:42.860> closed<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> I'm

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
popping the blank in closed up so I'm

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.639 
popping the blank in closed up so I'm
just<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.780> turn<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.050> up<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> 800

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
just going to turn this up to 800

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.430 
just going to turn this up to 800
degrees<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.759> then<00:01:50.930> once<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
degrees and then once it's got the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.740 
degrees and then once it's got the
temperature<00:01:52.920> although<00:01:53.220> Alva<00:01:53.670> steel<00:01:53.880> steel<00:01:54.539> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
temperature although Alva steel steel to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.749 
temperature although Alva steel steel to
soak<00:01:55.580> okay<00:01:57.590> alright<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> nice<00:01:59.039> now<00:01:59.550> been

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
soak okay alright so the nice now been

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
soak okay alright so the nice now been
in<00:01:59.910> there<00:02:00.119> having<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.690> soak<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.140> 800

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
in there having a good soak at 800

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.370 
in there having a good soak at 800
degrees<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.539> now<00:02:03.539> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> quench<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
degrees and now going to quench it in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
degrees and now going to quench it in
the<00:02:04.500> oil<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.330> they'll<00:02:06.330> be<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.599> heat<00:02:06.750> treat

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the oil and they'll be the heat treat

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.240 
the oil and they'll be the heat treat
all<00:02:07.259> complete<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.410> transfer<00:02:13.860> from<00:02:13.920> where

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
all complete so we transfer from where

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.680 
all complete so we transfer from where
straight<00:02:14.520> into<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> oil<00:02:14.849> as<00:02:15.330> quick<00:02:15.569> as

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
straight into the oil as quick as

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.940 
straight into the oil as quick as
possible

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.229 

just<00:02:22.950> hold<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.549> for<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> while<00:02:23.909> just

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
just hold it in there for a while just

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:40.240 
just hold it in there for a while just
to<00:02:24.629> let<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> steel<00:02:25.140> cool<00:02:25.920> down

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.039 

and<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:41.519> go<00:02:41.689> that's<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.780> blade

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
and there we go that's the blade

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.899 
and there we go that's the blade
heat-treated<00:02:44.989> that's<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.110> blade<00:02:46.909> quenched

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
heat-treated that's the blade quenched

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.110 
heat-treated that's the blade quenched
in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> oil<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.010> actually<00:02:50.280> use<00:02:50.549> old<00:02:50.760> engine

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
in the oil so I actually use old engine

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.020 
in the oil so I actually use old engine
oil<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.859> just<00:02:52.859> obviously<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.489> easy<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.909> come

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
oil and just obviously it's easy to come

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.589 
oil and just obviously it's easy to come
by<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:56.430> cools<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.909> steel<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.359> really

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
by and it cools the steel down really

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.780 
by and it cools the steel down really
quickly<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.799> can<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.189> like<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> brine

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
quickly you can use like a brine

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.390 
quickly you can use like a brine
solution<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.739> get<00:03:01.890> quite<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.099> bit<00:03:02.310> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
solution but you can get quite a bit of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.920 
solution but you can get quite a bit of
spit<00:03:02.609> back<00:03:02.790> from<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:03.569> obviously

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
spit back from that which obviously

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.630 
spit back from that which obviously
coming<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.739> high<00:03:04.859> temperature<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.519> be

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
coming at high temperature it can be

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.869 
coming at high temperature it can be
quite<00:03:05.819> dangerous<00:03:06.950> engine<00:03:07.950> oils<00:03:08.190> also<00:03:08.459> got<00:03:08.670> its

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
quite dangerous engine oils also got its

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.849 
quite dangerous engine oils also got its
downsides<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.870> flare<00:03:10.109> up<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.440> stuff<00:03:10.680> like

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
downsides it can flare up and stuff like

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.649 
downsides it can flare up and stuff like
that<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:11.639> it's<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.209> matter<00:03:12.239> about

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
that but then it's just a matter about

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.460 
that but then it's just a matter about
being<00:03:13.170> careful<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.879> taking<00:03:14.879> precautions<00:03:15.470> so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
being careful and taking precautions so

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.080 
being careful and taking precautions so
now<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.799> quenched<00:03:17.519> we're<00:03:18.000> actually

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
now this is quenched we're actually

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.289 
now this is quenched we're actually
going<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.920> temper<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:19.980> slightly<00:03:20.280> take<00:03:21.000> some<00:03:21.209> of

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
going to temper it slightly take some of

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.899 
going to temper it slightly take some of
the<00:03:21.359> hardness<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.709> make<00:03:23.639> it

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
the hardness out of it and just make it

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.770 
the hardness out of it and just make it
less<00:03:24.750> brittle<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:26.239> then<00:03:27.239> it'll<00:03:27.389> be<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.689> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
less brittle and then it'll be on to the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.699 
less brittle and then it'll be on to the
handling<00:03:28.079> after<00:03:28.319> that

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.399 

right<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.879> I'm<00:03:35.969> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.260> temper<00:03:37.260> this

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
right now I'm going to a temper this

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.399 
right now I'm going to a temper this
deal<00:03:37.680> basically<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:39.140> soften<00:03:40.140> off<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
deal basically just soften off the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.459 
deal basically just soften off the
stress<00:03:40.650> points<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.250> knife<00:03:41.599> so<00:03:42.599> across

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:43.469 
stress points on the knife so across

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.729 
stress points on the knife so across
here<00:03:44.180> obviously<00:03:45.180> you've<00:03:45.569> got<00:03:45.599> a<00:03:45.780> tube<00:03:46.140> that's

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
here obviously you've got a tube that's

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.530 
here obviously you've got a tube that's
going<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.980> go<00:03:47.099> through<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.819> finish

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
going to go through there and finish

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.599 
going to go through there and finish
steel<00:03:48.750> we're<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.829> be<00:03:50.159> stressed<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
steel we're going to be stressed it

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.379 
steel we're going to be stressed it
there<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.209> along<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.599> spine<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.109> blade

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
there and along the spine of the blade

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.670 
there and along the spine of the blade
needs<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.569> with<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.750> blowtorch<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.530> then

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
needs it all with a blowtorch and then

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.979 
needs it all with a blowtorch and then
dump<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.579> straight<00:03:56.730> into<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> water<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.870> I'll

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
dump it straight into the water and I'll

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.709 
dump it straight into the water and I'll
call<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.409> down<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.359> heat<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.659> up

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719 
call it down so we just heat that up

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:09.690 
call it down so we just heat that up
with<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.989> bow<00:04:04.139> touch

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.880 

as<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.450> comes<00:04:10.810> up<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:10.989> temperature<00:04:11.319> you'll

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
as it comes up to temperature you'll

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.530 
as it comes up to temperature you'll
actually<00:04:12.040> start<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.610> see<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> color<00:04:13.060> change<00:04:13.390> in

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
actually start and see a color change in

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:28.740 
actually start and see a color change in
the<00:04:13.629> steel

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.960 

and<00:04:29.650> I'm<00:04:29.770> there<00:04:29.950> now<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.190> can<00:04:30.400> actually<00:04:30.730> see

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.790 

those<00:04:33.970> little<00:04:34.180> paintings<00:04:34.630> by<00:04:35.290> another<00:04:35.590> blade

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
