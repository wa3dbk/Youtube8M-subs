00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and the reason why I've said that is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.990 
and the reason why I've said that is
because<00:01:15.860> normally<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.189> Venise<00:01:17.580> items

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because normally on these Venise items

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
because normally on these Venise items
themselves<00:01:18.689> they're<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> color<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:20.189> this
