you get to the base of the neck you can

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.349 
you get to the base of the neck you can
kind<00:03:34.949> of<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.069> set<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.549> aside<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:35.940> right

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
kind of just set this aside for right

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.610 
kind of just set this aside for right
now<00:03:36.389> because<00:03:36.780> we're<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.079> move<00:03:37.260> into<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
now because we're going to move into the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.979 
now because we're going to move into the
braid<00:03:37.829> on<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> opposite<00:03:38.430> side<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.750> can

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
braid on the opposite side that you can

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.539 
braid on the opposite side that you can
see<00:03:40.349> that<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.739> really<00:03:40.980> starting<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> come

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
see that it's really starting to come

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.009 
see that it's really starting to come
together<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.120> build<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.449> really<00:03:42.870> pretty

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
together and build that really pretty

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.979 
together and build that really pretty
spine<00:03:43.410> that's<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:43.889> fishtail<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.810> keep

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
spine that's on a fishtail so to keep

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.780 
spine that's on a fishtail so to keep
this<00:03:46.230> out<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.859> for<00:03:47.280> now<00:03:47.459> I'm<00:03:47.699> just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this out of the way for now I'm just

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.199 
this out of the way for now I'm just
going<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.120> take<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.660> duckbill<00:03:49.290> clip<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.209> clip

going to take a duckbill clip and clip

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.059 
going to take a duckbill clip and clip
it<00:03:51.299> out<00:03:51.449> of<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.660> way<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.049> now<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:52.769> ready<00:03:52.919> to

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
it out of the way and now we're ready to

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.729 
it out of the way and now we're ready to
move<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.669> other<00:03:53.699> side<00:03:54.049> all<00:03:55.049> right<00:03:55.349> at<00:03:55.500> this

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
move to the other side all right at this

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.159 
move to the other side all right at this
point<00:03:55.889> we<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:57.060> fishtail<00:03:57.750> braids

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
point we have the to fishtail braids

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.050 
point we have the to fishtail braids
that<00:03:58.590> are<00:03:58.889> going<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.489> base<00:03:59.639> of<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.909> neck

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
that are going to the base of the neck

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.289 
that are going to the base of the neck
now<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:01.169> have<00:04:01.560> these<00:04:01.859> two<00:04:02.159> end<00:04:02.430> sections<00:04:02.579> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
now you have these two end sections the

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.939 
now you have these two end sections the
tales<00:04:03.540> from<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> bottom<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.379> fishtail

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
tales from the bottom of the fishtail

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.069 
tales from the bottom of the fishtail
and<00:04:05.310> at<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.209> point<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.569> have<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.690> couple<00:04:06.959> of

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
and at this point you have a couple of

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.589 
and at this point you have a couple of
options<00:04:07.229> you<00:04:07.709> can<00:04:07.889> either<00:04:08.010> twist<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:09.030> up<00:04:09.180> into

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
options you can either twist it up into

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.750 
options you can either twist it up into
a<00:04:09.629> loose<00:04:09.900> little<00:04:10.169> bun<00:04:10.379> but<00:04:11.129> Rachel<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.729> I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
a loose little bun but Rachel and I

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.250 
a loose little bun but Rachel and I
decided<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.449> would<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.569> fun<00:04:12.870> just<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.169> go

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
decided that it would be fun just to go

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.869 
decided that it would be fun just to go
ahead<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.949> treat<00:04:14.129> these<00:04:14.340> as<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.729> two

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
ahead and treat these as the two

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.759 
ahead and treat these as the two
sections<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.419> a<00:04:15.479> fishtail<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.199> just<00:04:16.349> add<00:04:16.500> one

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
sections of a fishtail and just add one

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.240 
sections of a fishtail and just add one
more<00:04:16.979> into<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> mix<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.950> take<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.099> two

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
more into the mix so take the two

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.709 
more into the mix so take the two
sections<00:04:20.489> I'm<00:04:20.789> keeping<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.150> clips<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.599> there

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
sections I'm keeping this clips in there

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.660 
sections I'm keeping this clips in there
for<00:04:21.959> now<00:04:22.079> if<00:04:22.800> you're<00:04:22.919> doing<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.219> yourself

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
for now if you're doing it yourself

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.740 
for now if you're doing it yourself
it's<00:04:23.760> going<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> make<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.180> lot<00:04:24.300> easier<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it's going to make it a lot easier to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.270 
it's going to make it a lot easier to
manage<00:04:25.100> taking<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.160> piece<00:04:26.370> from<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.790> outside

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
manage taking a piece from the outside

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.140 
manage taking a piece from the outside
bringing<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.760> back<00:04:29.910> Pony<00:04:31.910> again<00:04:32.910> a

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
bringing it to the back Pony again a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.290 
bringing it to the back Pony again a
piece<00:04:33.890> from<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.980> other<00:04:35.250> side<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:35.940> outside

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
piece from the other side on the outside

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.660 
piece from the other side on the outside
and<00:04:36.480> bring<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.960> I'm<00:04:37.230> pulling<00:04:38.160> on<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.310> fairly

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
and bring it in I'm pulling on it fairly

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.430 
and bring it in I'm pulling on it fairly
tight<00:04:39.030> here<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.630> want<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> make<00:04:40.080> sure<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.260> have

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
tight here I want to make sure I have

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.680 
tight here I want to make sure I have
enough<00:04:40.470> tension<00:04:41.090> can<00:04:42.090> then<00:04:42.210> take<00:04:42.420> out<00:04:42.570> these

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
enough tension can then take out these

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.400 
enough tension can then take out these
clips<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.140> get<00:04:43.260> them<00:04:43.380> out<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.500> your<00:04:43.620> way<00:04:45.410> at

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
clips to get them out of your way at

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.630 
clips to get them out of your way at
this<00:04:46.560> point<00:04:46.740> we're<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:46.980> doing<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.250> classic

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
this point we're just doing a classic

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.550 
this point we're just doing a classic
fishtail<00:04:50.690> all<00:04:51.690> right<00:04:51.870> we're<00:04:52.080> getting<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
fishtail all right we're getting to the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.590 
fishtail all right we're getting to the
bottom<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.100> brain<00:04:53.310> at<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.700> point<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.540> I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
bottom of the brain at this point so I

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360 
bottom of the brain at this point so I
want<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.780> breed<00:04:54.960> as<00:04:55.110> much<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.830> hair<00:04:56.100> and

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
want to breed as much of this hair and

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.920 
want to breed as much of this hair and
as<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.760> can<00:04:57.030> take<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> clear<00:04:58.440> rubber<00:04:58.920> band<00:04:59.930> and

as I can take a clear rubber band and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.120 
as I can take a clear rubber band and
just<00:05:01.410> bind<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.100> off<00:05:03.620> one<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.860> things

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
just bind it off one of the things

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.110 
just bind it off one of the things
that's<00:05:05.370> nice<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.390> do<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:08.340> not<00:05:08.490> completely

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
that's nice to do is to not completely

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
that's nice to do is to not completely
pull<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.510> through<00:05:09.780> at<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.320> end<00:05:11.750> but<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.960> create

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
pull it through at the end but to create

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.290 
pull it through at the end but to create
a<00:05:13.350> little<00:05:13.680> bit<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.010> loop<00:05:14.280> because<00:05:14.910> then<00:05:15.210> you

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
a little bit of a loop because then you

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.630 
a little bit of a loop because then you
have<00:05:15.420> a<00:05:15.450> place<00:05:15.690> for<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.990> pen<00:05:16.170> to<00:05:16.410> sit<00:05:16.680> when<00:05:17.520> you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
have a place for the pen to sit when you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.750 
have a place for the pen to sit when you
twist<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.150> into<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.480> bun<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:20.430> now<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.610> have<00:05:20.670> your

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
twist it into a bun so now you have your

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160 
twist it into a bun so now you have your
fish<00:05:21.000> tail<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.660> could<00:05:21.840> wear<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.050> down

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
fish tail and you could wear it down

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.380 
fish tail and you could wear it down
just<00:05:22.350> like<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.710> too<00:05:22.950> but<00:05:23.670> I<00:05:23.700> think<00:05:23.970> it's<00:05:24.150> nice

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
just like that too but I think it's nice

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.280 
just like that too but I think it's nice
to<00:05:24.690> at<00:05:24.840> this<00:05:25.020> point<00:05:25.430> pull<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.580> apart<00:05:26.670> slightly

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.760 

opening<00:05:31.290> up<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.560> texture<00:05:32.130> and<00:05:32.990> then<00:05:33.990> simply

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
opening up that texture and then simply

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.460 
opening up that texture and then simply
twist<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.460> onto<00:05:36.000> itself<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.780> tuck<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.260> the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
twist it onto itself and tuck in the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.740 
twist it onto itself and tuck in the
edge<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:38.610> ends<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:40.970> putting<00:05:41.970> in<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> couple<00:05:42.660> of

pins<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.440> secure<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:44.900> just<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.140> lock<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.590> all<00:05:46.770> in
