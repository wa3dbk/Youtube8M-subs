result here today 21 riders obviously
once<00:00:40.290> again<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:42.079> hopefully<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
once again but hopefully we can have a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
once again but hopefully we can have a
bit<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.460> better<00:00:44.879> result<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.809> German

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379

oliviero up in a bit contact there's not
intentional<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:21.920> bigoted<00:01:22.920> begging<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
intentional and bigoted begging it I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.609 
intentional and bigoted begging it I
can't<00:01:24.270> even<00:01:24.479> pronounce<00:01:24.630> his<00:01:24.900> name<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.380> I

guess<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.829> much<00:01:29.280> calling<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.790> near<00:01:30.030> it's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
guess I'm much calling back near it's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.680 
guess I'm much calling back near it's
certainly<00:01:30.750> easier

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
certainly easier

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.360 
certainly easier
there<00:01:33.470> might<00:01:33.620> be<00:01:33.650> how<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:33.950> pronounce<00:01:34.160> in<00:01:34.520> dena

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
there might be how you pronounce in dena

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.420 
there might be how you pronounce in dena
actually<00:01:37.510> back<00:01:38.510> Noah<00:01:38.980> back<00:01:39.980> nine<00:01:40.220> there<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
actually back Noah back nine there you

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
actually back Noah back nine there you
back<00:01:43.430> Noah<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.270> nearly

back Noah and to nearly

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.679 
back Noah and to nearly
danielle<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.230 

so<00:01:53.689> instance<00:01:54.049> what<00:01:54.170> five<00:01:54.409> once<00:01:54.680> again<00:01:54.950> now

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
so instance what five once again now

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.789 
so instance what five once again now
this<00:01:56.240> could<00:01:56.479> be<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.840> closest<00:01:57.289> we've<00:01:57.470> been<00:01:57.649> to

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
this could be the closest we've been to

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.219 
this could be the closest we've been to
a<00:01:57.829> race<00:01:58.899> which<00:01:59.899> wintering<00:02:04.659> if<00:02:05.659> they<00:02:05.869> read<00:02:06.110> more

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
a race which wintering if they read more

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.029 
a race which wintering if they read more
are<00:02:06.350> they<00:02:06.439> modified<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.189> seems<00:02:08.090> different

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
are they modified that seems different

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.130 
are they modified that seems different
take<00:02:10.039> note<00:02:10.190> modified<00:02:10.640> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.990 

last<00:02:13.800> year<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.580> seemed<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
last year that was that seemed to be a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.420 
last year that was that seemed to be a
lot<00:02:15.150> tighter<00:02:15.450> than<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.280> thing<00:02:17.280> that's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
lot tighter than is the thing that's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
lot tighter than is the thing that's
modified<00:02:18.000> correct<00:02:18.600> me<00:02:18.720> wrong<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
modified correct me wrong but I think it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.360 
modified correct me wrong but I think it
is<00:02:20.060> data<00:02:21.060> bank<00:02:21.450> acquired

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.690 

I<00:02:28.459> think<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.330> lot<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.510> people<00:02:30.489> understand<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.610> lot

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
I think a lot of people understand a lot

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.920 
I think a lot of people understand a lot
of<00:02:31.760> people<00:02:32.000> don't<00:02:32.209> like<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.450> graphics<00:02:32.659> in

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
of people don't like the graphics in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.410 
of people don't like the graphics in
this<00:02:32.959> game<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.849> know<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:35.000> agree

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
this game and I think you know I agree

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.210 
this game and I think you know I agree
that<00:02:35.450> they're<00:02:35.780> not<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.200> great<00:02:36.409> in<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.010> xbox

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
that they're not that great in the xbox

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.759 
that they're not that great in the xbox
version<00:02:37.549> but<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.269> think<00:02:39.230> it's<00:02:39.379> actually<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.650> lot

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
version but I think it's actually a lot

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.289 
version but I think it's actually a lot
more<00:02:39.830> down<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> coloring<00:02:40.909> I<00:02:41.030> think<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
more down to the coloring I think the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.289 
more down to the coloring I think the
coloring<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.140> game<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.440> quite<00:02:42.680> dull<00:02:43.299> and

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
coloring of this game is quite dull and

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.170 
coloring of this game is quite dull and
might<00:02:44.750> look<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.989> bit<00:02:45.019> different<00:02:45.349> on<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
might look a bit different on the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.009 
might look a bit different on the
recording<00:02:47.180> because<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.420> normally<00:02:47.720> makes<00:02:47.840> it

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
recording because it normally makes it

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.369 
recording because it normally makes it
look<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.200> bit<00:02:48.230> nicer<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.909> terms<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.810> like<00:02:51.140> how

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
look a bit nicer in terms of like how

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.319 
look a bit nicer in terms of like how
the<00:02:51.440> colors<00:02:51.860> look<00:02:51.920> at<00:02:52.129> everything<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
the colors look at everything but in the

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.360 
the colors look at everything but in the
actual<00:02:53.480> game<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.140> colors<00:02:54.470> don't<00:02:55.040> look

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
actual game the colors don't look

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.580 
actual game the colors don't look
they're<00:02:55.640> great<00:02:55.970> they're<00:02:56.420> quite<00:02:56.720> bland<00:02:57.079> quite

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
they're great they're quite bland quite

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.550 
they're great they're quite bland quite
gray<00:02:57.980> quite<00:02:58.640> dull<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.170> they<00:03:00.319> are<00:03:00.470> in

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
gray quite dull not like they are in

gray quite dull not like they are in
real<00:03:00.709> life<00:03:00.940> howdy<00:03:01.940> there<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.620> yeah<00:03:03.829> that's<00:03:04.549> I

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
real life howdy there so yeah that's I

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.640 
real life howdy there so yeah that's I
think<00:03:04.910> one<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> reasons<00:03:05.540> why<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
think one of the reasons why the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.220 
think one of the reasons why the
graphics<00:03:07.160> don't<00:03:07.790> look<00:03:07.970> too<00:03:08.120> good<00:03:08.150> am<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.900> going

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
graphics don't look too good am I going

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.119 
graphics don't look too good am I going

wouldn't<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.360> be<00:03:38.390> quite<00:03:38.720> cool<00:03:38.960> to<00:03:39.140> break<00:03:39.440> into

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.980 

and<00:03:51.740> be<00:03:51.860> quite<00:03:52.040> cool<00:03:52.280> wouldn't<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.720> first

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
and be quite cool wouldn't it the first

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.230 
and be quite cool wouldn't it the first
of<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.470> third<00:03:54.800> person<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.520> get<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.760> top<00:03:56.030> to

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
of a third person to get a top to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.430 

I<00:04:07.849> think<00:04:08.240> we<00:04:08.330> might<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.720> beat<00:04:08.900> me<00:04:08.930> as<00:04:09.230> that

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
I think we might just beat me as that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.039 
I think we might just beat me as that
time<00:04:09.709> there

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.240 

yes<00:04:17.620> we<00:04:17.919> did

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.060 

no<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:25.360> might<00:04:25.540> be<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.290> was<00:04:26.410> opportunity

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
no that might be it that was opportunity

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:36.270 
no that might be it that was opportunity
and<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> just<00:04:27.340> completely<00:04:28.650> missed<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.860> one<00:04:30.040> up

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.340 

trying<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.300> got<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.420> bit<00:04:37.600> too<00:04:37.750> fast<00:04:37.930> into<00:04:38.260> the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
trying to got a bit too fast into the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:49.580 
trying to got a bit too fast into the
braking<00:04:38.710> zone<00:04:38.950> nope<00:04:39.790> wasn't<00:04:40.210> clever<00:04:40.570> idea

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.410 

saying<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:50.490> we've<00:04:50.610> managed<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.000> fight<00:04:51.240> back

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
saying that we've managed to fight back

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.370 
saying that we've managed to fight back
a<00:04:51.450> little<00:04:51.660> bit<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:54.290> my<00:04:55.290> own<00:04:55.440> wife<00:04:55.740> yes<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.310> am<00:04:56.490> I

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
a little bit here my own wife yes I am I

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.600 
a little bit here my own wife yes I am I
should<00:04:58.380> name<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.770> corner<00:04:59.100> after<00:04:59.160> me<00:04:59.460> because

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
should name that corner after me because

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.030 
should name that corner after me because
of<00:04:59.880> all<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.240> times<00:05:00.900> I've<00:05:01.110> not<00:05:01.470> gone<00:05:01.680> round<00:05:01.830> it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
of all the times I've not gone round it

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:16.530 
of all the times I've not gone round it
properly<00:05:03.380> yep<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.560> think<00:05:04.830> so

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
I will not that far behind could it be a

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:33.399 
I will not that far behind could it be a
lost<00:05:20.650> corner<00:05:21.460> lunge<00:05:21.700> it<00:05:22.150> might<00:05:22.390> be<00:05:22.600> actually

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.529
