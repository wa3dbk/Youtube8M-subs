the<00:00:43.370> air<00:00:43.490> strike<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:43.940> support<00:00:44.630> unit<00:00:44.660> that

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
the air strike is a support unit that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.980 
the air strike is a support unit that
rains<00:00:45.620> destruction<00:00:46.400> from<00:00:46.700> above<00:00:47.060> and<00:00:47.300> deals

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
rains destruction from above and deals

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.370

huge damage to enemy ground units a

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.600 
huge damage to enemy ground units a
strike<00:00:51.380> can<00:00:51.530> be<00:00:51.680> one<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.190> most<00:00:52.340> deadly

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
strike can be one of the most deadly

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.750 
strike can be one of the most deadly
units<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.540> game<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.160> destroy<00:00:55.160> multiple

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
units in the game and destroy multiple

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.570 
units in the game and destroy multiple
enemies<00:00:56.660> at<00:00:56.840> once<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:57.710> they<00:00:58.100> can<00:00:58.280> also<00:00:58.309> be

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
enemies at once but they can also be

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.790 
enemies at once but they can also be
completely<00:00:59.330> insignificant<00:00:59.780> in<00:01:00.320> battle<00:01:00.650> if

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
completely insignificant in battle if

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.670 
completely insignificant in battle if
used<00:01:01.010> incorrectly<00:01:02.080> so<00:01:03.080> what<00:01:03.379> are<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.559> main

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
used incorrectly so what are the main

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.439 
used incorrectly so what are the main
differences<00:01:03.920> between<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:05.000> different<00:01:05.330> their

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
differences between the different their

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.150 
differences between the different their
strike<00:01:05.690> units<00:01:06.020> let's<00:01:06.560> take<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.770> closer<00:01:07.070> look

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
strike units let's take a closer look

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.280 
strike units let's take a closer look
okay<00:01:10.160> we<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:10.729> have<00:01:11.000> three<00:01:11.240> types<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.810> strike

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
okay we now have three types of a strike

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.650 
okay we now have three types of a strike
and<00:01:12.590> they<00:01:12.770> are<00:01:12.890> all<00:01:13.100> event<00:01:13.430> space<00:01:13.670> however

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
and they are all event space however

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.510 
and they are all event space however
they<00:01:15.200> are<00:01:15.229> unique<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.830> way<00:01:15.979> they<00:01:16.250> deal

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
they are unique in the way they deal

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.160 
they are unique in the way they deal
damage<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.149> there<00:01:17.300> are<00:01:17.390> different<00:01:17.780> tactics

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
damage and there are different tactics

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.580 
damage and there are different tactics
for<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:20.240> first<00:01:20.479> step<00:01:20.600> uses<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.080> skill

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
for it the first step uses a skill

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.340 
for it the first step uses a skill
called<00:01:22.220> bomb<00:01:22.700> run<00:01:22.940> which<00:01:23.600> deals<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.080> large

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
called bomb run which deals a large

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.680 
called bomb run which deals a large
amount<00:01:24.619> of<00:01:24.649> damage<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.190> an<00:01:25.280> area<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:26.420> type<00:01:26.660> is

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
amount of damage to an area this type is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.260 
amount of damage to an area this type is
the<00:01:27.140> safest<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.860> most<00:01:27.950> guaranteed<00:01:28.790> weight<00:01:29.060> of

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
the safest and most guaranteed weight of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.200 
the safest and most guaranteed weight of
dealing<00:01:29.869> damage<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:31.100> second<00:01:31.700> type<00:01:31.850> uses<00:01:32.180> a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
dealing damage the second type uses a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.050 
dealing damage the second type uses a
scale<00:01:32.540> call<00:01:32.780> napalm<00:01:33.399> deals<00:01:34.399> damage<00:01:34.610> over<00:01:35.030> time

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
scale call napalm deals damage over time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.900 
scale call napalm deals damage over time
in<00:01:35.390> an<00:01:35.509> area<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.140> slows<00:01:36.410> enemy<00:01:36.800> if<00:01:37.580> there's<00:01:37.850> a

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
in an area and slows enemy if there's a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.790 
in an area and slows enemy if there's a
large<00:01:38.210> group<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.540> enemies<00:01:38.930> concentrated<00:01:39.680> in

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
large group of enemies concentrated in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.210 
large group of enemies concentrated in
one<00:01:39.830> area<00:01:40.039> or<00:01:40.789> if<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.119> unit<00:01:41.390> has<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.890> higher<00:01:42.890> mo

rating the comendo can be very lethal

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.780 
rating the comendo can be very lethal
and<00:01:47.440> finally<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.770> type<00:01:49.010> uses<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> skill

very long area in kennesaw stun enemies
this<00:01:56.360> commander<00:01:56.780> has<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.930> much<00:01:57.170> larger<00:01:57.590> blast

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
this commander has a much larger blast

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.039 
this commander has a much larger blast
radius<00:01:58.070> than<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> other<00:01:58.729> two<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.780> deals

less damage and can not hit turrets so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.740 
less damage and can not hit turrets so
how<00:02:04.400> do<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.700> use<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.880> strike<00:02:05.330> in<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.540> most

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
how do we use a strike in the most

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.390 
how do we use a strike in the most
effective<00:02:06.170> way<00:02:06.320> what<00:02:06.560> are<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.770> best<00:02:06.920> tactics

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
effective way what are the best tactics

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.930 
effective way what are the best tactics
let's<00:02:07.909> have<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> look<00:02:09.399> there<00:02:10.399> are<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.549> few<00:02:10.729> things

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
let's have a look there are a few things

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.880 
let's have a look there are a few things
to<00:02:11.180> keep<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.420> mind<00:02:11.480> when<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.019> when<00:02:12.380> using<00:02:12.590> a

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
to keep in mind when you when using a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670 
to keep in mind when you when using a
strike<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.880> first<00:02:14.150> one<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.350> strike

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
strike the first one is the a strike

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.100 
strike the first one is the a strike
takes<00:02:16.040> time<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.640> reach<00:02:16.820> their<00:02:17.180> destination<00:02:17.930> so

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
takes time to reach their destination so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.949 
takes time to reach their destination so
timing<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.620> most<00:02:18.890> important<00:02:19.400> factor<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
timing is the most important factor the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.810 
timing is the most important factor the
easiest<00:02:21.380> way<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> make<00:02:21.830> sure<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.250> hit<00:02:22.370> enemies

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
easiest way to make sure you hit enemies

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.970 
easiest way to make sure you hit enemies
is<00:02:22.970> by<00:02:23.120> making<00:02:23.570> sure<00:02:24.019> they're<00:02:24.320> standing<00:02:24.680> still

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
is by making sure they're standing still

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.360 
is by making sure they're standing still
and<00:02:25.190> engaging<00:02:25.670> your<00:02:25.970> units<00:02:26.360> already<00:02:27.370> secondly

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and engaging your units already secondly

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.280 
and engaging your units already secondly
make<00:02:28.820> sure<00:02:29.060> your<00:02:29.239> ass<00:02:29.420> track<00:02:29.690> isn't<00:02:29.840> damaged

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
make sure your ass track isn't damaged

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.229 
make sure your ass track isn't damaged
on<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.530> way<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.160> target<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:31.820> they'll

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
on the way to the target because they'll

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.440 
on the way to the target because they'll
deal<00:02:32.510> reduced<00:02:33.049> damage<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> case<00:02:34.360> Erin<00:02:35.360> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
deal reduced damage in that case Erin to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
deal reduced damage in that case Erin to
set<00:02:35.660> units<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.140> your<00:02:36.290> biggest<00:02:36.620> threat<00:02:37.120> but

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
set units are your biggest threat but

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.150 
set units are your biggest threat but
avian<00:02:38.690> infantry<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.530> greatly<00:02:39.650> reduce

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
avian infantry can I so greatly reduce

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.509 
avian infantry can I so greatly reduce
your<00:02:40.370> units<00:02:40.700> potential<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.590> ideally<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.310> want

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
your units potential so ideally you want

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.340 
your units potential so ideally you want
to<00:02:43.700> deploy<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.209> strike<00:02:44.510> right<00:02:44.900> after<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
to deploy in a strike right after the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.990 
to deploy in a strike right after the
enemy<00:02:45.650> uses<00:02:45.950> an<00:02:46.100> hour<00:02:46.250> intercepts<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.820> you

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
enemy uses an hour intercepts so you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.930 
enemy uses an hour intercepts so you
know<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.329> can't<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.780> countered<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:49.489> finally

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
know you can't be countered and finally

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.000 
know you can't be countered and finally
this<00:02:50.120> may<00:02:50.359> be<00:02:50.419> obvious<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.230> make<00:02:51.650> sure<00:02:51.680> you're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
this may be obvious but make sure you're

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.340 
this may be obvious but make sure you're
a<00:02:52.340> strike<00:02:52.700> units<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.780> approach

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
a strike units is that the approach

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620 
a strike units is that the approach
level<00:02:54.770> units<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> reduced<00:02:55.550> rate<00:02:56.300> against

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
level units have a reduced rate against

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.020 
level units have a reduced rate against
higher<00:02:56.960> level<00:02:57.350> enemies<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:57.980> with<00:02:58.550> air<00:02:58.700> strike

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
higher level enemies and with air strike

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.560 
higher level enemies and with air strike
this<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.230> very<00:03:00.560> important<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.210> miss<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
this is very important if you miss the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.100 
this is very important if you miss the
enemy<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.800> waste<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.280> unit<00:03:08.110> hey
