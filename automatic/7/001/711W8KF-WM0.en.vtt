guns it has really good accuracy to
which<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.670> surprising<00:01:33.299> especially<00:01:33.390> for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
which is surprising especially for

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.580 
which is surprising especially for
something<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.920> least<00:01:35.040> I'd<00:01:35.250> assume<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
something that at least I'd assume is a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
something that at least I'd assume is a
submachine<00:01:37.590> gun<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.670> people

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
submachine gun I know about all people

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
submachine gun I know about all people
the<00:01:39.000> students<00:01:39.360> using<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.780> second<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the students using this second not the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.740 
the students using this second not the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
not the fully upgraded version so he

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.410 
not the fully upgraded version so he
can't<00:01:42.960> beat<00:01:43.110> me<00:01:43.259> um<00:01:44.040> hey<00:01:44.640> Stan<00:01:44.909> p<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> just

hurts you now when you use the gravity

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
hurts you now when you use the gravity
on<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.450> took<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> while<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> kill<00:01:55.140> him
