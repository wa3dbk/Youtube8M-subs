exercises and body parts should you use
them<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.430> pyramid<00:00:32.430> sets<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.969> nothing<00:00:33.840> more

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
them and pyramid sets is nothing more

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
them and pyramid sets is nothing more
than<00:00:34.320> starting<00:00:34.800> off<00:00:34.950> light<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.520> working<00:00:36.120> your

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
than starting off light and working your

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.170 
than starting off light and working your
way<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.420> heavier<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.230> each<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.180> ideally

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
way up heavier with each set and ideally

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
way up heavier with each set and ideally
you<00:00:39.390> should<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.260> every<00:00:40.860> exercise

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you should do this with every exercise

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
you should do this with every exercise
to<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.540> degree<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.410> should<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.829> off

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
to some degree you should start off

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.270 
to some degree you should start off
light<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> warm-up<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.950> do<00:00:46.950> several

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
light as a warm-up and then do several

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.639 
light as a warm-up and then do several
progressively<00:00:47.940> heavier<00:00:48.149> warm-up<00:00:49.140> sets<00:00:49.379> until

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
progressively heavier warm-up sets until

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
progressively heavier warm-up sets until
you<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> your<00:00:50.250> top<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.030> working

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you get up to your top and be working

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.119 
you get up to your top and be working
weight<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> demonstrate

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
weight so I'm just going to demonstrate

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.000 
weight so I'm just going to demonstrate
an<00:00:53.910> example<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.660> how<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.170> would<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.410> pyramid

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
an example of how I would use pyramid

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
an example of how I would use pyramid
sets<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:57.600> any

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
sets and I do this pretty much any

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.349 
sets and I do this pretty much any
exercise<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:59.129> we're<00:00:59.430> training<00:00:59.820> shoulders

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
exercise but we're training shoulders

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
exercise but we're training shoulders
tonight<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.840> shoulder<00:01:01.350> price<00:01:01.609> now<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:04.159> use

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
tonight so shoulder price now just use

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
tonight so shoulder price now just use
very<00:01:05.430> light<00:01:05.729> weight<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> 25

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
very light weight so I just have a 25

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.160 
very light weight so I just have a 25
pound<00:01:07.619> plate<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.130> each<00:01:08.280> side<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.900> ideas<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pound plate on each side and ideas just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
pound plate on each side and ideas just
go<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:10.590> light<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:12.299> warm<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.930> the

muscles warm up the joints and then with

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
muscles warm up the joints and then with
just<00:01:15.630> work<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.050> up<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.530> peer<00:01:16.890> hit<00:01:17.100> up

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 

alright<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.450> first<00:01:33.810> warm-up

alright so that was the first warm-up

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.370 
alright so that was the first warm-up
set<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.640> pure<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
set now I'm going to pure it up to a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:49.230 
set now I'm going to pure it up to a
heavier<00:01:37.799> weight

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.210 

another<00:01:50.240> set<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.170> some<00:01:51.500> people<00:01:51.710> when<00:01:52.040> they're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
another set now some people when they're

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.310 
another set now some people when they're
doing<00:01:52.340> pyramid<00:01:52.850> sets<00:01:53.090> will<00:01:53.480> increase<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
doing pyramid sets will increase the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.530 
doing pyramid sets will increase the
weight<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.680> decrease<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.400> reps<00:01:55.640> with<00:01:56.270> each

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
weight and decrease the reps with each

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.710 
weight and decrease the reps with each
set<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.080> that's<00:01:57.980> kind<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.940> view<00:01:59.240> but<00:01:59.450> for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
set and that's kind of view but for

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.540 
set and that's kind of view but for
warm-up<00:02:00.080> set<00:02:00.290> purposes<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.980> kind<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.310> like<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
warm-up set purposes I kind of like to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.520 
warm-up set purposes I kind of like to
keep<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.820> reps<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.570> same<00:02:02.840> throughout<00:02:03.230> and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
keep the reps the same throughout and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:03:05.100 
keep the reps the same throughout and
just<00:02:03.680> increase<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.160> weight<00:02:04.310> each<00:02:04.910> set

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:37.690 

you

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.330 

okay<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.180> there<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:40.110> my<00:03:40.319> top<00:03:40.799> heavy

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
okay so that there is my top heavy

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.699 
okay so that there is my top heavy
weight<00:03:41.489> pyramid<00:03:42.480> set<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.230> obviously<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
weight pyramid set and obviously to

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
weight pyramid set and obviously to
start<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.129> off<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> increase<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> weight

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
start it off and increase the weight

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.699 
start it off and increase the weight
with<00:03:45.900> each<00:03:46.109> set

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
with each set

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.030 
with each set
now<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.700> technically<00:03:48.689> half<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.109> pyramid<00:03:49.560> if

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
now that's technically half a pyramid if

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.039 
now that's technically half a pyramid if
you<00:03:50.250> want<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.579> can<00:03:50.760> do<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.879> full<00:03:51.269> pyramid<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
you want you can do a full pyramid and

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.559 
you want you can do a full pyramid and
work<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:52.799> way<00:03:52.920> back<00:03:53.220> down<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.540> a

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
work your way back down and this is a

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.199 
work your way back down and this is a
really<00:03:55.230> intense<00:03:55.769> way<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.159> train<00:03:56.549> because

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
really intense way to train because

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.210 
really intense way to train because
you're<00:03:57.629> working<00:03:58.049> through<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.620> complete

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
you're working through that complete
