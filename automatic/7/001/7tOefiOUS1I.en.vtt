giant 2014 catalog you're getting kind

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
giant 2014 catalog you're getting kind
of<00:01:52.890> brushing<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> my<00:01:53.460> specs<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.360> bit

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
of brushing up on my specs a little bit

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
of brushing up on my specs a little bit
but<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.860> overall<00:01:56.280> weight

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
but they go over the overall weight

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
but they go over the overall weight
obviously<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.020> fat<00:01:58.229> as

obviously it's not going to be as fat as
a<00:01:58.409> 29er<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.180> amount<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.079> weight

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a 29er but you know the amount of weight

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.740 
a 29er but you know the amount of weight
increase<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> amount<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.700> efficiency<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
increase to the amount of efficiency and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.490 
increase to the amount of efficiency and
all<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> above<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:05.299> supposedly<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:07.439> know

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
all of the above is supposedly you know

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
all of the above is supposedly you know
better<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.789> frame<00:02:09.179> geometry<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:10.050> can

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
better and the frame geometry they can

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
better and the frame geometry they can
change<00:02:10.500> again<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
change again because it's that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.930 
change again because it's that
in-between<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.540> 26th

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940
