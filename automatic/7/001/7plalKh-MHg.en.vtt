think I think Chris Algieri has a good

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.970 
think I think Chris Algieri has a good
chance<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:43.530> giving<00:00:43.680> him<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
chance a lot of people are giving him a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.150 
chance a lot of people are giving him a
good<00:00:44.160> chance<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> only<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.860> Chris

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
good chance but the only way I see Chris

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340

Algieri<00:00:47.370> winning<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.059> fight<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.989> he

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Algieri winning this fight if if he

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.220 
Algieri winning this fight if if he
boxes<00:00:49.920> throughout<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> entire<00:00:51.510> fight<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
boxes throughout the entire fight and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.270 
boxes throughout the entire fight and
chances<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.489> i<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.719> he<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
chances are i don't think he can do that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
chances are i don't think he can do that
I<00:00:56.489> mean<00:00:56.699> he's<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.090> tie<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.539> someday<00:00:57.899> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
once he tires out tires out he'll be

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
probably win the first few rounds I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.770 
probably win the first few rounds I
would<00:01:30.600> say<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> fight<00:01:32.280> goes<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
would say and then as the fight goes on

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
would say and then as the fight goes on
Ruslan<00:01:33.780> provodnikov<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.710> we'll<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.130> some

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
punishment on him to the body to the
head<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.520> possibly<00:01:38.520> stop<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> fight<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
head and possibly stop the fight and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
head and possibly stop the fight and
this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> biggest<00:01:40.170> step<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.860> Chris

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is the biggest step up for Chris

this is the biggest step up for Chris
Algieri<00:01:41.299> at<00:01:42.299> least<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:42.689> opinion<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
Algieri at least in my opinion is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
Algieri at least in my opinion is
definitely<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> biggest<00:01:43.740> step<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> do

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
definitely the biggest step up if you do

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.340 
definitely the biggest step up if you do
