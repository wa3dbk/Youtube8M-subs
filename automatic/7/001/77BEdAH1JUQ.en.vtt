another<00:00:00.539> effective<00:00:01.110> way<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.949> decorate<00:00:02.129> is

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
another effective way to decorate is

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.769 
another effective way to decorate is
using<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.510> stippling<00:00:03.780> brush<00:00:04.609> or<00:00:05.609> sponges<00:00:06.299> now

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
using a stippling brush or sponges now

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.720 
using a stippling brush or sponges now
stippling<00:00:07.470> brushes<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.040> sponges

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
stippling brushes and sponges

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
stippling brushes and sponges
some<00:00:09.150> people<00:00:09.389> think<00:00:09.510> they're<00:00:09.690> actually<00:00:09.929> quite

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
some people think they're actually quite

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.259 
some people think they're actually quite
similar<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.219> suppose<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.610> too<00:00:11.910> because

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
similar and I suppose I do too because

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.140 
similar and I suppose I do too because
really<00:00:12.540> interesting<00:00:13.139> effects<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.650> them

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
really interesting effects with them

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.340 
really interesting effects with them
this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.360> area<00:00:15.599> I've<00:00:15.719> done<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this is an area I've done with a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is an area I've done with a
stippling<00:00:16.650> brush<00:00:17.869> that's<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.050> area<00:00:19.710> just

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
stippling brush that's this area just

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.420 
stippling brush that's this area just
here

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
here

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.890 
here
and<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.689> move<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.859> sponge

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
and now I'm going to move on to a sponge

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.089 
and now I'm going to move on to a sponge
this<00:00:24.900> sponge<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.410> actually<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.830> quite<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
this sponge has actually got quite a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.490 
this sponge has actually got quite a
smooth<00:00:26.789> texture<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:27.960> area<00:00:28.230> here

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
smooth texture on it and this area here

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
smooth texture on it and this area here
was<00:00:28.619> done<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.039> sponge<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.359> going

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
was done with that sponge I'm just going

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.970 
was done with that sponge I'm just going
to<00:00:30.510> continue<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.080> area<00:00:31.439> along

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.710 

like<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.060> has<00:00:41.210> got<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.390> quite<00:00:41.690> a

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
like that and this has got a quite a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.500 
like that and this has got a quite a
coarse<00:00:42.790> underside<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.390> we're<00:00:44.480> just

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
coarse underside to it so we're just

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.380 
coarse underside to it so we're just
going<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.870> get<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.590> course<00:00:45.830> effect<00:00:46.250> now<00:00:46.520> I'm

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
going to get the course effect now I'm

00:00:47.390 --> 00:01:01.459 
going to get the course effect now I'm
just<00:00:47.570> turning<00:00:47.750> over

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.640 

that's<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.579> area<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that's a very area there as you can see

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.609 
that's a very area there as you can see
this<00:01:04.799> whole<00:01:05.309> piece<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> masked<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this whole piece is masked off so that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
this whole piece is masked off so that
when<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> finish<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.970> take<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> masking

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
when we finish this and take the masking

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
when we finish this and take the masking
tape<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.259> we'll<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.950> left<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> really

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
tape off and we'll be left with a really

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
tape off and we'll be left with a really
interesting<00:01:12.450> effect<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.909> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
interesting effect and it will all be in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.580 
interesting effect and it will all be in
squares<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:17.659> that's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.899> good<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
squares now that's a good way of doing a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.310 
squares now that's a good way of doing a
window<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> sponge<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.630> quite<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.229> open

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
window now this sponge is quite an open

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.289 
window now this sponge is quite an open
poured<00:01:22.799> sponge<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> area<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.210> has

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
poured sponge and that area there has

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.370 
poured sponge and that area there has
been<00:01:24.420> done<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.690> this<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
been done with this one so I'm just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
been done with this one so I'm just
gonna<00:01:25.500> pick<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.040> color<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.149> go

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
lastly on this piece I'm going to use a

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.300 
lastly on this piece I'm going to use a
natural<00:02:01.570> sponge<00:02:01.840> which<00:02:02.320> again<00:02:02.829> will<00:02:03.009> leave

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
natural sponge which again will leave

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.600 
natural sponge which again will leave
more<00:02:03.640> open<00:02:04.090> Lord<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:05.439> this<00:02:05.619> area<00:02:05.890> here<00:02:06.310> has

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
more open Lord and this area here has

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:20.990 
more open Lord and this area here has
been<00:02:06.790> done<00:02:06.970> using<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.509> sponge

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.090 

another<00:02:21.690> thing<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.680> mask

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
another thing that you can do is mask

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.550 
another thing that you can do is mask
off<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.820> glass<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.390> we've<00:02:24.540> chosen<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.110> spiral

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
off a glass and we've chosen a spiral

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.040 
off a glass and we've chosen a spiral
type<00:02:25.800> effect<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.930> you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
type effect with this one and then you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.100 
type effect with this one and then you
can<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.350> sponge<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.190> between<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.390> masking

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
can just sponge in between the masking

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.470 
can just sponge in between the masking
tape<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> paint<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> effect<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
tape with the paint and the effect that

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.390 
tape with the paint and the effect that
we're<00:02:33.570> looking<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.100> glass

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
we're looking for is like this glass

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:53.830 
we're looking for is like this glass
here

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.140 

and<00:02:54.840> once<00:02:55.020> your<00:02:55.170> windows<00:02:55.470> section<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.950> dry<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and once your windows section is dry you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.420 
and once your windows section is dry you
can<00:02:57.360> pull<00:02:57.630> off<00:02:57.930> masking<00:02:58.560> tape<00:02:58.770> but<00:02:59.130> try<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
can pull off masking tape but try and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.350 
can pull off masking tape but try and
keep<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.880> close<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.090> glass<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
keep it close to the glass or the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.700 
keep it close to the glass or the
plastic<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.870> you're<00:03:03.990> pulling<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.470> and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
plastic that you're pulling it from and

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.400 
plastic that you're pulling it from and
that<00:03:04.800> way<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.070> get<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.340> nice<00:03:05.640> clean<00:03:06.300> line<00:03:06.750> as

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
that way you get a nice clean line as

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.640 
that way you get a nice clean line as
you<00:03:07.530> pulled<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.860> off

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
you pulled it off

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.560 
you pulled it off
if<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.770> try<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.100> pull<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> tape<00:03:11.910> up<00:03:12.120> too<00:03:12.330> far

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
if you try and pull the tape up too far

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
if you try and pull the tape up too far
in<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> air<00:03:13.020> it'll<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.680> give<00:03:14.070> attracted

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
in the air it'll actually give attracted

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.470 
in the air it'll actually give attracted
finish<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.410> way<00:03:16.620> you'll<00:03:16.800> get<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.010> nice

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
finish and this way you'll get a nice

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.110 
finish and this way you'll get a nice
clean<00:03:18.480> line<00:03:19.190> like<00:03:20.360> that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
clean line like that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.630 
clean line like that
now<00:03:23.780> as<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.590> look<00:03:24.620> at<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.129> can<00:03:25.190> see<00:03:25.519> all

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
now as you look at that you can see all

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.949 
now as you look at that you can see all
the<00:03:25.730> different<00:03:26.030> textures<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.569> all<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the different textures of all the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.949 
the different textures of all the
sponges<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.860> brushes<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.819> used<00:03:29.209> when<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
sponges and brushes that I used when I

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.630 
sponges and brushes that I used when I
was<00:03:30.110> making<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.590> piece<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:32.860> likewise<00:03:33.860> you

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
was making that piece and likewise you

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.270 
was making that piece and likewise you
can<00:03:34.790> see<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.890> similar<00:03:37.220> effects<00:03:37.489> with<00:03:37.760> this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
can see the similar effects with this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.720 
can see the similar effects with this
and<00:03:40.280> again<00:03:40.610> just<00:03:41.090> pull<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.450> close<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:43.610> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
and again just pull it close to the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.130 
and again just pull it close to the
glass<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.629> you're<00:03:44.720> actually<00:03:44.810> getting

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
glass so that you're actually getting

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.690 
glass so that you're actually getting
nice<00:03:45.890> clean<00:03:46.459> lines<00:03:46.909> as<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.360> go<00:03:47.540> around
