00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.670
 good do not you know how does a certain 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.480
 in the prolific pink ear 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.779
 you can see that his ear has also fallen 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 and to begin with I have separated three paragraphs 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.810
 two or more of the same size and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810
 a little bigger 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.130
 here you will use it for you know where 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 You'll fold in the right place. 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.219
 you will pick up point for the ear to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.179
 behind it make a fold 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:00.149
 here is not where you go 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:03.030
 do is put the tape to do so well 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.650
 over the fold government that can not 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.220
 Tighten the tone and end only 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.220
 hold tight 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:26.840
 and in the end you stick it right and 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:28.610
 she's going to stay like this to the side is to 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.789
 power to break into the right place if you 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.490
 leave so it will break to the middle 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.729
 and will do three folds here in the ear 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.479
 well then it will get broken wrong 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:47.030
 so it breaks in the right place to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.459
 I went back there is the same 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.990
 safe thing on the tip of the ear went to 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:59.450
 behind where it broke and put it in the same 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.659
 She broke opera and put 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.780
 up the wave she broke it broke 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.780
 more in the right place possible 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.209
 affected good technical level closer 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:33.310
 her to stay like this until now and it will break 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:39.550
 wrong is that you are going to do the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.310
 Yes, he's going to leave it here. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.340
 tip out and will measure more or 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.030
 the height of his head so the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.580
 author no distance will put 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.380
 it is also very closed but neither is 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.549
 very open being will look at the time goes 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:11.310
 measure right 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:11.310
 here is only you to sell without affecting too 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.880
 and now the ear 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.830
 as it already begins it is already in the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.710
 shape right and break 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:33.570
 Then you leave about three days four days. 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.120
 and when you take it out you still need 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.860
 to do it will not be broken in the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.770
 wrong place maybe she's a little 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.530
 High , you only have to do that first cut. 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.440
 which is to fold in the right place there 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 You put paragraph with the weight it falls.
