00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.510 

we<00:02:54.680> look<00:02:54.890> at<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:56.500> point<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.980> where<00:02:58.280> you're

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
we look at the point here where you're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.360 
we look at the point here where you're
you're<00:02:58.850> you're<00:02:59.240> splitting<00:02:59.600> back<00:02:59.980> now<00:03:00.980> as<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you're you're splitting back now as the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.490 
you're you're splitting back now as the
four<00:03:01.610> starts<00:03:01.940> come<00:03:02.150> back<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.570> me<00:03:02.780> that's

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
four starts come back in on me that's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.160 
four starts come back in on me that's
when<00:03:03.770> I'm<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.210> catch<00:03:05.210> him<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.050> he

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
when I'm going to catch him so he

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.780 
when I'm going to catch him so he
reverses<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.830> muscles<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> spinners

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
reverses the muscles and the spinners

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.900 
reverses the muscles and the spinners
back<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.810> analysis<00:03:09.200> comes<00:03:09.470> forward<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.340> I

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
back the analysis comes forward and I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.490 
back the analysis comes forward and I
cut<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.210> off<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.570> i'll<00:03:11.630> drive<00:03:11.780> towards<00:03:12.290> him

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
cut it off and i'll drive towards him

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.660 
cut it off and i'll drive towards him
you<00:03:13.310> split<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.220> use<00:03:16.430> this

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
you split you can you can use this

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.480 
you split you can you can use this
energy<00:03:16.910> here<00:03:17.480> hold<00:03:18.050> this<00:03:18.200> hip<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.740> pull<00:03:19.070> my<00:03:19.220> OG

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
energy here hold this hip and pull my OG

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.460 
energy here hold this hip and pull my OG
out<00:03:21.100> jun<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.850> order<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.360> me<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.540> if<00:03:23.990> he's

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
out jun in order for me to if he's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.100 
out jun in order for me to if he's
hooked<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.700> as<00:03:25.880> he<00:03:26.000> does<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.209> i<00:03:26.570> need<00:03:27.080> to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
hooked in in as he does that i need to

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.820 
hooked in in as he does that i need to
split<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.709> energy<00:03:28.070> after<00:03:32.260> he<00:03:33.260> struct<00:03:33.620> into

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
split that energy after he struct into

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.650 
split that energy after he struct into
my<00:03:33.980> through<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.670> i<00:03:34.730> think<00:03:34.970> i<00:03:35.180> could<00:03:35.450> roll

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
my through it so i think i could roll

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:48.910 
my through it so i think i could roll
them<00:03:35.780> out<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.370> then<00:03:40.840> keep<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:43.060> rich

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.870 

so

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:02.200 

any<00:03:54.820> he<00:03:55.820> holding<00:03:56.780> points<00:03:57.170> inside<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.620> body<00:04:01.210> to

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
any he holding points inside the body to

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.720 
any he holding points inside the body to
hold<00:04:05.110> very<00:04:06.110> very<00:04:06.500> softly<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.220> say<00:04:07.550> if<00:04:07.640> I've

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
hold very very softly so I say if I've

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.080 
hold very very softly so I say if I've
got<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.060> point<00:04:08.390> there<00:04:08.600> he<00:04:09.320> drops<00:04:09.470> his<00:04:09.740> hip

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
got that point there he drops his hip

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.210 
got that point there he drops his hip
stretches<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:12.200> goes<00:04:12.500> into<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:12.920> energy

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
stretches that goes into the energy

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.910 
stretches that goes into the energy
field<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.640> splits<00:04:14.000> me<00:04:14.180> off<00:04:14.270> when<00:04:14.480> engine

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
field and splits me off when engine

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.360 
field and splits me off when engine
septum<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.970> he<00:04:17.150> found<00:04:18.110> a<00:04:18.230> holding<00:04:18.709> point<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.100> I

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
septum so he found a holding point it I

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.430 
septum so he found a holding point it I
have<00:04:19.730> to<00:04:19.880> relax<00:04:20.120> down<00:04:20.360> cover<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:20.870> hand<00:04:21.140> and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
have to relax down cover this hand and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.120 
have to relax down cover this hand and
then<00:04:25.180> wherever<00:04:26.180> there's<00:04:26.570> this<00:04:26.810> some<00:04:27.140> catching

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
then wherever there's this some catching

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.400 
then wherever there's this some catching
point<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.880> put<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.150> bit<00:04:29.330> NGM<00:04:29.720> catching<00:04:30.110> point

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
point you put a bit NGM catching point

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.190 
point you put a bit NGM catching point
and<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:31.670> wouldn't<00:04:32.060> answer<00:04:32.300> your<00:04:32.540> partner<00:04:33.080> to

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
and you wouldn't answer your partner to
