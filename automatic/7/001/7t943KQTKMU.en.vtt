00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome to murder 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.500
 Tutorial video and that I show you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.019
 like your own minecraft mod for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.269
 the version 1.6 point 2 can create 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.370
 you only need a few files for this 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.690
 from the internet and that we need 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.430
 once the jetpack and the j apax me 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 will show you first the download so all 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.359
 left is in the video description we 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.340
 kick on the blue download button 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.870
 a little bit a little on the internet 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 Today is a very bad me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
 I do not know why but now 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 first of all it does not matter and we click then 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 here on exact license agreement the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.370
 we have to do otherwise we can 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.180
 do not download a file 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 Here he is still looking for one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 operating system out I guess 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 Every one of you knows what kind 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.600
 he operating system has so here it is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 linux solaris and windows if you want the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.239
 a windows 32 if you have a windows 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.699
 32 bit operating system then have to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.519
 you download the windows x86 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.330
 with a 64 bit operating system 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.340
 you download the windows x64 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 but that's the case with most computers 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.040
 So somehow preinstalled at 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.820
 In any case it was like that for me 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 some of you know step by step 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 actually skip that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 only incidentally and now come to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.689
 mainly that minecraft 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 kodak or motto or pack 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.030
 this is the official site 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.040
 as far as I know 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 here you just have to download 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 click minecraft and look for it now 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.549
 you get a file out the best the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 mct 8:05 the 8:11 that's for you 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.159
 1.6 point 4 there are problems 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 or there are often problems 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 That's why I'm doing a tutorial now 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:04.009
 for the 1.6.2010 8:05 scroll namely 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.509
 Click on this blue arrow 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.780
 now if it gets to now if we are too 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.340
 a mega celebration page forwarded 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 Just click here then we would have that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.520
 also done 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.400
 I already did that then 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.860
 we will need a file now 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.350
 We have a new folder for this 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 we do on other desktop 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:31.950
 right-click new folder the folder can 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.500
 call her what you want to call me in 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.280
 which now times mod pull here the mcp 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.310
 now also the pure or one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.580
 does he need a program with yes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.010
 I can recommend the file unpack 7 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.350
 zip or winrar I take in the previous year 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 He just right-click on 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.880
 the file on it clicks on the unpack 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.190
 us when all the parties in 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.620
 this file is in here 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.970
 folder we could pack this 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.530
 theoretically delete so you see 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 already in the partner are here a few 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.850
 batch files and a few others 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 Files ds have files located at the beginning 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.350
 me now on the compiler then 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.709
 opens a window here you see 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.150
 you know it's for the 16.2 already 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.209
 Now here are a few files 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.250
 created that lasts now in the moment and 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.480
 That's why I'm taking a break now 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.020
 So we'll see you soon if that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.700
 process is complete is so and there 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.790
 the consequence nevertheless closed after 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.959
 just under ten minutes or so is then 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.430
 we're done just press 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.690
 any key so ekstrÃ¶m i'm high 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.959
 already have a few here 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.670
 new folders are made to the folders themselves 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.790
 but later, what they are, namely, in 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.989
 the next episode important as I do not 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.780
 and yes it was not quite the water 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.680
 and that's what I do 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.680
 start to go 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.440
 So far , I still work 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.270
 I have until the board a tutorial 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.710
 made for the entry 6.4 but there 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.200
 There was then this problem 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.200
 and yes you see the first here 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.040
 1.6.2011 everything so and we would have 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.270
 that actually done in the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.100
 I will follow you next 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.710
 Show how you have your own blog 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.490
 I hope it has you 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.590
 like 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.210
 Look at the next video 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.980
 and the videos after that and always like that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.710
 continue because the tour torpedo the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.600
 tutorial series will be long that 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.660
 I promise you and I hope so 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.010
 get the end yet before the 1.7 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.940
 out is because then certainly still 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.260
 such a tutorial 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.340
 maybe something has changed 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.660
 first little look and then 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.890
 I decide later but we have 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.150
 I still think time up to 1,700 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.540
 rainhard the beautiful day and until 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.540
 next time
