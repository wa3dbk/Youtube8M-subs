on<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.830> route<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.490> um<00:02:53.820> those<00:02:54.720> are<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.020> two

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
on that go route so um those are the two

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.890 
on that go route so um those are the two
me<00:02:55.530> some<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> major<00:02:56.610> attributes<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.720> guy

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
me some of the major attributes of a guy

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800 
me some of the major attributes of a guy
like<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.500> Sammy<00:02:58.860> Watkins<00:02:59.250> he's<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.420> ideal

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
like a Sammy Watkins he's not the ideal

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
like a Sammy Watkins he's not the ideal
height<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.320> ideal<00:03:01.620> weight<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.220> stud<00:03:02.610> number

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
height and ideal weight of a stud number

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.600 
height and ideal weight of a stud number
one<00:03:03.209> receiver<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.020> NFL<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.520> are<00:03:05.550> a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
one receiver in the NFL but there are a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.120 
one receiver in the NFL but there are a
lot<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.820> guys<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.690> could<00:03:06.990> rattle<00:03:07.200> off<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
lot of guys that I could rattle off that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.430 
lot of guys that I could rattle off that
maybe<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> ideal<00:03:09.330> height<00:03:10.080> speed

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
maybe don't have the ideal height speed

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
maybe don't have the ideal height speed
and<00:03:10.800> weight<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.670> been<00:03:11.820> extremely<00:03:12.390> good

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
and weight but have been extremely good

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.810 
and weight but have been extremely good
receivers<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.320> NFL<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:14.040> guess<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
receivers in the NFL I guess the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.300 
receivers in the NFL I guess the
difference<00:03:15.209> between<00:03:15.350> ranking<00:03:16.350> Watkins<00:03:16.920> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
difference between ranking Watkins you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
difference between ranking Watkins you
know<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> 10th<00:03:17.820> or<00:03:17.970> 11th<00:03:18.360> best<00:03:18.570> player<00:03:18.840> in

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
know the 10th or 11th best player in

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.290 
know the 10th or 11th best player in
this<00:03:19.200> class<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.070> third<00:03:20.550> fourth<00:03:20.850> or<00:03:21.000> fifth

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
this class or the third fourth or fifth

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.150 
this class or the third fourth or fifth
best<00:03:21.540> player<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.050> class<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:23.010> you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
best player in this class is if you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.190 
best player in this class is if you
think<00:03:23.459> he<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.000> stud<00:03:24.630> number<00:03:24.989> one

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
think he can be that stud number one

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.440 
think he can be that stud number one
ride<00:03:25.440> wide<00:03:25.739> receiver<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.970> happen<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.360> think

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
ride wide receiver and I happen to think

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.780 
ride wide receiver and I happen to think
he<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.739> that's<00:03:28.950> why<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.160> have<00:03:29.610> him

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
he can be that so that's why I have him

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.360 
he can be that so that's why I have him
as<00:03:29.970> my<00:03:30.000> top-rated<00:03:30.360> receiver<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.980> draft

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.699 
as my top-rated receiver in this draft
and<00:03:32.670> i<00:03:33.450> flopped<00:03:33.989> between<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> fifth<00:03:34.590> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
and i flopped between the fifth and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.220 
and i flopped between the fifth and
sixth<00:03:35.040> best<00:03:35.220> player<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.209> draft<00:03:36.450> overall<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
sixth best player in the draft overall I

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.840 
sixth best player in the draft overall I
think<00:03:37.290> he<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.100> number<00:03:38.400> one<00:03:38.550> receiver

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
think he can be that number one receiver

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.320 
think he can be that number one receiver
at<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.330> next<00:03:39.570> level<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.940> again<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.060> because

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
at the next level and again it's because

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.640 
at the next level and again it's because
of<00:03:42.360> his<00:03:42.570> versatility<00:03:43.049> he<00:03:43.350> can<00:03:43.470> play<00:03:43.590> in

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
of his versatility he can play in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.270 
of his versatility he can play in
virtually<00:03:44.130> any<00:03:44.280> scheme<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.660> also

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
virtually any scheme and and also

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.710 
virtually any scheme and and also
because<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.430> fact<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.600> guy

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
because of the fact that this is a guy

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.300 
because of the fact that this is a guy
who<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.959> tremendously<00:03:49.530> productive<00:03:49.830> in

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
who was tremendously productive in

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.370 
who was tremendously productive in
college<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.330> way<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.260> little

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
college and I way that I think a little

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.350 
college and I way that I think a little
bit<00:03:52.530> higher<00:03:52.739> than<00:03:52.769> everyone<00:03:53.310> else<00:03:53.519> now<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.239> he

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
bit higher than everyone else now if he

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060 
bit higher than everyone else now if he
had<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.510> big<00:03:54.780> deficiency<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.470> his<00:03:55.620> game<00:03:55.830> where

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
had a big deficiency in his game where

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.120 
had a big deficiency in his game where
he<00:03:56.100> dropped<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.580> lot<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.850> passes<00:03:57.390> or<00:03:57.890> he<00:03:58.890> didn't

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
he dropped a lot of passes or he didn't

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.009 
he dropped a lot of passes or he didn't
run<00:03:59.310> routes<00:03:59.610> well<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.540> guy<00:04:00.690> who<00:04:00.720> runs

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
run routes well this is a guy who runs

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.960 
run routes well this is a guy who runs
solid<00:04:01.590> routes<00:04:01.799> again<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.430> run<00:04:02.610> them<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:02.850> all

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
solid routes again it's run them at all

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.840 
solid routes again it's run them at all
three<00:04:03.239> levels<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.750> college<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:05.130> guy<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.820> I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
three levels in college and a guy that I

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.430 
three levels in college and a guy that I
think<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.360> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.690> be<00:04:06.720> productive<00:04:07.080> at<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
think is going to be productive at the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860 
think is going to be productive at the
next<00:04:07.799> level<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.940> your<00:04:09.180> team<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.480> runs<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
next level and if your team that runs a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.680 
next level and if your team that runs a
dynamic<00:04:10.380> offense<00:04:10.860> different<00:04:11.640> sets<00:04:11.910> bubble

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
dynamic offense different sets bubble

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.190 
dynamic offense different sets bubble
screens<00:04:13.580> things<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.850> nature<00:04:15.200> Sammy

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
screens things of that nature Sammy

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900 
screens things of that nature Sammy
Watkins<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> guy<00:04:16.979> they<00:04:17.220> should<00:04:17.430> look<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.609> add

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
Watkins is a guy they should look to add

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.120 
Watkins is a guy they should look to add
again<00:04:18.660> I'm<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.109> too<00:04:19.290> caught<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.859> fact

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
again I'm not too caught up in the fact

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.870 
again I'm not too caught up in the fact
that<00:04:20.370> he's<00:04:20.729> not<00:04:20.910> 63<00:04:21.780> 220<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.740> rank<00:04:23.460> him<00:04:23.610> ahead<00:04:23.729> of

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
that he's not 63 220 I rank him ahead of

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.430 
that he's not 63 220 I rank him ahead of
Mike<00:04:24.150> Evans<00:04:24.419> because<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.810> think<00:04:25.020> he's<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.169> lot

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
Mike Evans because I think he's a lot

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.010 
Mike Evans because I think he's a lot
more<00:04:25.470> polished<00:04:26.220> than<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:27.000> Mike<00:04:27.240> Evans<00:04:27.479> is<00:04:27.780> at

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
more polished than a Mike Evans is at

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.719 
more polished than a Mike Evans is at
this<00:04:28.139> point<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.560> time<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.610> guy

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
this point in time so that's the guy

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.460 
this point in time so that's the guy
he's<00:04:29.910> usually<00:04:30.120> compared<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.110> draft

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
he's usually compared to in this draft

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.740 
he's usually compared to in this draft
but<00:04:31.770> that's<00:04:32.220> my<00:04:32.430> take<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.819> Sammy<00:04:33.090> Watkins<00:04:33.419> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
but that's my take on Sammy Watkins the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.999 
but that's my take on Sammy Watkins the
wide<00:04:33.900> receiver<00:04:34.349> again<00:04:34.560> from<00:04:34.770> clenching

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
wide receiver again from clenching

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.159 
wide receiver again from clenching
