00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
what we're here at the coffee planet

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
what we're here at the coffee planet
facility<00:00:05.460> here<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.670> Chapel<00:00:05.970> Ali<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.779> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
facility here in Chapel Ali this is

facility here in Chapel Ali this is
roastmaster<00:00:07.259> ma<00:00:07.770> who's<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> show<00:00:08.910> us

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
roastmaster ma who's going to show us

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:31.120 
roastmaster ma who's going to show us
around<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.420> incredible<00:00:09.900> place

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.610 

we'll<00:00:31.970> do<00:00:32.150> a<00:00:32.180> lot<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.450> test<00:00:32.689> batches<00:00:32.930> first<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
we'll do a lot of test batches first to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.040 
we'll do a lot of test batches first to
get<00:00:33.770> exactly<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.340> right<00:00:34.510> rose<00:00:35.510> profile

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
get exactly the right rose profile

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.160 
get exactly the right rose profile
because<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.730> where<00:00:37.940> we<00:00:38.180> now<00:00:38.780> can

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
because this is where we now can

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.310 
because this is where we now can
influence<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.890> flavor<00:00:40.160> of<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.460> coffee<00:00:40.810> so<00:00:41.810> we

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
influence the flavor of the coffee so we

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.800 
influence the flavor of the coffee so we
had<00:00:42.470> cut<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:43.010> we've<00:00:43.220> tasted<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.910> we've<00:00:44.510> worked

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
had cut it we've tasted it we've worked

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.690 
had cut it we've tasted it we've worked
out<00:00:45.080> exactly<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.860> characteristics<00:00:46.370> of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
out exactly what the characteristics of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.060 
out exactly what the characteristics of
that<00:00:46.760> coffee<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.270> now<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:48.110> want<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.620> enhance

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
that coffee is now we want to enhance

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.090 
that coffee is now we want to enhance
that<00:00:49.460> as<00:00:49.610> much<00:00:49.850> as<00:00:50.030> possible<00:00:50.470> so<00:00:51.470> let's<00:00:51.500> say

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
that as much as possible so let's say

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.820 
that as much as possible so let's say
like<00:00:52.940> today<00:00:53.270> we're<00:00:53.450> roasting<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.960> mariachi

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
like today we're roasting a mariachi

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.790 
like today we're roasting a mariachi
coffee<00:00:55.250> from<00:00:55.610> Mexico

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
coffee from Mexico

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.380 
coffee from Mexico
it's<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.309> said<00:00:58.550> it's<00:00:58.670> really<00:00:58.970> high

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
it's like I said it's really high

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.510 
it's like I said it's really high
altitude<00:01:00.199> like<00:01:00.379> right<00:01:00.650> up<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.040> mountains

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
altitude like right up in the mountains

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.990 
altitude like right up in the mountains
so<00:01:02.390> it's<00:01:02.510> really<00:01:02.690> dense<00:01:03.489> things<00:01:04.489> which<00:01:04.820> means

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
so it's really dense things which means

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.480 
so it's really dense things which means
it's<00:01:05.210> got<00:01:05.360> really<00:01:05.600> bright<00:01:05.870> clean<00:01:06.490> juicy

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's got really bright clean juicy

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.950 
it's got really bright clean juicy
acidity<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.720> enhance<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.979> will<00:01:10.960> cut

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
acidity so to enhance that I will cut

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.010 
acidity so to enhance that I will cut
the<00:01:12.080> roast<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:12.740> little<00:01:13.190> bit<00:01:13.460> shorter<00:01:13.970> speed<00:01:14.840> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the roast a little bit shorter speed it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.140 
the roast a little bit shorter speed it
up<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.840> make<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.620> quite<00:01:18.860> sudden<00:01:19.340> finish

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
up and and make it quite sudden finish

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.780 
up and and make it quite sudden finish
and<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.570> will<00:01:20.720> enhance<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.370> fruitiness

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
and that will enhance the the fruitiness

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.090 
and that will enhance the the fruitiness
of<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.150> coffee<00:01:23.360> okay<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.350> sort<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.620> different

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
of the coffee okay so sort of different

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.640 
of the coffee okay so sort of different
techniques<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.520> we<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.850> do<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.810> okay<00:01:27.620> so

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
techniques that we can do so okay so

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.590 
techniques that we can do so okay so
what<00:01:27.979> we<00:01:28.070> do<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.310> first<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.150> all<00:01:29.210> we'll<00:01:29.360> put<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
what we do is first of all we'll put the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.499 
what we do is first of all we'll put the
coffee<00:01:29.810> in

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.350 

so<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.600> goes<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> poplar<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> top

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.999 

and<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.479> can<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.810> their<00:01:39.049> green<00:01:39.350> coffee<00:01:39.770> up

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
and you can see their green coffee up

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.050 
and you can see their green coffee up
here<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:42.380> next<00:01:42.649> part<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.310> we'll<00:01:43.610> get<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
here so the next part is we'll get the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.149 
here so the next part is we'll get the
drum<00:01:44.719> up<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.380> temperature<00:01:46.159> by<00:01:47.470> pushing<00:01:48.470> gas

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
drum up to temperature by pushing gas

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.450 
drum up to temperature by pushing gas
flames<00:01:49.520> from<00:01:49.850> underneath<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:51.679> then<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.250> will

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
flames from underneath and then I will

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.319 
flames from underneath and then I will
drop<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.119> coffee<00:01:53.329> in<00:01:54.549> what<00:01:55.549> we<00:01:55.670> do<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.060> run

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
drop the coffee in what we do is we run

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.590 
drop the coffee in what we do is we run
on<00:01:56.509> time<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.470> temperature<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:59.030> observe<00:01:59.420> this

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
on time and temperature so observe this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.950 
on time and temperature so observe this
is<00:01:59.780> quite<00:01:59.990> low<00:02:00.170> fire<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.979> stopwatch

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
is quite low fire going stopwatch

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.440 
is quite low fire going stopwatch
plastic<00:02:02.960> step<00:02:03.229> blood<00:02:03.880> but<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.970> temperature

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
plastic step blood but the temperature

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.199 
plastic step blood but the temperature
is<00:02:05.479> running<00:02:05.810> off<00:02:05.929> of<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.280> probe<00:02:07.280> going<00:02:07.700> into<00:02:08.090> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
is running off of a probe going into the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.749 
is running off of a probe going into the
drum<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.170> very<00:02:09.410> accurate<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.220> this

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
drum so it's very accurate and this

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.160 
drum so it's very accurate and this
actually<00:02:11.120> gives<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.360> spoon<00:02:11.630> temperature

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
actually gives a spoon temperature

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.539 
actually gives a spoon temperature
because<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.349> beans<00:02:12.680> are<00:02:12.890> being<00:02:13.040> tossed<00:02:13.250> over

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
because the beans are being tossed over

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.630 
because the beans are being tossed over
the<00:02:13.880> over<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.510> point<00:02:15.220> look<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> giant

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the over this point look like a giant

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.120 
the over this point look like a giant
cement<00:02:17.000> mixer<00:02:17.269> in<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.510> goes<00:02:17.690> fit<00:02:18.230> yeah<00:02:19.099> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
cement mixer in that goes fit yeah I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.580 
cement mixer in that goes fit yeah I
guess<00:02:19.549> yeah<00:02:20.239> exactly<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.170> difference

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
guess yeah exactly but the difference

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.190 
guess yeah exactly but the difference
between<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.459> giant<00:02:22.790> cement<00:02:23.299> mixer<00:02:24.310> is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
between this and a giant cement mixer is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.900 
between this and a giant cement mixer is
inside<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.890> have<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.099> series<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:29.620> paddles<00:02:30.620> now<00:02:31.579> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
inside we have a series of paddles now a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.110 
inside we have a series of paddles now a
lot<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> people<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.370> roasting<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.700> by

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
lot of people think that roasting is by

Badgley it's noise by pushing air hot
air<00:02:38.900> over<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.530> beans<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.549> these<00:02:40.819> things<00:02:41.239> act

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
air over the beans so these things act

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.180 
air over the beans so these things act
like<00:02:41.660> hands<00:02:42.140> inside<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.739> they're<00:02:42.859> juggling

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
like hands inside and they're juggling

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.009 
like hands inside and they're juggling
the<00:02:43.579> coffee<00:02:43.790> in<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> air<00:02:44.239> flowing<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.810> coffee

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
the coffee in the air flowing the coffee

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.979 
the coffee in the air flowing the coffee
in<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> air<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.859> it's<00:02:46.010> always<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.989> momentum

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
in the air so it's always in a momentum

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:48.880 
in the air so it's always in a momentum
here

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
here

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.040 
here
so<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.850> how<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.050> roast<00:02:51.490> we<00:02:52.490> will

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
so this is how we have we roast we will

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.950 
so this is how we have we roast we will
check<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.200> coffee<00:02:54.410> all<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> time<00:02:55.010> with<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
check the coffee all the time with a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.250 
check the coffee all the time with a
shovel<00:02:56.960> it's<00:02:57.380> called<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> Tryon<00:02:58.130> okay<00:02:59.230> and<00:03:00.230> just

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
shovel it's called a Tryon okay and just

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.190 
shovel it's called a Tryon okay and just
constantly<00:03:01.450> check<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.630> coffee

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
constantly check the coffee

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.280 
constantly check the coffee
we<00:03:03.950> will<00:03:04.160> smell<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:05.060> look<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.960> color

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
we will smell it a look at the color

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.460 
we will smell it a look at the color
changes<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.190> coffee<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:09.260> will

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
changes in the coffee and then that will

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.610 
changes in the coffee and then that will
tell<00:03:09.680> us<00:03:09.860> how<00:03:10.700> what<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.810> with<00:03:12.080> adjusting

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
tell us how what to do with adjusting

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.340 
tell us how what to do with adjusting
the<00:03:12.710> gas<00:03:12.890> either<00:03:13.310> lower<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> flame<00:03:14.150> or<00:03:14.480> by<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
the gas either lower the flame or by the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.810 
the gas either lower the flame or by the
flame

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
flame

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.070 
flame
say<00:03:17.270> so<00:03:17.380> each<00:03:18.380> roast<00:03:19.220> can<00:03:20.120> last<00:03:20.510> anywhere

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
say so each roast can last anywhere

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.620 
say so each roast can last anywhere
between<00:03:21.230> 10<00:03:21.950> minutes<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.640> 20<00:03:23.270> minutes

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
between 10 minutes and 20 minutes

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.660 
between 10 minutes and 20 minutes
depending<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:24.800> kind<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.100> concrete<00:03:25.430> for

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
depending on what kind of concrete for

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:35.980 
depending on what kind of concrete for
their<00:03:25.940> excellent<00:03:33.610> we<00:03:34.610> drop<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.690> into<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
their excellent we drop it into the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.760 
their excellent we drop it into the
cooling<00:03:36.320> tray<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.960> big<00:03:39.440> fan

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
cooling tray and now we have a big fan

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.610 
cooling tray and now we have a big fan
underneath<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:41.020> sucking<00:03:42.020> air<00:03:42.320> through

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
underneath that's sucking air through

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.530 
underneath that's sucking air through
the<00:03:43.130> coffee<00:03:43.340> okay

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the coffee okay

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.809 
the coffee okay
because<00:03:45.170> obviously<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:45.800> we<00:03:45.950> were<00:03:46.129> blowing<00:03:46.640> it

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
because obviously if we were blowing it

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.410 
because obviously if we were blowing it
with<00:03:47.709> local<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.280> would<00:03:49.400> be<00:03:49.610> very<00:03:49.640> very

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
with local but it would be very very

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.229 
with local but it would be very very
clever<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:52.220> now<00:03:52.430> we're<00:03:52.610> just<00:03:52.640> cooling<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
clever so so now we're just cooling the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.089 
clever so so now we're just cooling the
coffee<00:03:53.450> as<00:03:53.660> quickly<00:03:53.900> as<00:03:54.110> possible<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:54.680> it

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
coffee as quickly as possible with it

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.000 
coffee as quickly as possible with it
will<00:03:55.250> cool<00:03:55.430> down<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:55.760> about<00:03:55.849> four<00:03:56.239> minutes<00:03:56.420> and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
will cool down in about four minutes and

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.009 
will cool down in about four minutes and
then<00:03:58.010> we'll<00:03:58.220> enter<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:59.150> out<00:03:59.360> once<00:03:59.569> it's<00:03:59.780> cool

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
then we'll enter this out once it's cool

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.870 
then we'll enter this out once it's cool
and<00:04:00.580> take<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:02.000> packaging<00:04:02.750> area
