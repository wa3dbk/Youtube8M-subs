00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.620
 Fox is an English abbreviation 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.880
 deciphering how dense the point is detached 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.049
 special agents 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.589
 which can be translated into Russian as 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.359
 floating point operations per second 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.609
 that is, you can guess that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.470
 flops are not used in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.969
 capitol technology to characterize it 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.400
 performance 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.630
 indicates the number of transactions with 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 floating point numbers 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.239
 which is capable of producing in one 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.489
 second this or that computer 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.100
 the greater this value is 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.410
 computers more productive 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.950
 determined for each computer 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.960
 experimental usually by 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.000
 run test program 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 which produces a known quantity 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.920
 computing and measured time for 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.750
 which goes to their execution 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.670
 by computer 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.410
 the characteristics of flops 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.130
 is also that it can be calculated 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.270
 in theory 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180
 for example for those still being constructed and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 non-existent computers at that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.210
 time as other features 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 performance is 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.350
 regarding measures 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.060
 evaluated compared to other 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.840
 computer settings 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.620
 But this method, these doubts technology 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.240
 not without flaws 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.119
 the main thing is that under 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.460
 the definition of the concept of floating operations 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.400
 point 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.320
 may be a mass of different concepts 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 significant role in these calculations 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.690
 playing bit this rand 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.940
 on the value can influence 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.740
 performance became memory mayor 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 bandwidth 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.370
 processor environment connections 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.610
 and other factors 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.730
 all this ultimately leads to 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.550
 that the results are obtained on one 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.470
 computer using different programs 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 may differ significantly 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.150
 Moreover, with each new trials 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.540
 different results can be obtained 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.800
 when using even one garyp 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.100
 also for counting 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.650
 maximum number of words for 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.470
 CPU need to consider that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.130
 modern processors in each 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 its not sleeping contains a few 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.230
 execution units of each type 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.920
 including floating operations 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.800
 point 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.560
 working properly 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.829
 and whether can perform more than one operation 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.340
 per beat 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.300
 using the same program for 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.060
 testing various 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.329
 computers 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.659
 the latter value can still be achieved 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.819
 some definiteness flops and 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.569
 use this feature for 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.439
 device comparison 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.659
 despite the large number of significant 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.369
 deficiencies indicator flops 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.219
 continue to burst is used for 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:24.709
 performance evaluation 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.139
 based on results 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.769
 popular then leftovers and nkpak 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.549
 the reason for such popularity 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.980
 due to the first flops 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.749
 is the person absolute 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.399
 and secondly, many tasks 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.809
 engineering science practice in finite 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.459

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.969
 overwhelming majority 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.959
 candidates including supercomputers 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.319
 built on the classic 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.609
 architecture using 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.099
 standard processors 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.189
 allowing use 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.120
 common tester with big 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.679
 authenticity 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.639
 what are the average characteristics 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.709
 performance known calibers 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.019
 expressed in circumvention 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.319
 first computer possessed 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.230
 performance just a few flops 20 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.930
 of which tons and less act built in 1946 m 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.669
 year 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.259
 showed performance in 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.789
 300 flops 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.729
 but naturally with the development of technology and 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.579
 personal aslana order 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.009
 first biocompatible 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.899
 computer generation x-bodies 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:22.659
 her performance 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.269
 about seven force flops 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.480
 pin than 2 processor frequency 300 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.669
 megahertz already fifty megaflops 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.599
 modern dual core 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.859
 the processor for example of him of that core 2 to 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.319
 about 19 egypt focus 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.609
 you can also withdraw performance 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.979
 handheld computers she 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.939
 is about one two megaflops 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.540
 game consoles a few gigaflops 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.559
 obsolete 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.269
 and more than a hundred gigaflops 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.029
 modern ones like you station 3 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.299
 the most powerful supercomputer in our 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.299
 time has performance 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 two and a half is flops 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.180
 expert can measure 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.889
 human brain performance 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.509
 what is easier 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.169
 most likely it will be expressed 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.099
 values ​​of the order of miles or micro focus 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.819
 but it is worth remembering that in relation to 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.829
 person using data personally probably 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:12.859
 incorrectly 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.409
 just by measuring the amount 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.930
 which calculations we can make 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.719
 with anyone work that is produced 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.019
 our brains are much more lightweight than 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.169
 any computer 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.529
 for example coordination of space 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.359
 speech function and how recognition both ska
