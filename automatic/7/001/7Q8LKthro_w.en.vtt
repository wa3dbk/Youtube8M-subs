00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
she was a healthy female then that's the

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.940 
she was a healthy female then that's the
best<00:04:20.660> place<00:04:20.900> for<00:04:21.260> her

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
best place for her

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.880 
think that's when she started to need a
friend<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:28.130> took<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.700> dog
