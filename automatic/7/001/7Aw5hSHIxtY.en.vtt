00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.260
 thought maybe you are interested 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.959
 this theme promotes the accumulation of 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.420
 tomato plants like growth 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.689
 their close relatives of the potatoes 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.970
 case is 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.560
 Tim has tried to 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.810
 first topic seed small 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.410
 pulled tomato plants and in boxes 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.090
 planted 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.250
 These are old days the team is not anymore 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.059
 he now uses one 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.329
 other format all 14 plants were 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.129
 when planting the same size but 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.649
 kim has half of the plants so 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 seven of them another box above 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.460
 set on it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.260
 this had then begun to pile up 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.660
 and with homemade 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.930
 Compost of the horse damn celebrity 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.930
 instead of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.070
 that was a lot of work already 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.070
 pretty tired of watching 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.149
 He has the boxes over a period of time 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.649
 filled by two weeks because he was the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:35.619
 do not plant completely under the earth 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:39.020
 wanted to bury a few weeks later 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.970
 all plants are well just that the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.990
 a little better in the double boxes 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.909
 seem to grow and now end of july 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 we look at the results something 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.240
 more accurate 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.569
 [Music] 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.050
 [Music] 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.239
 the piling has the tomato plants 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.580
 initially no harm done 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.489
 and it has promoted root growth 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.680
 but the reason why they are big 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.079
 might just be related to it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:04.310
 that they are getting more nutrients and 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:06.470
 at sea ​​water very interesting but the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.560
 results are not unique 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.060
 incentive for further attempts 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.060
 may the next gardener jacob
