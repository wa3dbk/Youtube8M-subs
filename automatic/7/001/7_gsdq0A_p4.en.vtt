00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have a rubbing problem try to get in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.120 
have a rubbing problem try to get in
here<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.300> let<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:23.060> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:25.130> put

here and let you see if you can see put

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.970 
here and let you see if you can see put
your<00:00:26.279> point<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:28.410> rubbing<00:00:28.949> right

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
your point to that it's rubbing right

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.359 
your point to that it's rubbing right
there<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> forums<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> talk

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
there so we get on the forums and talk

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
there so we get on the forums and talk
they<00:00:32.730> talked<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.239> doing<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.540> melt<00:00:33.809> mod<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they talked about doing a melt mod so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
they talked about doing a melt mod so
we're<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> try<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> today<00:00:36.020> see

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
we're going to try to do that today see

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
we're going to try to do that today see
how<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.590> comes<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.910> see

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
how well it comes out as you can see

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
how well it comes out as you can see
there's<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.860> ridge<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:42.170> here<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:44.489> forces

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
there's a ridge right here that forces

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
there's a ridge right here that forces
the<00:00:45.300> plastic<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the plastic to come up here this is a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
the plastic to come up here this is a
thermoplastic<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> heat<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
thermoplastic and when you heat it up it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
thermoplastic and when you heat it up it
gets<00:00:50.039> malleable<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> cools<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
gets malleable and then when it cools it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.369 
gets malleable and then when it cools it
hardens<00:00:52.500> again<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> trick<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
hardens again so you can do the trick of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
hardens again so you can do the trick of
using<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.829> heat<00:00:56.579> gun<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.329> our<00:00:57.480> here

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
using a heat gun which we have our here

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.860 
using a heat gun which we have our here
to<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.770> malleable<00:00:59.449> reshape<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to make it malleable reshape it in the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
to make it malleable reshape it in the
form<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> let<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> cool<00:01:02.879> down

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
form that you want it let it cool down

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
form that you want it let it cool down
and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.840> stay<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.010> that's<00:01:05.159> what

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and it will stay there so that's what

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.190 
and it will stay there so that's what
we're<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:10.520> protect<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> tire

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
we're going to try protect the tire

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.170 
we're going to try protect the tire
they're<00:01:13.200> expensive

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.810 

it<00:01:18.180> doesn't<00:01:18.540> take<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:18.780> long<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.640> heat

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it doesn't take very long for the heat

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.180 
it doesn't take very long for the heat
down<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:21.780> fast<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.530> careful

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
down it's very fast so be careful

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.859 
down it's very fast so be careful
because<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> heat<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:23.940> up<00:01:24.120> too<00:01:24.390> much

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
because if you heat it up too much

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.580 
because if you heat it up too much
the<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.550> become<00:01:26.909> too<00:01:27.630> liquid<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> it'll

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the it will become too liquid and it'll

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:49.480 
the it will become too liquid and it'll
pass

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.849 

you<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> hold<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> place<00:01:51.359> until<00:01:51.859> it's

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
you want to hold it in place until it's

00:01:52.859 --> 00:03:22.230 
you want to hold it in place until it's
rolled<00:01:56.840> into<00:01:57.840> its<00:01:58.140> new<00:01:58.350> shape

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.780 

that<00:03:23.240> Ridge<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.510> gone<00:03:23.990> now<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.250> that's<00:03:25.580> not

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
that Ridge is gone now so that's not

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.090 
that Ridge is gone now so that's not
pushing<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.270> plastic<00:03:26.720> out<00:03:26.870> it's<00:03:27.440> actually<00:03:27.620> in

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
pushing the plastic out it's actually in

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.340 
pushing the plastic out it's actually in
and<00:03:28.460> then<00:03:29.360> we're<00:03:29.570> going<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.780> give<00:03:29.960> it<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.140> couple

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
and then we're going to give it a couple

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.260 
and then we're going to give it a couple
I'll<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.800> have<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.130> go<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.400> there<00:03:31.910> there

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
I'll gonna have to go in there there

00:03:32.270 --> 00:04:12.070 
I'll gonna have to go in there there
okay<00:03:32.750> we'll<00:03:33.260> do<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> little<00:03:33.680> bit<00:03:33.800> more

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.810 

the<00:04:12.890> metal<00:04:13.280> under<00:04:13.550> here<00:04:13.730> has<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.060> has<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:15.820> folded

the metal under here has a has a folded

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.280 
the metal under here has a has a folded
over<00:04:17.060> piece<00:04:17.239> right<00:04:17.420> here<00:04:17.510> where<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:18.080> is

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
over piece right here where this is

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.680 
over piece right here where this is
attached<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:19.070> if<00:04:19.820> it's<00:04:19.970> rubbing<00:04:20.390> against

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
attached and if it's rubbing against

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.360 
attached and if it's rubbing against
that<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.260> just<00:04:21.440> take<00:04:21.650> your<00:04:21.709> hammer<00:04:22.070> like

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
that you can just take your hammer like

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.700 
that you can just take your hammer like
we<00:04:22.490> did<00:04:22.670> on<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.910> other<00:04:23.060> side<00:04:23.380> smack<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.650> a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
we did on the other side smack this a

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.710 
we did on the other side smack this a
little<00:04:24.980> bit<00:04:25.190> with<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.550> hammer<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.180> bends

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
little bit with the hammer and it bends

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.250 
little bit with the hammer and it bends
that<00:04:27.250> inside<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.640> little<00:04:29.240> bit<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.750> can't<00:04:30.050> even

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
that inside a little bit you can't even

00:04:30.260 --> 00:05:13.689 
that inside a little bit you can't even
tell<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.710> on<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.860> outside<00:04:31.280> at<00:04:31.400> all

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
I'm gonna use the lead in cotton hammer

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.490 
I'm gonna use the lead in cotton hammer
