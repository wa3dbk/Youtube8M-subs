sitting in front of a computer all day

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.869 
sitting in front of a computer all day
you<00:00:42.899> only<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.590> 1<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> 10<00:00:44.280> chance<00:00:44.340> of

hitting any shot you take so if you aim
at<00:00:46.800> someone<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.579> chance<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> actually

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
at someone the chance of you actually

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.209 
at someone the chance of you actually
killing<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> only<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.680> temel<00:00:49.950> assume

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
killing them is only one in temel assume

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
killing them is only one in temel assume
that<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.489> shots<00:00:50.789> kill<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.020> other<00:00:52.170> two<00:00:52.350> people

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that all shots kill the other two people

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
that all shots kill the other two people
one<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:54.030> chance<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
one of them has a one in two chance of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.639 
one of them has a one in two chance of
shooting<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> presumably<00:00:55.140> he<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> less

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
shooting so presumably he is less

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.410 
shooting so presumably he is less
Bernerd<00:00:55.980> than<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.940> other<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
Bernerd than you and the other one has a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.029 
Bernerd than you and the other one has a
one<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.690> three<00:00:58.020> chance<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.469> shooting<00:00:58.590> probably

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
one in three chance of shooting probably

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
one in three chance of shooting probably
some<00:00:59.219> sort<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> semi<00:00:59.910> nerd<00:01:00.149> maybe<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> geek<00:01:00.660> in

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
some sort of semi nerd maybe a geek in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
some sort of semi nerd maybe a geek in
fact<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.680> let's<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.070> through<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.340> very

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
fact so let's go through that very

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
fact so let's go through that very
quickly<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.090> time<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> 1<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.500> 10

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
quickly one more time you have a 1 in 10

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
quickly one more time you have a 1 in 10
chance<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:05.129> hitting<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.369> shot<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.299> has

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
chance of hitting a shot one of them has

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
chance of hitting a shot one of them has
a<00:01:06.420> 1<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.750> 2<00:01:07.260> times<00:01:07.470> fitness<00:01:07.799> shot<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> third

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a 1 in 2 times fitness shot in the third

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
a 1 in 2 times fitness shot in the third
hasn't<00:01:08.610> 1<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.790> 3<00:01:09.060> chance<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> hitting<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> shot

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
hasn't 1 in 3 chance of hitting a shot

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
hasn't 1 in 3 chance of hitting a shot
now<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.619> each<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.549> shoot<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.090> off<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
now you each have to shoot one off the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.160 
now you each have to shoot one off the
other<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> choice<00:01:13.140> about

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
other you don't have a choice about

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.760 
other you don't have a choice about
shooting<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> shoot<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.770> basically

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
shooting you have to shoot and basically

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
shooting you have to shoot and basically
whoever<00:01:17.009> ends<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.600> last<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.869> alive

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
whoever ends up as the last one alive

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
whoever ends up as the last one alive
I<00:01:19.380> guess<00:01:20.070> wins<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> weird

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I guess wins it's kind of a weird

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.399 
I guess wins it's kind of a weird
situation<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> live

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
situation but you know you get to live

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.969 
situation but you know you get to live
so<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> shoot<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so do you have to shoot first the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
so do you have to shoot first the
question<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.330> shoot<00:01:27.540> keep<00:01:27.840> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
question is where do you shoot keep in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.240 
question is where do you shoot keep in
mind<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> them<00:01:28.530> has<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> 1/2<00:01:29.070> chance

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
mind that one of them has a 1/2 chance

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.060 
mind that one of them has a 1/2 chance
of<00:01:29.689> hitting<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.320> other<00:01:31.470> has<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> 1/3

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
of hitting and the other has a 1/3

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
of hitting and the other has a 1/3

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you do you you just think this through

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
you do you you just think this through
for<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> second<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> details

for a second as you can see the details

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.480 
for a second as you can see the details
on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> screen<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.079> able<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
on the screen so you should be able to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.030 
on the screen so you should be able to
to<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.240> remember<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> information

to you know remember all the information
the<00:01:47.040> answer<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.509> actually<00:01:48.960> correct

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the answer for what is actually correct

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.690 
the answer for what is actually correct
in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> situation<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.040> terms<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> optimizing

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
in the situation in terms of optimizing

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
in the situation in terms of optimizing
your<00:01:50.790> chances<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.350> quite<00:01:52.530> surprising

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
your chances and that's quite surprising

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.850 
your chances and that's quite surprising
and<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> answer<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.259> should<00:01:55.290> shoot<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and the answer is you should shoot to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
and the answer is you should shoot to
miss<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.399> should<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.670> shoot<00:01:56.850> away<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
miss you should just shoot away from the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
miss you should just shoot away from the
two<00:01:57.810> people<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.920> there's<00:01:59.070> no<00:01:59.159> chance<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
two people so there's no chance of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
two people so there's no chance of
hitting<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:01.439> reason<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.829> quite

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
hitting them and the reason is quite

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
hitting them and the reason is quite
cool<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:03.270> shoot<00:02:03.600> someone

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cool if you shoot someone

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660 
cool if you shoot someone
if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.680> shoot<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.430> they're

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
if you shoot one of because they're

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.679 
if you shoot one of because they're
they're<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> shoot<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.600> only

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
they're not going to shoot you you only

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.999 
they're not going to shoot you you only
have<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> one-tenth<00:02:07.320> chance<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> hitting<00:02:07.890> them

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
have a one-tenth chance of hitting them

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
have a one-tenth chance of hitting them
so<00:02:08.129> they're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> shoot<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.759> each<00:02:08.789> other

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so they're going to shoot at each other

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
so they're going to shoot at each other
assuming<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.080> kill<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:11.370> if

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
assuming that you don't kill them now if

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.690 
assuming that you don't kill them now if
you<00:02:12.180> shoot

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
you shoot

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
you shoot
one<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:12.970> them<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.510> kill<00:02:13.720> them<00:02:14.220> that's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
one of them and you kill them that's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.670 
one of them and you kill them that's
gonna<00:02:15.489> leave<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.420> 1v1<00:02:16.840> gunfight<00:02:17.590> with

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
gonna leave you in a 1v1 gunfight with

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
gonna leave you in a 1v1 gunfight with
whoever's<00:02:17.980> left<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.819> person<00:02:19.300> has<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
whoever's left and that person has the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.320 
whoever's left and that person has the
next<00:02:19.810> shot<00:02:20.050> okay<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:21.310> basically<00:02:21.879> end<00:02:22.120> up

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
next shot okay so you basically end up

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.479 
next shot okay so you basically end up
in<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.480> one-on-one<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.830> opponent<00:02:24.340> gang

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
in a one-on-one with the opponent gang

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.360 
in a one-on-one with the opponent gang
to<00:02:24.610> shoot<00:02:24.790> first<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.959> however<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.920> constantly

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
to shoot first if however you constantly

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
to shoot first if however you constantly
shoot<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.730> miss<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.660> other<00:02:28.840> two<00:02:29.110> will<00:02:29.319> shoot

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
shoot to miss the other two will shoot

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.930 
shoot to miss the other two will shoot
each<00:02:29.739> other<00:02:29.890> over<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.550> over<00:02:30.730> again

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
each other over and over again

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
each other over and over again
until<00:02:31.330> one<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.510> them<00:02:31.660> dies<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:32.590> which<00:02:32.830> point

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
until one of them dies at which point

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.199 
until one of them dies at which point
there<00:02:33.130> will<00:02:33.220> still<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.519> one-on-one<00:02:33.819> but

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
there will still be a one-on-one but

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.750 
there will still be a one-on-one but
this<00:02:34.390> time<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:35.170> have<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> first<00:02:35.709> shot<00:02:35.890> so

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
this time you have the first shot so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.309 
this time you have the first shot so
that's<00:02:36.940> basically<00:02:37.239> where<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.510> where<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
that's basically where this where this

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.259 
that's basically where this where this
stems<00:02:38.560> from<00:02:38.620> if<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.010> shoot<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> miss<00:02:39.610> you

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
stems from if you shoot to miss you

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.789 
stems from if you shoot to miss you
guarantee<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.810> eventually<00:02:41.500> you'll<00:02:41.590> end<00:02:41.680> up

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
guarantee that eventually you'll end up

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.530 
guarantee that eventually you'll end up
in<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.950> 1<00:02:42.099> &amp;<00:02:42.250> 1<00:02:42.519> p1<00:02:42.670> sure<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.299> don't<00:02:43.450> know

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
in a 1 &amp; 1 p1 sure and you don't know

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.660 
in a 1 &amp; 1 p1 sure and you don't know
who<00:02:43.629> with<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.920> will<00:02:45.069> end<00:02:45.190> up<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.400> 1v1

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
who with but you will end up in a 1v1

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.130 
who with but you will end up in a 1v1
where<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.090> get<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.360> shoot<00:02:46.510> first<00:02:46.810> which<00:02:47.019> is

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
where you get to shoot first which is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.589 
where you get to shoot first which is
significantly<00:02:47.680> better<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:48.640> than<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.239> 1v1

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
significantly better for you than a 1v1

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.839 
significantly better for you than a 1v1
where<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.080> shoot<00:02:50.230> second<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.640> that's

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
where you get to shoot second so that's

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:52.860 
where you get to shoot second so that's
how<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.060> problem<00:02:52.209> works<00:02:52.450> out<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.630> hope<00:02:52.780> you
