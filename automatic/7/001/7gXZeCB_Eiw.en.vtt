this<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.310> Loki<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:06.060> origami<00:00:06.480> by<00:00:06.810> Aki<00:00:07.350> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this is a Loki with origami by Aki and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.190 
this is a Loki with origami by Aki and
today<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.490> going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.820> make<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.210> basic<00:00:09.809> form

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
today we're going to make the basic form

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.549 
today we're going to make the basic form
for<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> origami<00:00:11.309> bird<00:00:12.200> can<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.259> start<00:00:13.469> with

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
for the origami bird can we start with

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.589 
for the origami bird can we start with
the<00:00:13.650> square<00:00:14.040> sheet<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> paper<00:00:14.460> colored<00:00:15.420> on

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the square sheet of paper colored on

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.250 
the square sheet of paper colored on
just<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.230> side<00:00:16.500> only<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.810> we're<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:19.050> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
just one side only and we're going to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.660 
just one side only and we're going to
fold<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:21.590> in<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.710> rectangle<00:00:24.199> unfold<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.670> hold

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
fold it's in a rectangle unfold it hold

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.009 
fold it's in a rectangle unfold it hold
it<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> rectangle<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> other

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it in the rectangle in the other

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.400 
it in the rectangle in the other
direction

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.190 

hold<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> fold<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.430> Triangle<00:00:38.030> in

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
hold that fold it in the Triangle in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.180 
hold that fold it in the Triangle in
both<00:00:40.200> directions<00:00:43.940> okay<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.980> should

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
both directions okay so now you should

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.250 
both directions okay so now you should
have<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:48.710> two<00:00:51.350> lines<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.670> diagonally<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
have the two lines going diagonally and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
have the two lines going diagonally and
horizontally<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.350> vertically<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> then

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
horizontally and vertically and then

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.650 
horizontally and vertically and then
we're<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.800> rectangle

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
we're going to go back to the rectangle

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.950 
we're going to go back to the rectangle
and<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.780> we're<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.230> fold<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.960> one

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and all we're gonna do is fold it one

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.010 
and all we're gonna do is fold it one
corner<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.869> other

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
corner down like this and on the other

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
corner down like this and on the other
side<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> fold<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.340> corner<00:01:08.670> down

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
side we're going to fold the corner down

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
side we're going to fold the corner down
in<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.119> opposite<00:01:09.750> direction<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.740> looks

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
in the opposite direction so it looks

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.390 
in the opposite direction so it looks
like<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.020> we're<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> get

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
like that and we're going to do is get

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.230 
like that and we're going to do is get
our<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.909> fingers<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> middle<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
our two fingers in the middle here and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.130 
our two fingers in the middle here and
just<00:01:18.259> spread<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.409> apart<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:23.810> fold<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> back

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just spread this apart and fold it back

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.420 
just spread this apart and fold it back
down<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> now<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:28.369> these<00:01:29.369> two

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
down so that now you have these two

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.590 
down so that now you have these two
flaps<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:32.100> end<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.610> open<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
flaps here in one end that's open the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
flaps here in one end that's open the
other<00:01:33.810> end<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> course<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.439> closed<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> with

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
other end of course it's closed and with

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.270 
other end of course it's closed and with
the<00:01:36.720> open<00:01:37.079> end<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:40.280> fold

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the open end here you're going to fold

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.840 
the open end here you're going to fold
one<00:01:41.700> take<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.540> flap<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.259> bring<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
one take one flap and bring it over to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.470 
one take one flap and bring it over to
like<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> kite<00:01:45.479> shape

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.420 

and<00:01:57.140> do<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> same<00:01:58.470> thing<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:58.950> side

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.630 

we're<00:02:02.430> gonna<00:02:02.580> flip<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> over<00:02:03.120> and<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> same

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
we're gonna flip it over and do the same

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.160 
we're gonna flip it over and do the same
thing<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.240> nice<00:02:09.479> tool<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.550> like

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
thing so we have this nice tool I like

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.840 
thing so we have this nice tool I like
ice<00:02:13.170> cream<00:02:13.470> cones<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:14.760> gonna

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
ice cream cones and then we're gonna

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
ice cream cones and then we're gonna
take<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.960> top<00:02:16.380> part<00:02:16.650> fold<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.130> over<00:02:17.870> like

gonna<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.840> call<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> petal<00:02:22.560> fold<00:02:22.830> on

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
gonna do now is call it petal fold on

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.940 
gonna do now is call it petal fold on
the<00:02:23.340> more<00:02:23.550> complicated<00:02:24.410> things<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.620> origami

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the more complicated things in origami

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.900 
the more complicated things in origami
take<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> two<00:02:27.240> flaps<00:02:27.270> unfold<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.610> take<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
take the two flaps unfold them take the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.570 
take the two flaps unfold them take the
top<00:02:30.390> sheet<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.870> paper<00:02:31.020> only<00:02:31.440> we're<00:02:32.430> gonna

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
top sheet of paper only we're gonna

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.700 
top sheet of paper only we're gonna
bring<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> up<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.360> crease<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:35.180> then

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
bring it up to this crease here and then

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.440 
bring it up to this crease here and then
make<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.740> come<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> nice<00:02:38.400> point<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
make it come to a nice point here and

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
make it come to a nice point here and
then<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.290> fold<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.910> down<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> we're<00:02:44.040> using

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
then just fold this down and we're using

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.490 
then just fold this down and we're using
creases<00:02:44.850> which<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.209> already<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
creases which are already there so it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.740 
creases which are already there so it
comes<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> nice<00:02:50.160> point<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.130> was<00:02:53.750> like

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
comes to a nice point so it was like

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.910 
comes to a nice point so it was like
this<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:56.610> brought<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.180> flap<00:02:57.540> up<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.130> then

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
this we brought this flap up and then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.710 
this we brought this flap up and then
maybe<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.010> come<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> nice<00:03:02.489> point<00:03:02.850> I'm<00:03:03.570> gonna

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
maybe it come to a nice point I'm gonna

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.750 
maybe it come to a nice point I'm gonna
flip<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:03.989> over<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.620> exactly<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.310> same<00:03:05.340> thing

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

on<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> other<00:03:06.000> side<00:03:06.290> open<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:07.800> up

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
on the other side open this up

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.140 
on the other side open this up
bring<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> top<00:03:09.450> sheet<00:03:09.750> only<00:03:09.930> up<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.370> this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
bring the top sheet only up to this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.280 
bring the top sheet only up to this
horizontal<00:03:13.019> line<00:03:13.050> or<00:03:13.769> crease<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:15.390> then<00:03:16.019> make

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
horizontal line or crease and then make

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.860 
horizontal line or crease and then make
it<00:03:16.320> come<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.830> nice<00:03:17.010> points<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.060> fold

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
it come to a nice points and just fold

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.120 
it come to a nice points and just fold
everything<00:03:19.320> down<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.440> careful<00:03:22.830> doesn't

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
everything down to be careful doesn't

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.710 
everything down to be careful doesn't
tear<00:03:23.459> especially<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> top<00:03:24.480> here<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.390> so

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
tear especially at the top here and so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.840 
tear especially at the top here and so
now<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.989> called<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.170> bird<00:03:31.440> base<00:03:31.850> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
now this is called the bird base and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.240 
now this is called the bird base and
you'll<00:03:33.000> notice<00:03:33.180> there's<00:03:33.450> two<00:03:33.750> legs<00:03:34.680> here<00:03:35.070> and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
you'll notice there's two legs here and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.160 
you'll notice there's two legs here and
generally<00:03:38.250> in<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.120> birds<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.480> make<00:03:39.690> these

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
generally in the birds you make these

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.500 
generally in the birds you make these
will<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> wings<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:42.090> will<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
will be the wings and this will be the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.810 
will be the wings and this will be the
head<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.959> will<00:03:43.140> be<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> tail<00:03:43.610> but<00:03:44.610> this

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
head and this will be the tail but this

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.259 
head and this will be the tail but this
is<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.720> base<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.580> make<00:03:47.880> for

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
is the the base that you make for

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.020 
is the the base that you make for
example<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.750> origami<00:03:49.200> crane<00:03:49.940> or<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
example the origami crane or the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.060 
example the origami crane or the
flapping<00:03:51.300> bird<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.350> all<00:03:52.500> different<00:03:52.860> types

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
flapping bird and so all different types

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.820 
flapping bird and so all different types
of<00:03:53.250> birds<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.570> Lackey<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.320> origami

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
of birds this is a Lackey with origami

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.430 
of birds this is a Lackey with origami
by<00:03:56.340> Aki<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.630> that's<00:03:57.810> how<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.050> make<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
by Aki and that's how you make the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.290 
by Aki and that's how you make the
origami<00:03:59.030> bird<00:04:00.030> base

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300
