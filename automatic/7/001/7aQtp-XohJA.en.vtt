00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
inspiration for this was emulate a like

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.220 
inspiration for this was emulate a like
an<00:03:07.250> army<00:03:07.579> boot<00:03:07.819> because<00:03:08.480> they<00:03:08.780> saw<00:03:08.930> LeBron

an army boot because they saw LeBron

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.009 
an army boot because they saw LeBron
James<00:03:09.560> as<00:03:09.829> being<00:03:10.040> six<00:03:10.370> foot<00:03:10.609> eight<00:03:10.700> 250<00:03:11.510> pounds

so he had the power and the speed so

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.789 
so he had the power and the speed so
this<00:03:15.799> was<00:03:16.040> an<00:03:16.190> interpretation<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:20.799> and

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
this was an interpretation of that and
