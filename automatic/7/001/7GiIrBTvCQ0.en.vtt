it's a kind of portmanteau of the words

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.100 
it's a kind of portmanteau of the words
mannequin<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.620> equal<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.610> it's<00:05:12.790> about

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
mannequin and equal and it's about

wheelchair<00:05:17.980> for<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.220> mannequin<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:20.140> idea<00:05:20.500> is

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
wheelchair for a mannequin the idea is

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.950 
wheelchair for a mannequin the idea is
is<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.920> it<00:05:21.160> sits<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.030> winter<00:05:22.270> urn<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.810> in

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
is that it sits in a winter urn and in

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.740 
is that it sits in a winter urn and in
store<00:05:23.230> window<00:05:23.920> or<00:05:24.130> in<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.490> display<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.450> a

store window or in the display and a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.060 
store window or in the display and a
mannequin<00:05:26.080> sits<00:05:26.320> in<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:26.710> it's<00:05:26.860> sort<00:05:27.040> of

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
mannequin sits in it so it's sort of

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.160 
mannequin sits in it so it's sort of
bringing<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.640> this<00:05:28.330> whole<00:05:28.750> entire

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
bringing in this whole entire

perspective and my priorities but I do

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.990 
perspective and my priorities but I do
think<00:07:11.130> that<00:07:11.190> it<00:07:11.370> comes<00:07:11.610> with<00:07:11.910> the

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
think that it comes with the

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.450 
think that it comes with the
responsibility<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.990> the<00:07:13.770> responsibility

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
responsibility and the responsibility

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.220 
responsibility and the responsibility
that<00:07:14.550> I<00:07:14.610> find<00:07:14.880> is<00:07:15.000> that<00:07:15.090> I<00:07:15.120> have<00:07:15.360> to<00:07:15.480> react<00:07:15.810> to

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
that I find is that I have to react to

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.750 
that I find is that I have to react to
the<00:07:16.320> world<00:07:16.470> around<00:07:16.620> me<00:07:16.890> that<00:07:17.160> I've<00:07:17.250> now<00:07:17.460> come

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
the world around me that I've now come

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.610 
the world around me that I've now come
into<00:07:17.910> this<00:07:18.300> parallel<00:07:18.990> universe<00:07:19.020> of

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
into this parallel universe of

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.920 
into this parallel universe of
disability<00:07:20.310> and<00:07:20.550> to<00:07:20.580> try<00:07:21.270> and<00:07:21.300> change<00:07:21.600> things

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
disability and to try and change things

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.560 
disability and to try and change things
that<00:07:22.140> need<00:07:22.290> to<00:07:22.410> be<00:07:22.530> changed<00:07:23.010> and<00:07:23.360> sitting<00:07:24.360> here

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570 
that need to be changed and sitting here

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.570
