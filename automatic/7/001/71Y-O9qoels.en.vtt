00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.420
 well it him everyone knows what 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.680
 that she is today we find ourselves 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.449
 for a new gleacher video 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.350
 gÃ©taz s'encanaille French not so I 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.300
 I'll just show you 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.710
 how to make the boat under water like 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.390
 says power in the intro of the video 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.220
 so it's really a rich to his fans 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.420
 to realize so to achieve it you 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.829
 you will have to go to the same place 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.329
 than me in the video ie just 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.620
 at the end of this road that leads to zero 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.540
 so here you can see there is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.590
 an activity just wait there this is 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.839
 government site 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.700
 so I have not tested this activity 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.280
 this clash because I have no 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.660
 drinking connection to connect with 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.030
 four people already with one person 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.259
 it's already quite an ordeal so go 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.759
 test to see if you to achieve 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.590
 this book during the clash it can 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.479
 to be really good because we 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.740
 can be invincible and if you can 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.100
 put a parachute into a clash 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 it seems like no but try and you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.130
 can go boating under 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.890
 the aude it can be nice 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.020
 so as you could see we're going 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 just get to that place in the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.680
 government site and you had climbed 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.840
 above your car for so 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.549
 climbed on top of your door 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.350
 so once you are there you 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.840
 will see that left a year ago sidewalk 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.939
 so we can access it in the wall 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.399
 breach on both sides so here I go 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.590
 just go back and show you that he 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.549
 is a roof a void so once that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 you are there you can shoot at 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.659
 through the invisible wall to kill your 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.130
 opponents during the mission 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.079
 when I say during the mission but I 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.939
 do not know so maybe it can not 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.860
 not be possible on mission but in 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.509
 any case you will not be able to rage 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.100
 lot of people who walk beside 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.290
 who will want to kill you by going in 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 his branches of invincibility so a 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.200
 time you will be there too as I 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.570
 wanted to say you can go to either 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.940
 right be left on the sidewalks 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.680
 so both sides are the same you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.400
 can do so a ploy to 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.769
 go 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.420
 here behind grids so here we have them 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.489
 not see being behind but there is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 grids at the base here and once 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.069
 that you are there the enemies you 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.049
 will see and they will be able to 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.819
 to kill you so it can be good for 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.260
 the trolls and so once you 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.390
 will be there you can come out 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.939
 as I 'm doing by the ladder so everything 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.500
 you just stick to it so 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.609
 move to the second part of this group 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200
 to go boating underwater 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.390
 again it's a little bit more 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.590
 complicated you will do a half turn 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.000
 once you have climbed over the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.840
 door and place you on that roof 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.010
 invisible 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.989
 finally you will be there you are well 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.629
 activate your parachute in a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.489
 parachute inventory with before 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.900
 jump in the black hole otherwise it's okay 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.760
 do a little less time and you 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.040
 will be less likely to arrive 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.720
 so far so at the tip or sepia 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.609
 the water so here you go up and you 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.689
 directly cross once 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.269
 you will have done that you will put 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.519
 your sail up in the air because 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.439
 that it's really a little cabbage and 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.599
 as you arrive in the corner of the water 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.909
 ok this is again a glitch of 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.430
 details found by myself I am 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.319
 proud enough to have found this little snag 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 which is really very fun to achieve 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.099
 with your friends because there you can do 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.599
 from the boat under the beach it can be 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.079
 really not bad for making headlines 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.099
 age and so it's after like you 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.480
 could see it in the intro of the video 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.159
 it's still a little more fun because 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.069
 you can go boating underwater 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.329
 sweet was found by chance I was 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.730
 in the black hole and then I got 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.220
 folded over under water and that made me 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.040
 going in the water that made me go back to 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.409
 the surface so in fact it's invictus 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.609
 fun enough to realize so to have the 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.620
 boat you are simply called 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.419
 merriweather so I do not know if I 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.819
 say well we do not care so there you 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.269
 go call the boat he will come to you 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.010
 search 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.540
 and after you're going to do it because and no 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.060
 triangle for him stealing the boat and 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.109
 then after you go kill him with 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.159
 your weapon and then that's it 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.139
 you will take the boat for 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.690
 to have fun in this little oil 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.770
 breach so here I explain to you and after 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.090
 how 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.710
 to create a vacuum to make 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.480
 underwater boat is still enough 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:21.550
 simple and at the same time quite accurate to 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.740
 realize so first of all you go 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.110
 simply to see darken in the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.660
 black hole in direction here and you go 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.330
 you fall back to the side to go in 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.490
 actually picked up the oph the bottom of the ocean 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.440
 is there actually debate the boat is going 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.390
 continue as if they were in the water 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.890
 and you will be invincible at the same time 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.360
 that it does not last very long because 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.910
 the boat he will be directed to the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.290
 roof directly so if that's the place 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.270
 of glitch will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.440
 comment on them and why not 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.450
 to share it would make me really happy 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.940
 especially since we are soon 900 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.440
 subscribers on my channel so I hope that 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.090
 you will be at the rendezvous for 1900 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.290
 subscribers as for me I will see again 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.580
 once this video to the flu each 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.410
 and do as well as at the power knee chain 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.670
 hoping that these simu lawn and 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.290
 then I also invite you to watch the 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.360
