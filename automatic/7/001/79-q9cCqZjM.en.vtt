00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 vincenzo olivieri national president 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.240
 of the cetacean study center which is the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.870
 here a vast situation on the beach of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.370
 pen tip 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.309
 the situation we have one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.590
 mass stranding involved 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 seven individuals of the sperm whale species 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 it is similar to a similar episode 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 happened or december 2009 to capojale 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 of the Gargano are seven individuals also 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.060
 this time most likely yes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 is a group of sub individuals 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 adults that is right at this stage 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.800
 in life they gather in groups of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 five six seven specimens and captain 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.020
 also in the Adriatic waters what 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 has sparked this episode of 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.870
 we will establish mass stranding 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.700
 with necropsy most likely 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.330
 in these episodes of stranding 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.290
 surveys come into play 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.550
 oil or drills 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.590
 military that moon with noises noises that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.950
 produce the other vice versa with 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.780
 the use of sonar confuse these 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.360
 animals or force them to the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.880
 very fast reversions that lead to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.650
 a kind a sort of embolism and therefore 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.540
 to the death of these animals themselves 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.700
 some have already died 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.940
 it seems there are already dead laid on those 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 live you are trying a lot operation 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.180
 complex 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.920
 we try to bring them back to higher waters 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.360
 to prevent what is happening 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.100
 probably happened to individuals 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.930
 dead says there is a crush 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.530
 due precisely to the weight of these animals 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 who are used to living in water 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 therefore with a lower gravity in the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.630
 moment they are on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.880
 mainland is just that with the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.110
 their weight or damage to the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.509
 diaphragm and therefore consequently 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.700
 large lines die as is the weight of 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.560
 each copy a copy of these 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.380
 dimensions in then estimating it thus a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.759
 11 12-meter eye normally weighs 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.140
 12 13 tons 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.380
 so in short, a very considerable weight 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.450
 as we are seeing now looking for 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 to bring them back into the water we do not find a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.530
 medium that has the suitable power for 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.270
 move them mayor to mark an event 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.170
 particular and exceptional 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.590
 well it is a very ugly thing 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.290
 apart from the fact it had never happened but 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.250
 see the agony of these whales 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.740
 clear that it affects us all 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 unfortunately there is always a sign here 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.370
 most beautiful beach in the Adriatic today 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.410
 it represents the plot you city and 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.710
 what we as men are capable of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.650
 do i hope this is from 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.130
 warning to those who want to continue 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.660
 destroy this sea of â€‹â€‹ours 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.920
 national president of the cited center 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.110
 has formulated some hypotheses 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.630
 probably may have been 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.610
 some oil or research activities 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.920
 also military activities to have 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.470
 determined this agony as he said 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.050
 she of these of these sperm whales that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.270
 what do you feel to say about it 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.920
 I don't know it's clear register only 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.720
 this very dramatic fact that much 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.840
 everyone touches us closely 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.860
 after which the whole thing will be verified 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.770
 sure we have to take this too 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.930
 so heavy warning that it comes today for 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.239
 defend our Adriatic so that 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.920
 we will do with all our strength 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 mario mazzocca regional councilor 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.380
 to the environment today below 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.180
 exceptionally for this event 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.980
 especially the dramatic at the time 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.780
 same the stranding of seven 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.540
 sperm whales on the pen tip beach 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.190
 of a very serious fact I am 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.320
 precipitate here alerted by 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.390
 civil protection as well as how 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.970
 delegated also to the environment a fact 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.400
 so serious that really 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.480
 I think it should make everyone think a little 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.260
 how many of us on the use of ours 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.520
 natural environment 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.520
 in this case of our coasts 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 the causes of this event can be 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.340
 different, not infinitesimal, certain that the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.080
 presence of extraction facilities of 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.080
 hydrocarbons at a distance like this 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.390
 immediate and above all the will of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.030
 proceed in this direction 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.640
 I believe they are very serious facts to which 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.360
 we all the whole community 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.490
 Abruzzo must oppose because otherwise 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.730
 we risk a real drift 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.420
 I believe that it is not a case I believe that 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.670
 both really stands a high value 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.560
 the fact that these sperm whales are symbolic 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.720
 they probably came here to die 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.710
 they want us to understand something that they don't 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.710
 we still understand
