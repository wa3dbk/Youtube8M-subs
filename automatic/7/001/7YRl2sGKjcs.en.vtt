00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.300
 welcome guys with a brand new one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.770
 video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 today we're going to see how it could 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 be the new iphone 7 as always 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.500
 before starting, he invites them to leave 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 in short, many peoples , let's see if 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.049
 we reach the 10 thousand I like for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 this futuristic video well said 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.070
 this I would say to leave immediately then up 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.230
 internet are depopulating a mess of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 videos showing how it could be 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 the new iphone 7 or iphone 6 s and ci 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.620
 they are some kind of science fiction 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.350
 that we see absurd stuff and say that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.629
 I selected the most beautiful 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 today we're going to see a little if these 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 things are possible but above all 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.809
 when they managed to come up with why 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.180
 maybe apple could take inspiration and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.690
 do something for others too 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.239
 iphone 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.320
 having said that I would say to leave immediately with 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.180
 the first video 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.800
 let's say the most normal video does 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.219
 the ones I chose though a lot 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 normal is not because you see things 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.379
 quite futuristic though 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.479
 it looks really nice then after you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.729
 also show other videos that day 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.439
 they will probably make an impression on you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.900
 having said that let's start 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.560
 ok here is our beautiful hi 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 phone 7 and or iphone 6 is a century from mine 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 it is very cool especially shiny then it is 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 this guy had the idea to put 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 like the home button with lights and it's one 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 cool with colors, maybe not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 too beautiful apart from this obviously 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.009
 the golden cock that's always 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 beautiful there is always ok but it is not me 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.150
 one thing is clear because there is a screen 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.970
 of android on an iphone 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.670
 well this could have saved you 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.130
 good boy let's move on to the next video 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 and get ready because now there is something 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.610
 really awesome ie it would be 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.360
 a cool thing is 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.340
 ok i'd say leaving is kind of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.490
 integrated projector to the iphone that is one 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.439
 keyboard that is projected ok is not type 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.909
 the thing i know in the closet that 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.130
 we have shown this is several times 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.140
 just incorporated into the iphone 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.880
 I don't know how useful it could be here 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.400
 the thing to project the screen would be 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.130
 a pretty cool though if you put the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.890
 machine games how do you play 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.569
 there is the usual that moving games 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.269
 the iphone on the right to the left so pro 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.190
 how do you do if you have to project on a wall 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.650
 they would be a little complicated though 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.680
 fuck is cool i want to see her in 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.510
 next iphone even if I don't think so 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 just a thing of the possible 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.640
 genre since it is the next video you have 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.390
 shows something very cool ie su 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.480
 iphone is something incredible type 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.290
 too good of course it seems of with a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.760
 samsung galaxy s 4 is practically 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.910
 identical, however, is what puts it 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.030
 full screen as well on the edges is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.950
 a brilliant idea would be too much 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.299
 beautiful servants I swear I fell in love 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.880
 of its cost sooner or later I want it 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.980
 see the 20 megapixel camera 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.790
 ok well this seems a bit exaggerated 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.299
 it 's alright guys I'm so cool it is so cool 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.519
 nothing can be done is something 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.630
 brilliant probably in a few years 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.180
 in many years we will see him yes, perhaps 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.799
 when i'm old i'll pass 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.290
 to the last video which is something of its own 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.930
 on science fiction another bit 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.000
 what you see if you fund it first 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.500
 he would come out when I'm old 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.690
 this has it just when I will be a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 dead already handsome and buried for what 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.980
 you see there's look here what the fuck 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.260
 stuck right now 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.450
 so far everything normal ok not really 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.190
 because there is a flying lock these 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.190
 they are details then 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.739
 I don't know I have to comment on this 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.780
 it would be a beautiful thing you can 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.969
 have three screens on the table 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.000
 it seemed could have been a spaceship 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.980
 spatial and not just not finished here 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.400
 because you can also get out of the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.250
 screen upwards that say if there 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.430
 they will take many many years before they do 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.920
 see something like that 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.829
 indeed probably you will never even see it 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.169
 here then this am play that is vi 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.349
 imagine that cool to play a game 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.479
 that would be too good a pity 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.690
 but that all these things probably 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.199
 we will never see them in the iphone self and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.970
 maybe in the iphone 35 or you have with 50 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.310
 you will be able to start seeing things 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.830
 of the genre but they seem to me a little too much 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.990
 futuristic these things even if I have to 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660
 say it would be so cool you imagine a 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.960
 projector all these functions not 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.060
 I know it would be something absolutely 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.070
 ethical ok guys I would say this video 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.199
 can add to term i hope you 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.750
 both liked it because I liked it 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.270
 this journey of fantasy between the iphone 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.580
 set the iPhone 6s that probably won't 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.289
 it will never be like this, but let's not cross our fingers 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.830
 you never know 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.330
 I really think it's not anyway 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.960
 success is really a ideas 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.400
 cool 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.900
 having said that I invite you to leave many 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 nice poles are up we see if 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.539
 we reach 10 thousand likes for the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.740
