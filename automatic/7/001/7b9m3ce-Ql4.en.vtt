00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
to get done there also a lot of power

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.619 
to get done there also a lot of power
blackouts<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.879> have<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.269> make<00:03:39.449> sure<00:03:39.479> that

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
blackouts so you have to make sure that

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.569 
blackouts so you have to make sure that
you<00:03:39.870> have<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> good<00:03:40.500> source<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.919> energy<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
you have a good source of energy to

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.559 
you have a good source of energy to
power<00:03:42.389> up<00:03:42.659> your<00:03:42.900> your<00:03:43.440> lights<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.069> your<00:03:44.639> your

power up your your lights and your your
camera<00:03:45.930> batteries<00:03:46.519> that's<00:03:47.519> another

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
camera batteries that's another

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.509 
camera batteries that's another
challenge<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:49.319> think<00:03:49.349> maybe<00:03:49.709> one<00:03:50.159> last

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
challenge and I think maybe one last

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.789 
challenge and I think maybe one last
challenge<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.720> happens<00:03:52.319> at<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
challenge that happens at this

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.439 
challenge that happens at this
particular<00:03:53.310> time<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.519> year<00:03:53.729> which<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.000> Ramadan
