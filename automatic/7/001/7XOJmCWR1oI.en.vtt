00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.350 
said here is the bread that we made in
the<00:05:04.389> crock-pot<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:05.680> took<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.280> started<00:05:06.669> at<00:05:06.820> 1:30

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
the crock-pot it took I started at 1:30

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.659 
the crock-pot it took I started at 1:30
and<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:08.140> got<00:05:08.320> done<00:05:08.530> at<00:05:08.710> 3<00:05:08.979> o'clock<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.550> that

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
and it got done at 3 o'clock so that

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.120 
and it got done at 3 o'clock so that
means<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.180> took<00:05:10.390> an<00:05:10.510> hour<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.900> half<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.560> bake

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
means it took an hour and a half to bake

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.790 
means it took an hour and a half to bake
in<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.910> slow<00:05:13.120> cooker<00:05:13.150> /<00:05:13.870> crock-pot<00:05:14.229> whatever

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
in the slow cooker / crock-pot whatever

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.040 
in the slow cooker / crock-pot whatever
you<00:05:14.890> want<00:05:15.039> to<00:05:15.100> call<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.690> then<00:05:16.690> like<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.020> said

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
you want to call it and then like I said

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.560 
you want to call it and then like I said

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
this is the one that I did in the oven

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.860 
this is the one that I did in the oven
like<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.020> normally<00:05:20.080> would<00:05:20.500> cook<00:05:21.419> so<00:05:22.419> as<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.720> can

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
like I normally would cook so as you can

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.570 
like I normally would cook so as you can
see<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.440> can<00:05:23.590> tell<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.950> two<00:05:24.130> are<00:05:24.310> pretty

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
see you can tell the two are pretty

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.390 
see you can tell the two are pretty
different<00:05:25.620> then<00:05:26.620> I'm<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:26.950> go<00:05:27.070> ahead<00:05:27.160> and

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
different then I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.890 
different then I'm going to go ahead and
slice<00:05:27.669> into<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.180> one<00:05:28.479> because<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.810> already

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
slice into this one because I already

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.529 
slice into this one because I already
know<00:05:29.110> what<00:05:29.320> my<00:05:29.350> bread<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.979> like<00:05:30.389> so<00:05:31.389> we're

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
know what my bread is like so we're

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.000 
know what my bread is like so we're
going<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.690> go<00:05:31.840> ahead<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.260> slice<00:05:32.530> under<00:05:32.830> this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
going to go ahead and slice under this

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.730 
going to go ahead and slice under this
one<00:05:33.220> here

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.090 

and<00:05:37.740> we're<00:05:37.890> going<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.040> get<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> view<00:05:38.870> of<00:05:39.870> how<00:05:40.260> it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
and we're going to get a view of how it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.320 
and we're going to get a view of how it
turned<00:05:41.400> out

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.150 

and<00:05:45.330> I<00:05:45.510> have<00:05:45.780> Donnie<00:05:46.140> over<00:05:46.380> here<00:05:46.680> on<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.890> side

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
and I have Donnie over here on the side

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.490 
and I have Donnie over here on the side
and<00:05:47.820> I'm<00:05:48.180> going<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.390> give<00:05:48.570> him<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.810> piece<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.350> it

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
and I'm going to give him a piece of it

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.820 
and I'm going to give him a piece of it
and<00:05:49.710> I'm<00:05:50.430> going<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.610> have<00:05:50.820> him<00:05:51.150> try<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.680> now<00:05:52.680> of

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
and I'm going to have him try it now of

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.950 
and I'm going to have him try it now of
course<00:05:53.040> it's<00:05:53.340> still<00:05:53.550> warm<00:05:53.820> so<00:05:54.120> kind<00:05:54.420> of<00:05:54.480> you

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
course it's still warm so kind of you

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.010 
course it's still warm so kind of you
know<00:05:55.080> fell<00:05:55.410> apart<00:05:55.740> but<00:05:56.330> it's<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.540> matter<00:05:57.750> of

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
know fell apart but it's the matter of

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.150 
know fell apart but it's the matter of
the<00:05:58.200> taste<00:05:58.560> that's<00:05:58.950> important<00:06:01.040> and<00:06:02.040> I<00:06:02.130> think

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
the taste that's important and I think

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.280 
the taste that's important and I think
I'll<00:06:02.640> try<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.970> piece<00:06:03.330> as<00:06:03.570> well

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.030 

it's<00:06:09.160> actually<00:06:09.490> pretty<00:06:09.670> good

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.500 

it's<00:06:14.670> done<00:06:15.530> all<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.590> way<00:06:16.890> through<00:06:17.510> it's

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
it's done all the way through it's

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
it's done all the way through it's
actually<00:06:18.930> pretty<00:06:19.170> soft<00:06:20.540> the<00:06:21.540> outside<00:06:22.170> edge

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
actually pretty soft the outside edge

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.690 
actually pretty soft the outside edge
here<00:06:23.160> is<00:06:23.340> actually<00:06:24.240> kind<00:06:24.510> of<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:25.460> kind<00:06:26.460> of

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
here is actually kind of the kind of

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.040 
here is actually kind of the kind of
hard<00:06:28.580> but<00:06:29.580> not<00:06:29.790> too<00:06:30.030> bad

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
hard but not too bad

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.490 
hard but not too bad
yes<00:06:31.590> I<00:06:31.920> didn't<00:06:32.640> better<00:06:32.850> it<00:06:33.060> before<00:06:33.510> I<00:06:33.540> cut<00:06:34.170> open

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
yes I didn't better it before I cut open

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.900 
yes I didn't better it before I cut open
like<00:06:34.710> I<00:06:35.520> did<00:06:35.730> this<00:06:35.940> lip<00:06:36.180> here<00:06:36.320> but<00:06:37.320> all<00:06:37.470> in<00:06:37.620> all

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
like I did this lip here but all in all

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.270 
like I did this lip here but all in all
it<00:06:38.910> tastes<00:06:39.240> pretty<00:06:39.420> good

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280
