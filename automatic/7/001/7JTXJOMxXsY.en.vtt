think they should just go ahead and call
me<00:00:52.440> regístrate<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.579> straight

so imagine all the sweating stuff that's
probably<00:05:08.130> built<00:05:08.340> up<00:05:08.490> from<00:05:08.610> there<00:05:08.789> but<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.210> does

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
probably built up from there but it does

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.290 
probably built up from there but it does
not<00:05:09.479> share<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.750> does<00:05:10.020> not<00:05:10.139> tangle<00:05:10.820> anyway<00:05:11.820> you

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
not share it does not tangle anyway you
