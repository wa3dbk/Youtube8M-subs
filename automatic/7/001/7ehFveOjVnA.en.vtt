by the way so we're going to play the D
string<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.869> sixth

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
string on the sixth

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.030 
string on the sixth
the<00:01:56.070> next<00:01:56.369> interval<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:58.520> nine<00:01:59.659> seven<00:02:00.659> nine

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
the next interval is a nine seven nine

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.140 
the next interval is a nine seven nine
being<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.820> low<00:02:03.000> string<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> string

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
being that the low string are a string

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.109 
being that the low string are a string
next<00:02:06.150> interval<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.960> an<00:02:07.229> eleven<00:02:07.770> nine

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.339 

the<00:02:10.660> next<00:02:10.959> interval<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.879> where<00:02:13.599> now<00:02:13.810> we're

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
the next interval is where now we're

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.869 
the next interval is where now we're
moving<00:02:14.530> up<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.860> set<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.040> strings<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.580> now<00:02:15.730> we're

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
moving up a set of strings so now we're

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.720 
moving up a set of strings so now we're
going<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> third<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.690> fourth<00:02:16.930> string<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
going to the third and fourth string so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.300 
going to the third and fourth string so
fourth<00:02:19.269> string<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.750> well<00:02:20.140> they're<00:02:20.290> both<00:02:20.410> nines

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
fourth string is well they're both nines

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.110 
fourth string is well they're both nines
the<00:02:22.730> next<00:02:23.030> interval<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.890> leave<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.120> finger

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
the next interval I leave that finger

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.940 
the next interval I leave that finger
right<00:02:26.240> there<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.600> just<00:02:26.630> add<00:02:26.990> my<00:02:27.260> ring

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
right there and I just add my ring

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.380 
right there and I just add my ring
finger<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.940> 11th<00:02:29.330> fret<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.560> d-string

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
finger to the 11th fret of the d-string

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.530 
finger to the 11th fret of the d-string
so<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.870> got<00:02:33.140> an<00:02:33.410> 11<00:02:34.280> 9

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
so I have got an 11 9

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.960 
so I have got an 11 9
and<00:02:37.170> then<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.799> jump<00:02:38.040> another<00:02:38.310> set<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.700> strings

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and then we jump another set of strings

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
and then we jump another set of strings
so<00:02:39.209> we're<00:02:39.330> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> go<00:02:39.959> through<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> second

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so we're going to go through the second

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.460 
so we're going to go through the second
and<00:02:41.159> third<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:42.629> ninth<00:02:42.900> fret<00:02:43.019> again<00:02:44.269> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
and third on the ninth fret again and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.319 
and third on the ninth fret again and
then<00:02:46.470> here's<00:02:47.459> where<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.670> jumps<00:02:47.939> out<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
then here's where it jumps out of this

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.559 
then here's where it jumps out of this
scale<00:02:49.549> then<00:02:50.549> I'm<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.790> lay<00:02:50.879> my<00:02:50.909> index

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
scale then I'm going to lay my index

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.300 
scale then I'm going to lay my index
around<00:02:52.049> I'm<00:02:52.200> sorry<00:02:52.409> my<00:02:52.530> middle<00:02:52.799> finger<00:02:53.069> on<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
around I'm sorry my middle finger on the

to know about that one

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.330 
to know about that one
the<00:04:28.900> important<00:04:29.229> thing<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.650> muting<00:04:30.009> to<00:04:30.190> get

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
the important thing is the muting to get

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.990 
the important thing is the muting to get
