00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey hey let's do it respess recess event

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.220 
hey hey let's do it respess recess event
this<00:00:03.689> days<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.170> problem<00:00:04.740> yeah<00:00:05.509> so<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:06.960> far<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
this days is problem yeah so so far the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.560 
this days is problem yeah so so far the
problem<00:00:07.529> told<00:00:07.740> us<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.099> Big<00:00:08.490> C<00:00:08.760> gives<00:00:09.360> us

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
problem told us that Big C gives us

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
problem told us that Big C gives us
color<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.530> would<00:00:10.769> mean<00:00:10.889> little<00:00:11.190> C<00:00:11.370> little

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
color so that would mean little C little

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
color so that would mean little C little
C<00:00:11.880> there<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.719> Big<00:00:12.929> C<00:00:13.139> Dash<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.679> gonna<00:00:13.860> be

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
C there so the Big C Dash is gonna be

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
C there so the Big C Dash is gonna be
color<00:00:14.160> right<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> means<00:00:14.639> any<00:00:14.940> combination

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
color right that means any combination

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
color right that means any combination
of<00:00:15.839> Big<00:00:16.020> C<00:00:16.199> alright<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.460> then<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.880> C<00:00:18.000> little

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
of Big C alright so then little C little

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.939 
of Big C alright so then little C little
C<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> no<00:00:18.690> color<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:20.720> big<00:00:21.720> egg<00:00:21.930> -<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.529> told<00:00:22.800> us

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
C is no color so big egg - it told us

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.380 
C is no color so big egg - it told us
was<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> beauty<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> little<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.410> black

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
was a beauty and little a little black

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
was a beauty and little a little black
but<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.189> rely<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
but we know that these two rely on the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
but we know that these two rely on the
presence<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> Big<00:00:33.750> C<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.219> else

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
presence of a Big C to get that or else

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.130 
presence of a Big C to get that or else
we're<00:00:35.489> gonna<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.850> no<00:00:36.090> color<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:37.110> can

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
we're gonna have no color so we can

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.450 
we're gonna have no color so we can
rewrite<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.370> dash<00:00:38.670> C<00:00:39.540> Dash<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:41.160> agouti

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
rewrite this as a dash C Dash is agouti

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
rewrite this as a dash C Dash is agouti
little<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.940> AC<00:00:45.480> -<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.879> black<00:00:49.219> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
little a little AC - if it is black and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.209 
little a little AC - if it is black and
so<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.600> -<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.039> see

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so we can go a - a little see little see

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
so we can go a - a little see little see
no<00:00:54.000> matter<00:00:54.120> any<00:00:54.449> combination<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
no matter any combination of a if we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
no matter any combination of a if we
have<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.190> C<00:00:56.340> that's<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:56.670> color

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
have little see little C that's no color

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.290 
have little see little C that's no color
so<00:00:58.609> those<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> three<00:01:00.270> things

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so those are gonna be the three things

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
so those are gonna be the three things
that<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.930> looking<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.260> after<00:01:01.710> we

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that we're gonna be looking for after we

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.260 
that we're gonna be looking for after we
do<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:01.980> dihybrid<00:01:02.370> cross<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> says<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.850> f1

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
do our dihybrid cross it says so what f1

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
do our dihybrid cross it says so what f1
and<00:01:06.450> f2<00:01:06.630> genotype<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.590> phenotype<00:01:07.860> ratios<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and f2 genotype and phenotype ratios are

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.100 
and f2 genotype and phenotype ratios are
obtained<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.060> across<00:01:09.360> between<00:01:09.630> big<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> big<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
obtained from across between big a big a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.210 
obtained from across between big a big a
big<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.380> big<00:01:13.619> seen<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:18.500> little<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
big see big seen a little a little a

little see little see
okay<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.070> f1<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> f2<00:01:23.909> anytime<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.659> true

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
okay so f1 and f2 anytime we see true

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.020 
okay so f1 and f2 anytime we see true
breeders<00:01:26.180> crossing<00:01:27.180> we're<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.810> away

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
breeders crossing we're gonna get away

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
breeders crossing we're gonna get away
yeah<00:01:30.060> sorry<00:01:30.659> our<00:01:30.840> die<00:01:31.020> -<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.890> get

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
yeah sorry our die - we're gonna get

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.090 
yeah sorry our die - we're gonna get
heterozygous<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.060> said<00:01:33.299> yes<00:01:33.540> okay<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.100> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
heterozygous you said yes okay so this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.569 
heterozygous you said yes okay so this
is<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.340> f1<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.530> tells<00:01:37.710> cigar<00:01:38.009> f2<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
is our f1 and then it tells cigar f2 so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.050 
is our f1 and then it tells cigar f2 so
we're<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.790> solve<00:01:39.090> across<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:41.060> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we're gonna solve across that and this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.580 
we're gonna solve across that and this
is<00:01:42.180> whenever<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.840> our<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.140> classic

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is whenever we do our like classic

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.270 
is whenever we do our like classic
dihybrid<00:01:43.979> cross<00:01:44.310> track<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:47.040> gonna<00:01:47.130> get

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
dihybrid cross track so we're gonna get

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
dihybrid cross track so we're gonna get
16<00:01:47.729> cells<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> we're<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> our

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
16 cells so we're gonna do all of our

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:08.520 
16 cells so we're gonna do all of our
possible<00:01:52.350> gametes<00:01:52.590> here

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530
