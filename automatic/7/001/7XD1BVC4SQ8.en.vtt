00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
scalp and right at the roots so I tend

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
know let the nutrients really you know

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
know let the nutrients really you know
sink<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.270> scalp<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> works<00:01:11.280> very<00:01:11.549> where
