the<00:03:38.280> same<00:03:38.519> time<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.510> he's<00:03:39.630> going<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> be

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the same time and then he's going to be

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.539 
the same time and then he's going to be
entering<00:03:40.140> from<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.470> top<00:03:40.769> left-hand<00:03:41.310> side

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.430 
entering from this top left-hand side
using<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.000> hogs<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.510> spreading<00:03:43.230> them<00:03:43.350> out

using the hogs and spreading them out

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.199 
using the hogs and spreading them out
all<00:03:43.680> around<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.730> way<00:03:44.940> they<00:03:45.060> can

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
all around so that way they can

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.509 
all around so that way they can
concentrate<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.140> area<00:03:46.440> right<00:03:47.160> after<00:03:47.400> they

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
concentrate in one area right after they

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.740 
concentrate in one area right after they
jump<00:03:47.760> through<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> walls<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.450> destroyed

their way in the second layer of the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.930 
their way in the second layer of the
base<00:03:54.650> fortunately<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.860> him<00:03:56.040> Madden<00:03:56.519> had<00:03:56.640> one

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
base fortunately for him Madden had one

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.240 
base fortunately for him Madden had one
inferno<00:03:57.510> set<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> single<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.890> other<00:03:59.040> one

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
inferno set to single and the other one

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.940 
inferno set to single and the other one
on<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.489> far<00:03:59.760> side<00:04:00.060> set<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> multi<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.200> Madden

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
on the far side set to multi if Madden

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.490 
on the far side set to multi if Madden
had<00:04:02.130> both<00:04:02.400> Inferno<00:04:02.820> sets<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.329> multi<00:04:03.780> then<00:04:04.320> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
had both Inferno sets you multi then it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
had both Inferno sets you multi then it
would<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.709> been<00:04:04.799> pretty<00:04:05.070> bad<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.640> houses

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
would have been pretty bad in houses

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
would have been pretty bad in houses
situation<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.500> what's<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.860> time<00:04:08.130> in<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
situation so what's that time in the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.370 
situation so what's that time in the
raid<00:04:08.610> where<00:04:08.880> he<00:04:09.269> used<00:04:09.480> all<00:04:09.630> his<00:04:09.690> spells<00:04:10.110> and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
raid where he used all his spells and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.170 
raid where he used all his spells and
also<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> majority<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.340> his<00:04:11.640> hogs<00:04:11.910> are<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.120> to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
also a majority of his hogs are going to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.900 
also a majority of his hogs are going to
die<00:04:12.329> off<00:04:12.480> right<00:04:12.750> about<00:04:12.900> now<00:04:13.019> but<00:04:13.549> overall<00:04:14.549> he

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
die off right about now but overall he

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.670 
die off right about now but overall he
did<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> nice<00:04:15.329> job<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.630> taking<00:04:15.900> out<00:04:16.140> half<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
did a nice job of taking out half of the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.590 
did a nice job of taking out half of the
base<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> other<00:04:17.970> half<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:18.450> still

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
base you can see the other half is still

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.330 
base you can see the other half is still
on<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:18.930> side<00:04:19.229> so<00:04:19.799> he<00:04:19.890> deploys<00:04:20.190> his

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
on the right side so he deploys his

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.909 
on the right side so he deploys his
cleanup<00:04:20.609> shoobs<00:04:20.970> on<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.390> left<00:04:21.660> hand<00:04:21.870> side<00:04:22.020> his

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
cleanup shoobs on the left hand side his

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.589 
cleanup shoobs on the left hand side his
wizards<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.490> also<00:04:23.820> his<00:04:24.000> archers<00:04:24.360> going<00:04:24.539> to

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
wizards and also his archers going to

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.600 
wizards and also his archers going to
work<00:04:24.750> their<00:04:24.900> way<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.410> second<00:04:25.830> layer<00:04:25.979> not

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
work their way in that second layer not

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.900 
work their way in that second layer not
going<00:04:26.760> to

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
going to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.670 
going to
so<00:04:26.970> far<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.540> he's<00:04:27.630> mainly<00:04:27.870> gonna<00:04:28.080> rely<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.560> his

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so far so he's mainly gonna rely on his

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.710 
so far so he's mainly gonna rely on his
arch<00:04:28.890> between<00:04:29.160> level<00:04:29.460> 10<00:04:29.730> who<00:04:30.240> was<00:04:30.390> working<00:04:30.570> on

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
arch between level 10 who was working on

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.840 
arch between level 10 who was working on
the<00:04:30.870> outside<00:04:31.320> buildings<00:04:31.770> luckily<00:04:32.550> there<00:04:32.760> was

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
the outside buildings luckily there was

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.520 
the outside buildings luckily there was
no<00:04:33.030> more<00:04:33.180> defensive<00:04:33.720> buildings<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.140> range<00:04:34.410> of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
no more defensive buildings in range of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.920 
no more defensive buildings in range of
her<00:04:34.680> until<00:04:35.130> now<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.670> by<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.150> time<00:04:36.360> she's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
her until now and by that time she's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.720 
her until now and by that time she's
already<00:04:37.110> getting<00:04:37.230> closer<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.800> fifty<00:04:38.340> percent

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
already getting closer to fifty percent

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.060 
already getting closer to fifty percent
so<00:04:39.510> forty-eight<00:04:40.110> percent<00:04:40.260> arch<00:04:40.770> Queen's

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
so forty-eight percent arch Queen's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.650 
so forty-eight percent arch Queen's
