but<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.290> controllers<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.160> need<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.370> make

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
but the controllers you need to make

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.920 
but the controllers you need to make
sure<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.910> charge<00:02:54.209> controllers<00:02:54.780> if

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
sure you have charge controllers if

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.420 
sure you have charge controllers if
they're<00:02:55.080> Wireless<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.770> whole<00:02:56.160> lot<00:02:56.340> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
they're Wireless a whole lot of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.800 
they're Wireless a whole lot of
controllers<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.910> gotta<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.209> working<00:02:57.630> and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
controllers you gotta have working and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.600 
controllers you gotta have working and
backups<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.770> few<00:02:58.950> backups<00:02:59.250> down<00:02:59.400> there

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
backups I have a few backups down there

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.800 
backups I have a few backups down there
just<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.360> case

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
just in case

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.120 
just in case
so<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> NES<00:03:01.290> controller<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.830> Super<00:03:02.040> Nintendo

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
so the NES controller is Super Nintendo

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.790 
so the NES controller is Super Nintendo
and<00:03:02.640> 64<00:03:03.270> for<00:03:03.989> GameCube<00:03:04.380> I'm<00:03:04.470> probably<00:03:04.620> gonna

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
and 64 for GameCube I'm probably gonna

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.410 
and 64 for GameCube I'm probably gonna
use<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:05.010> wave<00:03:05.250> bird<00:03:05.550> because<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:05.970> Wireless

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
use a wave bird because it's Wireless

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.699 
use a wave bird because it's Wireless
but<00:03:06.630> we'll<00:03:06.750> see<00:03:06.900> how<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.140> goes<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.590> use<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
but we'll see how that goes I can use a

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
but we'll see how that goes I can use a
wired<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.280> need<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.820> lot<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.510> Wii

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
wired one if I need to a lot of Wii

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.930 
wired one if I need to a lot of Wii
remotes<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.410> few<00:03:10.590> nunchucks<00:03:11.040> are<00:03:11.400> here

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
remotes and a few nunchucks are here

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.910 
remotes and a few nunchucks are here
around<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:12.930> use<00:03:13.050> them<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.440> then

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
around so that we can use them and then

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.080 
around so that we can use them and then
for<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.130> Wii<00:03:14.250> U<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> few<00:03:14.880> pro

there's a bunch of consoles down there

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.560 
there's a bunch of consoles down there
but<00:03:29.250> almost<00:03:29.489> all<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.850> consoles<00:03:30.239> are<00:03:30.330> where

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
but almost all the consoles are where

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.090 
but almost all the consoles are where
they<00:03:30.720> traditionally<00:03:31.019> are<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> didn't<00:03:31.950> really

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
they traditionally are I didn't really

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.740 
they traditionally are I didn't really
have<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.370> move<00:03:32.489> any<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.850> them<00:03:32.970> around<00:03:33.090> they're

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
have to move any of them around they're

have to move any of them around they're
always<00:03:34.530> set<00:03:34.769> up<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.190> had<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> unplug<00:03:35.670> a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
always set up so I just had to unplug a

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
always set up so I just had to unplug a
few<00:03:36.000> cords<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.450> plug<00:03:36.930> them<00:03:37.080> into<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.350> new<00:03:37.590> two

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.680 
gotta set it up for streaming that's
gonna<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:44.640> probably<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:45.030> little<00:03:45.269> bit<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.510> just

gonna take probably a little bit to just

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.600 
gonna take probably a little bit to just
get<00:03:45.870> hooked<00:03:46.380> up<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.650> connected<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.430> can

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
get hooked up and connected but I can

trying to get every game have a little
bit<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.640> its<00:03:59.760> moment<00:04:00.150> while<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:00.930> actually<00:04:01.410> on

bit of its moment while it's actually on

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.110 
bit of its moment while it's actually on
Twitch<00:04:02.130> because<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.489> would<00:04:02.610> be<00:04:02.700> pretty<00:04:02.880> cool

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
Twitch because I would be pretty cool

Twitch because I would be pretty cool
other<00:04:03.840> things<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.470> should<00:04:04.650> mention<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.190> do

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
other things that I should mention I do

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280 
other things that I should mention I do
have<00:04:05.910> obviously<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.600> got<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.870> prepare<00:04:07.170> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
have obviously you got to prepare and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.509 
have obviously you got to prepare and
get<00:04:07.380> some<00:04:07.590> snacks<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.070> there's<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.310> lot<00:04:08.430> of

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
get some snacks so there's a lot of

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.780 
get some snacks so there's a lot of
snacks<00:04:08.850> here<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.870> also<00:04:10.200> wrote<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.340> what<00:04:11.670> we

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
snacks here we also wrote out what we

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.190 
snacks here we also wrote out what we
thought<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.390> would<00:04:12.450> probably<00:04:12.690> take<00:04:12.870> us
