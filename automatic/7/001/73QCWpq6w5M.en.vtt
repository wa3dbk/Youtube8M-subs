that<00:00:18.119> i<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.140> series<00:00:19.619> kick

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that i can just to get this series kick

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
that i can just to get this series kick
start<00:00:20.130> now<00:00:20.430> kick<00:00:20.609> start<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.000> already<00:00:21.240> started

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
start now kick start is already started

start now kick start is already started
I<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.199> often<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> nice<00:00:23.010> boost<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:23.609> drop

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I just often get a nice boost to my drop

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.009 
I just often get a nice boost to my drop
strap<00:00:24.029> hopefully<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.539> closer<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
strap hopefully get closer to that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
strap hopefully get closer to that
virtus<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:26.369> me<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.670> bank<00:00:27.000> because

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
virtus and make me some bank because

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
virtus and make me some bank because

after 54 kills i should be expecting
almost<00:00:51.719> 2<00:00:51.899> drops<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> first

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
almost 2 drops now but that's the first

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
got like three two thoughts already to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
got like three two thoughts already to
loop<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.079> sand-like<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.829> dragon<00:00:59.250> beggars

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
loop a sand-like for dragon beggars

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.420 
loop a sand-like for dragon beggars
which<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.120> trouble<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.190> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

that<00:01:04.830> nice<00:01:05.100> arches<00:01:05.519> ring<00:01:06.049> haha<00:01:07.049> there's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that nice arches ring haha there's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
that nice arches ring haha there's
another<00:01:07.590> rare<00:01:07.890> drop<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.520> some<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.909> actually

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
another rare drop but some are actually

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.289 
another rare drop but some are actually
recording<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.400> room<00:01:11.670> battle-axe

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
recording it and it's a room battle-axe

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.170 
recording it and it's a room battle-axe
which<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> supreme

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
which is kind of from the supreme

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.550 
which is kind of from the supreme
but<00:01:16.049> um<00:01:17.009> I've<00:01:17.640> done<00:01:17.909> 80<00:01:18.390> kills<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
but um I've done 80 kills right now so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.179 
but um I've done 80 kills right now so
got<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.369> bow<00:01:21.360> I'd<00:01:21.840> save<00:01:22.229> 50<00:01:22.799> minutes<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> all

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
got the bow I'd save 50 minutes of all

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
got the bow I'd save 50 minutes of all
those<00:01:23.430> left<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.180> quick<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.570> after

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
those left that was some quick one after

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
those left that was some quick one after
fifty<00:01:25.020> five<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> 15<00:01:25.590> minutes<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
fifty five to 15 minutes of all the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
fifty five to 15 minutes of all the
loads<00:01:26.189> left<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.520> let's<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> hope<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
loads left so let's just hope can get a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
loads left so let's just hope can get a
couple<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.320> drops<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:29.189> hoping<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.180> at

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
couple more drops I'm hoping for a by at

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.230 
couple more drops I'm hoping for a by at
least<00:01:30.420> 120<00:01:31.079> 230<00:01:31.619> kills<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> trip<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
least 120 230 kills this trip and I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
least 120 230 kills this trip and I
should<00:01:33.450> beat<00:01:33.689> about<00:01:33.810> four<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.110> five<00:01:34.259> drops<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
should beat about four or five drops but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
should beat about four or five drops but
I<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.460> trolled<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
I have been going to be trolled all of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
I have been going to be trolled all of
Western<00:01:36.840> art<00:01:36.960> history<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
Western art history and there's this

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
Western art history and there's this
sweetly<00:01:38.670> we've<00:01:38.880> been<00:01:39.030> looking<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.840> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

about two hours of QED so that's very
very<00:03:12.150> nice<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.930> posed<00:03:13.140> drained<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> drops
