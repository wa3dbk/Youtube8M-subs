3<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.209> probably<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.019> weakest<00:03:13.470> definitely<00:03:14.189> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
3 is probably the weakest definitely a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.099 
3 is probably the weakest definitely a
my<00:03:14.730> opinion<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> weakest<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.840> first

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
my opinion the weakest in the first

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.470 
my opinion the weakest in the first
three<00:03:16.379> films<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.310> really<00:03:17.819> even<00:03:17.909> rate<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
three films I don't really even rate the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.149 
three films I don't really even rate the
last<00:03:18.689> I<00:03:19.170> don't<00:03:19.319> know<00:03:19.470> how<00:03:19.530> many<00:03:19.650> films<00:03:19.950> they

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
last I don't know how many films they

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.420 
last I don't know how many films they
may<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:20.489> made<00:03:20.670> another<00:03:20.879> 5<00:03:21.239> at<00:03:21.629> least

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
may know they made another 5 at least

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.770 
may know they made another 5 at least
and<00:03:23.430> last<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.849> was<00:03:23.939> Revelations<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.659> might

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and last one was Revelations that might

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.069 
and last one was Revelations that might
even<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.989> number<00:03:25.260> 9<00:03:25.819> but<00:03:26.819> yeah<00:03:26.909> how<00:03:27.030> Rosa<00:03:27.239> 3<00:03:27.599> is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
even be number 9 but yeah how Rosa 3 is

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.929 
even be number 9 but yeah how Rosa 3 is
you<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.129> as<00:03:29.280> an<00:03:29.400> effects<00:03:29.730> film

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
you know I think it as an effects film

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.670 
you know I think it as an effects film
that's<00:03:30.120> quite<00:03:30.389> good<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.810> it's<00:03:31.019> alright<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.650> a

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
quite easy to open like that but yeah

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.629 
quite easy to open like that but yeah
it's<00:07:06.169> a<00:07:06.229> really<00:07:06.259> nice<00:07:06.650> set<00:07:07.099> and<00:07:07.310> I<00:07:07.370> believe

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
it's a really nice set and I believe

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.179 
it's a really nice set and I believe
it's<00:07:07.789> gonna<00:07:07.879> be<00:07:08.030> retailing<00:07:08.419> at<00:07:08.599> Joby<00:07:08.900> stores

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.800 
it's gonna be retailing at Joby stores
$450<00:07:10.189> so<00:07:10.400> I<00:07:10.729> think<00:07:10.969> it's<00:07:11.060> a<00:07:11.120> pretty<00:07:11.389> good<00:07:11.599> value

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
$450 so I think it's a pretty good value

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.320 
$450 so I think it's a pretty good value
