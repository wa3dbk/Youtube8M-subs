you<00:05:58.030> still<00:05:58.360> have<00:05:58.389> TDK<00:05:59.319> that's<00:06:00.039> contributing

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
you still have TDK that's contributing

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.709

so<00:06:01.389> I<00:06:01.449> think<00:06:01.509> that<00:06:02.110> his<00:06:02.770> legacy<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.969> his<00:06:04.030> child

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719

as<00:06:05.169> well<00:06:05.409> as<00:06:05.590> his<00:06:05.800> crew<00:06:06.129> as<00:06:06.370> well<00:06:06.669> as<00:06:07.150> his<00:06:07.360> works
