for<00:00:08.109> this<00:00:08.230> weed<00:00:08.470> tutorial<00:00:09.250> I<00:00:09.460> have<00:00:09.730> created<00:00:10.000> a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
for this weed tutorial I have created a

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.810 
for this weed tutorial I have created a
two<00:00:10.660> clips<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.559> first<00:00:11.860> has<00:00:12.219> the<00:00:12.250> numbers<00:00:12.700> at

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
two clips the first has the numbers at

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.330 
two clips the first has the numbers at
one<00:00:13.000> to<00:00:13.180> 26<00:00:13.809> and<00:00:14.020> the<00:00:14.230> second<00:00:14.650> clip<00:00:14.830> has<00:00:15.190> the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
one to 26 and the second clip has the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.630 
one to 26 and the second clip has the
alphabet<00:00:15.940> from<00:00:16.510> a<00:00:16.630> all<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.230> way<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.380> Z<00:00:17.800> put

alphabet from a all the way to Z put
together<00:00:18.790> onto<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.480> timeline<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.410> two<00:00:20.619> clips

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
together onto the timeline the two clips

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.859 
together onto the timeline the two clips
make<00:00:21.220> what<00:00:21.460> we'd<00:00:21.610> call<00:00:21.820> two<00:00:22.240> individual

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
make what we'd call two individual

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.380 
make what we'd call two individual

left and then drag to the left you can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
left and then drag to the left you can
see<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> numbers<00:00:58.380> are<00:00:58.560> going<00:00:58.830> down<00:00:58.950> what's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
see the numbers are going down what's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
see the numbers are going down what's
occurring<00:01:00.450> is<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.990> numbers<00:01:01.320> 21<00:01:01.740> to<00:01:02.040> 26<00:01:02.730> are

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
occurring is the numbers 21 to 26 are

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.970 
occurring is the numbers 21 to 26 are
being<00:01:03.240> slipped<00:01:03.630> underneath<00:01:03.990> the<00:01:04.170> Edit<00:01:04.710> point

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
being slipped underneath the Edit point

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.710 
being slipped underneath the Edit point
which<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.370> represented<00:01:05.970> by<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> yellow<00:01:06.360> line

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which is represented by the yellow line

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.900 
which is represented by the yellow line
down<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:08.160> are<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.210> call<00:01:09.240> tails

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
down here these are what we call tails

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.030 
down here these are what we call tails
so<00:01:11.910> if<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.330> grab<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> box<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> head<00:01:13.680> back

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so if I grab the box again and head back

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
so if I grab the box again and head back
to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.300> see<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.690> number

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to the right you can see the number

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
to the right you can see the number
frames<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.560> increasing<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> yellow

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
frames are increasing and the yellow

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.180 
frames are increasing and the yellow
line<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.270> decreasing<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.650> can't<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.040> any

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
line is decreasing when I can't go any

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.770 
line is decreasing when I can't go any
further<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.910> right<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.300> learned<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
further to the right I learned that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.750 
further to the right I learned that
there<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.080> no<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.350> tails<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.220> extend<00:01:23.640> this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
there is no more tails to extend this

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.390 
there is no more tails to extend this
shot<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.240> any<00:01:24.450> further<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.350> 26<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
shot out any further because 26 is the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.039 
shot out any further because 26 is the
last<00:01:26.729> number<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.390> clip

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.919 

if<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:31.039> now<00:01:31.189> click<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.729> right<00:01:31.969> trim<00:01:32.299> box<00:01:32.539> there

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
if I now click the right trim box there

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.230 
if I now click the right trim box there
are<00:01:33.079> currently<00:01:33.500> no<00:01:33.829> tiles<00:01:34.219> associated<00:01:35.090> with

left like this and as I do it we can see
tails<00:01:45.890> appear<00:01:46.399> as<00:01:46.610> we<00:01:47.329> continue<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.020> pull<00:01:48.229> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
tails appear as we continue to pull to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.410 
tails appear as we continue to pull to
the<00:01:48.439> left<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.829> tails<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.340> longer<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.270> get

we've got here

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:28.360 
we've got here
16<00:03:21.200> 17<00:03:21.709> 18<00:03:22.249> p<00:03:23.239> qu<00:03:23.840> r<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.650> down<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.579> Zed

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.390 

right<00:03:29.360> now<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:29.959> can<00:03:30.200> move<00:03:30.349> on<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.069> slip

not activate the slip slide menu so take
some<00:03:46.340> time<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.670> learn<00:03:46.790> how<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.030> get<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.330> right

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
some time to learn how to get it right

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.210 
some time to learn how to get it right
you<00:03:48.170> will<00:03:48.349> know<00:03:48.410> when<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.739> get<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.069> right

you will know when you get it right

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.039 
you will know when you get it right
because<00:03:49.670> your<00:03:49.790> segments<00:03:50.299> will<00:03:50.599> go<00:03:50.780> bright

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049

make yellow okay let's start with the

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.259 
make yellow okay let's start with the
move<00:04:05.810> function<00:04:06.400> pressing<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.640> move<00:04:07.880> button

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
move function pressing the move button

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.300 
move function pressing the move button
and<00:04:08.420> dragging<00:04:08.810> moves<00:04:09.049> your<00:04:09.470> segment<00:04:09.920> over

you

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.350 

so<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.799> will<00:04:22.099> however<00:04:22.370> shorten<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.149 
so you will however shorten the
surrounding<00:04:23.870> segment<00:04:24.289> if<00:04:24.409> you<00:04:24.530> go<00:04:24.680> over<00:04:25.009> them

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
surrounding segment if you go over them

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:30.840 
surrounding segment if you go over them
and<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:25.490> move<00:04:25.669> away<00:04:25.849> again<00:04:26.360> like<00:04:26.659> this<00:04:26.840> one

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.290 

the<00:04:31.660> copy<00:04:31.900> button<00:04:32.200> it'll<00:04:33.160> make<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.490> copy<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.970> the

the copy button it'll make a copy of the
segment<00:04:34.720> clip<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.140> we'll<00:04:35.380> drag<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.740> along<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
segment clip and we'll drag it along the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.820 
segment clip and we'll drag it along the
timeline<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:37.390> very<00:04:37.600> useful<00:04:38.140> for<00:04:38.170> repeating
