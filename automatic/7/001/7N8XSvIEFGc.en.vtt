00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.800 

well<00:00:12.580> I<00:00:12.640> think<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:13.000> big<00:00:13.240> problem<00:00:13.450> is<00:00:13.720> to

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:13.810 
well I think the big problem is to

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.540 
well I think the big problem is to
imagine<00:00:14.020> that<00:00:14.320> there<00:00:14.440> is<00:00:14.470> a<00:00:14.590> starting<00:00:15.250> point

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.550 
imagine that there is a starting point

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.820 
imagine that there is a starting point
of<00:00:15.820> anything<00:00:16.180> or<00:00:16.630> even<00:00:16.990> that<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.260> start<00:00:17.500> input

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
of anything or even that the start input

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.390 
of anything or even that the start input
is<00:00:17.980> actually<00:00:18.400> relevant<00:00:18.670> I<00:00:19.950> usually<00:00:20.950> start<00:00:21.190> out

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
is actually relevant I usually start out

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.160 
is actually relevant I usually start out
by<00:00:21.580> finding<00:00:21.820> images<00:00:22.360> that<00:00:22.540> I<00:00:22.570> feel<00:00:22.930> like

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
by finding images that I feel like

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.890 
by finding images that I feel like
copying<00:00:23.770> or<00:00:24.040> using<00:00:24.490> as<00:00:24.610> a<00:00:24.640> storyboard<00:00:25.300> but

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
copying or using as a storyboard but

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.330 
copying or using as a storyboard but
this<00:00:26.050> actually<00:00:26.320> probably<00:00:26.920> doesn't<00:00:27.189> have

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
this actually probably doesn't have

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.490 
this actually probably doesn't have
anything<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:27.820> do<00:00:27.939> with<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.150> final<00:00:28.509> work<00:00:28.660> it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
anything to do with the final work it

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.589 
anything to do with the final work it
gives<00:00:29.740> it<00:00:29.919> a<00:00:29.980> really<00:00:30.130> strict<00:00:30.520> outline<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.450> an

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
gives it a really strict outline and an

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.650 
gives it a really strict outline and an
aesthetic<00:00:32.220> coherence<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.460> integrity<00:00:34.240> and<00:00:34.540> a

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
aesthetic coherence and integrity and a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.560 
aesthetic coherence and integrity and a
rigor<00:00:34.900> and<00:00:35.310> it<00:00:36.310> also<00:00:36.460> helps<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.940> dancers<00:00:37.329> have

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
rigor and it also helps the dancers have

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.370 
rigor and it also helps the dancers have
something<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.110> work<00:00:38.290> from<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.480> also<00:00:40.989> feel

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
something to work from but I also feel

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.810 
something to work from but I also feel
that<00:00:41.410> for<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.770> audience<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.250> know<00:00:42.310> what<00:00:42.610> that

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
that for the audience to know what that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.450 
that for the audience to know what that
path<00:00:43.090> was<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:44.469> let<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:44.949> cat<00:00:45.129> out<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
path was is to let the cat out of the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.220 
path was is to let the cat out of the
bag<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.699> bit<00:00:46.000> what's<00:00:46.270> more<00:00:46.600> interesting<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:47.170> to

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
bag a bit what's more interesting is to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.619 
bag a bit what's more interesting is to
see<00:00:47.379> what<00:00:47.770> is<00:00:47.800> there<00:00:48.190> at<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.520> end<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:49.180> what

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
see what is there at the end and what

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.840 
see what is there at the end and what
does<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:49.840> look<00:00:49.989> like<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.620> for<00:00:51.100> me<00:00:51.250> it's<00:00:51.579> the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
does it look like and for me it's the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.450 
does it look like and for me it's the
biggest<00:00:52.390> surprise<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:53.649> see<00:00:53.859> what<00:00:54.039> comes<00:00:54.280> out

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
biggest surprise to see what comes out

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.799 
biggest surprise to see what comes out
at<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.640> end<00:00:54.850> because<00:00:55.059> it's<00:00:55.300> completely

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
at the end because it's completely

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.419 
at the end because it's completely
unpredictable<00:00:56.050> it's<00:00:56.559> got<00:00:56.710> nothing<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.309> do

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
unpredictable it's got nothing to do

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.279 
unpredictable it's got nothing to do
with<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.699> images<00:00:58.030> or<00:00:58.239> my<00:00:58.390> starting<00:00:58.840> point

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.890 

this<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:02.469> quite<00:01:02.800> an<00:01:03.190> unusual<00:01:03.370> piece<00:01:04.150> for<00:01:04.870> a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
this is quite an unusual piece for a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.470 
this is quite an unusual piece for a
contemporary<00:01:05.530> dance<00:01:05.860> person<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.670> embark<00:01:07.330> on

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
contemporary dance person to embark on

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.880 
contemporary dance person to embark on
it<00:01:07.990> doesn't<00:01:08.200> look<00:01:08.290> like<00:01:08.320> anything<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.770> was

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
it doesn't look like anything I was

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.770 
it doesn't look like anything I was
expecting<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.460> make<00:01:09.640> it's<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.060> very<00:01:10.510> difficult

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
expecting to make it's a very difficult

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.260 
expecting to make it's a very difficult
piece<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.350> work<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:12.280> cues<00:01:12.670> in<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.910> music

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
piece of work the cues in the music

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.540 
piece of work the cues in the music
being<00:01:13.450> played<00:01:13.540> backwards<00:01:14.230> is<00:01:14.710> incredibly

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
being played backwards is incredibly

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.140 
being played backwards is incredibly
difficult<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.720> if<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:18.009> dancers<00:01:18.700> weren't<00:01:18.970> up

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
difficult so if the dancers weren't up

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.880 
difficult so if the dancers weren't up
for<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.840> went<00:01:20.110> up<00:01:20.229> for<00:01:20.439> doing<00:01:20.650> something

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
for it and went up for doing something

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.830 
for it and went up for doing something
very<00:01:21.040> hard<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:21.670> would<00:01:22.150> have<00:01:22.240> discarded<00:01:22.750> this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
very hard I would have discarded this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.569 
very hard I would have discarded this
way<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.140> working<00:01:23.500> but<00:01:23.650> they've<00:01:23.829> encouraged<00:01:24.340> me

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
way of working but they've encouraged me

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.480 
way of working but they've encouraged me
by<00:01:25.210> their<00:01:26.020> attention<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:26.890> detail<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.369> their

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
by their attention to detail and their

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.240 
by their attention to detail and their
enthusiasm<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.110> think<00:01:29.350> my<00:01:29.439> experience<00:01:29.530> here

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
enthusiasm so I think my experience here

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.440 
enthusiasm so I think my experience here
has<00:01:30.280> been<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.880> I've<00:01:31.000> made<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.240> really

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
has been that I've made a really

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.270 
has been that I've made a really
difficult<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.170> bonkers<00:01:32.740> piece<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.100> work

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
difficult and bonkers piece of work

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.280 
difficult and bonkers piece of work
because<00:01:34.030> I've<00:01:34.119> been<00:01:34.240> encouraged<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.869> do<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.020> by

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
because I've been encouraged to do so by

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.080 
because I've been encouraged to do so by
a<00:01:35.890> group<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.310> people<00:01:36.490> who<00:01:36.759> are<00:01:36.790> really

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
a group of people who are really

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.219 
a group of people who are really
outfitting<00:01:37.630> something<00:01:37.960> very<00:01:38.290> different

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
outfitting something very different

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.660 
outfitting something very different
something<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.860> did<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.130> like<00:01:40.280> any<00:01:40.460> other

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
something that did not like any other

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.740 
something that did not like any other
piece<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.060> work<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.210> they've<00:01:41.450> been<00:01:41.630> in

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
piece of work that they've been in

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.719 
piece of work that they've been in
before<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.710> think<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:43.009> speaks<00:01:43.280> for<00:01:43.460> itself

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
before so I think that speaks for itself

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.350 
before so I think that speaks for itself
I<00:01:44.950> think<00:01:45.950> now<00:01:46.460> looking<00:01:46.670> at<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.969> work<00:01:47.149> that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
I think now looking at the work that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.709 
I think now looking at the work that
we've<00:01:47.479> made<00:01:47.719> it's<00:01:48.200> almost<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:49.039> strange

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
we've made it's almost like a strange

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.270 
we've made it's almost like a strange
concentrated<00:01:50.719> backwards<00:01:51.409> inside-out

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
concentrated backwards inside-out

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880 
concentrated backwards inside-out
through<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.850> looking-glass<00:01:53.179> opera<00:01:53.990> that's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
through the looking-glass opera that's

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.559 
through the looking-glass opera that's
been<00:01:55.220> done<00:01:55.490> by<00:01:55.670> people<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:56.179> have<00:01:56.299> never<00:01:56.450> seen

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
been done by people that have never seen

been done by people that have never seen
an<00:01:56.899> opera<00:01:57.259> who<00:01:57.649> have<00:01:57.740> read<00:01:57.920> about<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.429> a

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
an opera who have read about it in a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.460 
an opera who have read about it in a
book<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.909> I'm<00:01:59.060> making<00:01:59.240> their<00:01:59.539> own<00:01:59.569> opera<00:02:00.110> so

book and I'm making their own opera so

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.559 
book and I'm making their own opera so
it<00:02:00.560> bears<00:02:00.770> no<00:02:01.039> resemblance<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.700> anything<00:02:01.969> but

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
it bears no resemblance to anything but

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.620 
it bears no resemblance to anything but
it<00:02:02.719> feels<00:02:03.020> slightly<00:02:03.350> familiar<00:02:03.850> its<00:02:04.850> episodic

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
it feels slightly familiar its episodic

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.270 
it feels slightly familiar its episodic
and<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.170> flows<00:02:06.469> from<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.860> thing<00:02:07.069> to<00:02:07.130> another

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and it flows from one thing to another

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.630 
and it flows from one thing to another
and<00:02:07.969> there<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> coherent<00:02:09.250> aesthetic<00:02:10.250> style

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and there is a coherent aesthetic style

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.809 
and there is a coherent aesthetic style
but<00:02:11.360> what<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.380> about<00:02:12.549> it's<00:02:13.549> for<00:02:13.760> the

but what is it about it's for the

but what is it about it's for the
audience<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.239> get<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:15.049> no<00:02:15.380> idea
