00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.170
 To make the necklace we will recycle 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.130
 nuts that we have at home these are 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.130
 6 mm 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 an extra strong glue 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200
 rings 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.579
 close for what is the necklace of this 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.579
 kind 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 waxed cord this is very finite 2 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 millimeters 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.739
 good varied I have chosen your color 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.140
 red to match the cord 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.379
 these are 8 millimeters and then some 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.649
 Silver crutches that are 4 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.649
 millimeters 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.230
 It would be nice to have a lighter nearby to 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.730
 burn the ends of what is the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.310
 cord 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.590
 and as tools we are going to use the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.590
 flat pliers and round 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.040
 what I'm going to do with the nuts are 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.480
 these figures to later use them 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.750
 for the decoration of what is the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.540
 necklace 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 very easy to assemble I will put a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.610
 plastic because the super glue 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.610
 strong 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.579
 you just have to paste them 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.650
 first two together 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.190
 and then we're going to paste in the part of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190
 above 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.460
 let's wait for it to dry a bit 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.159
 you see and now one in the part 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 and from below be careful because it would not be 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.050
 the first time my fingers stick 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 or a job of this type 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.790
 and then it happens really bad 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.720
 here would be the piece mounted there is that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.720
 let it dry well 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.490
 and now what we are going to do to each one 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.140
 of them is to put your ring they have to 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.270
 be rings big enough 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.140
 so that they take well what is the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.140
 way we have done 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.380
 so let's put it 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.940
 the handle also 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.990
 Now we reserve the pieces with your 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.990
 rings 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.989
 and we are going to cut the waxed cord 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.580
 here is the cut cord 50 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.159
 centimeters because I do not want it very 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.519
 long but I do not want it too stuck 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.519
 to the neck 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.090
 and that a little the ends so that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.410
 be well sealed and not have 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.410
 problems when putting the balls 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.970
 and then let's go well 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 how are we going to put them 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.260
 I'm going to start with little balls 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 here we have one of the silver 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.050
 a red 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.380
 and another silver 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.729
 and now I 'm going to put one of the pieces 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.729
 what we have done 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.980
 let's do that way all that remains of the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.980
 necklace interspersed with the pieces 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.900
 we have sold all 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.900
 and now let's put them of the lands 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.920
 at one extreme we put 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.920
 we have everything to close 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.580
 and on the other end we put a 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.560
 small chain 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.710
 with a pair of rings in my case I 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.660
 I would have left over because I want me to stay 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.120
 it has been very fair in size 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.670
 for what I wanted then but good 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.940
 If you want to put more chains you can 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.970
 make it clear 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.300
 and we have finished already you see how fast 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.620
 in no time you have done it I think 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.930
 which is a good idea I love 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.870
 recycle I think we should recycle 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.970
 much more than we do and 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.910
 good to take a few nuts that 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.060
 I had at home that I never use 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.070
 I seem to like the idea a lot 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.590
 so well then I hope in the next 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.340
 video please give me a like me 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.160

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.890

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.280
