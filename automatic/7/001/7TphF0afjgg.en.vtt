so she's you got your little snaps here
at<00:06:19.789> the<00:06:19.910> bottom<00:06:21.190> which<00:06:22.630> pulls<00:06:23.630> out<00:06:23.949> looks<00:06:24.949> like

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
at the bottom which pulls out looks like

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.870 
at the bottom which pulls out looks like
it<00:06:25.280> takes<00:06:25.460> it<00:06:25.699> up<00:06:25.820> to<00:06:26.000> about<00:06:26.270> four<00:06:26.630> feet<00:06:26.900> or<00:06:27.139> so

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
it takes it up to about four feet or so

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.080 
it takes it up to about four feet or so

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
for the height of the tripod and then

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.390 
for the height of the tripod and then
the<00:06:32.300> little<00:06:32.740> adjuster<00:06:33.740> at<00:06:33.889> the<00:06:34.009> top<00:06:36.070> pop<00:06:37.070> takes

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
the little adjuster at the top pop takes
