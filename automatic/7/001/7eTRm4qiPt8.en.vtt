00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.580

 satisfaction that the military of

 promotion is valid only this month on 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.350
 my mascara is a deep black color 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.770
 but the version is also available for sale 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.750
 blue and burgundy the bottle brush and medium 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.699
 size and with regard to the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.129
 pipe brush structure and a lot 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 particular and innovative was 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.430
 made with the technology of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.979
 snowflakes ie snowflakes 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 there are two types of 20 in which long 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 and hard and are the ones that create the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 volume instead of small teeth and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 soft are the people responsible for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 length and separation of the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 eyelashes I tell you now what is me 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
 liked in this but stopover 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 I simply fell in love with 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 this mascara since the first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 application 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.909
 I was convinced that a mascara cannot 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.369
 give me everything I need that is 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 of a substantial volume of a good 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.840
 length and a beautiful one 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.240
 incurvatura but I must say that I am 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.990
 impressed by all of these 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.479
 points of view then I liked 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.180
 very much the fact that the volume is the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.310
 length increases quickly enough 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.340
 a few passes and here is yours 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.020
 look refuses very intense and with two 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.850
 three more passes you get a 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.850
 result similar to false eyelashes 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.489
 the consistency of the mascara is enough 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.730
 fluid and creamy therefore the application is 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.769
 very easy 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.110
 another positive aspect is that 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.480
 eyelashes always remain bent also 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.099
 after the application this thanks to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.220
 fact that the mascara dries 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.260
 fast enough 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.440
 the evolved chanel mascara stands up well 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.840
 moisture and does not create citrus fruit separates 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.720
 just fine until the mascara on 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 eyelashes don't start to dry out 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.290
 otherwise the eyelashes can be 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.019
 paste a little bit and you can create 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.970
 of the small gum therefore my 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.220
 advice is to stay fast enough 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.860
 in the preface precisely to avoid the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.420
 minor inconveniences 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.840
 the only thing I didn't like very much 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.760
 and that I must always use a lotion 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.069
 specific to remove make-up because this 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.090
 mascara and apparently resistant though 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.129
 it is not a waterproof version 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.590
 now i 'm going over the 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.840
 chile of the right eye so you will have way 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.430
 to notice the difference between an eye and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.430
 the other in the following photo 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.640
 so my vote is 9 out of 10 if i have to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.310
 be honest in my ranking of 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.690
 top mascara the volute scene of the mascara 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.870
 now takes first place there 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.870
 to the next
