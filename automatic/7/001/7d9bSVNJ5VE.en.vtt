in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.899> net<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.320> easily

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
in the net very easily

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.730 
in the net very easily
we've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.000> landing<00:02:00.360> net<00:02:00.540> set<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:00.990> right

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we've got your landing net set up right

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.429 
we've got your landing net set up right
next<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> box<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.790> you're<00:02:03.000> left-handed

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
next to the box now you're left-handed

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
next to the box now you're left-handed
so<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.649> why<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> nets<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:06.000> side

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
so that's why the nets on the right side

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.130 
so that's why the nets on the right side
but<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.740> maximising<00:02:08.640> your

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
but it's all about maximising your

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
but it's all about maximising your
tackle<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.679> efficiently<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.520> your<00:02:11.730> peg<00:02:11.910> okay

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
tackle very efficiently on your peg okay

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
tackle very efficiently on your peg okay
so<00:02:12.480> once<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.050> there

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so once you're there

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
so once you're there
you<00:02:13.739> set<00:02:14.040> you're<00:02:14.700> ready<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.090> roll<00:02:15.360> yeah<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
you set you're ready to roll yeah and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.059 
you set you're ready to roll yeah and
you<00:02:16.049> can<00:02:16.260> keep<00:02:16.439> moving

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
you can keep moving

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.670 
you can keep moving
that's<00:02:17.310> salute<00:02:17.640> ok<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.599> we've<00:02:18.780> got<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
that's salute ok I see we've got the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.220 
that's salute ok I see we've got the
poll<00:02:19.920> back<00:02:20.189> here<00:02:20.519> James<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> explain

poll back here James can you explain
about<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.680> well<00:02:22.829> that's<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.819> know<00:02:23.939> we're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
about that well that's as you know we're

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.179 
about that well that's as you know we're
going<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.269> fish<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.659> long<00:02:24.930> pole<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.980> we

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
going to fish with a long pole so we

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.580 
going to fish with a long pole so we
have<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.489> actually<00:02:26.849> ship<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.360> pole<00:02:27.599> in<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
have to actually ship the pole in and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.059 
have to actually ship the pole in and
out<00:02:29.010> doing<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> fish<00:02:30.780> catching<00:02:31.170> process<00:02:31.680> ok

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
out doing the fish catching process ok

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.229 
out doing the fish catching process ok
so<00:02:32.430> relax<00:02:32.730> using<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.239> pole<00:02:33.480> roller<00:02:34.909> which<00:02:35.909> helps

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
so relax using a pole roller which helps

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.660 
so relax using a pole roller which helps
make<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.569> job<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.260> easy<00:02:37.409> you'll<00:02:38.280> notice

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
make the job really easy you'll notice

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.720 
make the job really easy you'll notice
that<00:02:38.790> I've<00:02:38.939> positioned<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.510> pole<00:02:39.720> roller

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
that I've positioned the pole roller

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.309 
that I've positioned the pole roller
about<00:02:41.730> half<00:02:41.970> way<00:02:42.269> back<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.840> terms<00:02:43.079> of<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
about half way back in terms of the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.530 
about half way back in terms of the
distance<00:02:43.709> from<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.010> box<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> length<00:02:45.390> of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
distance from the box to the length of

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330 
distance from the box to the length of
the<00:02:45.659> pole<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.470> case<00:02:46.739> we're<00:02:46.950> fishing<00:02:47.220> with

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the pole in this case we're fishing with

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640 
the pole in this case we're fishing with
8<00:02:47.489> meters<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.120> start<00:02:48.389> with<00:02:48.629> so<00:02:49.260> I've<00:02:49.349> got<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
8 meters to start with so I've got the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.740 
8 meters to start with so I've got the
pole<00:02:49.859> roll<00:02:50.069> around<00:02:50.280> about<00:02:50.700> four<00:02:51.000> meters<00:02:51.510> four

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
pole roll around about four meters four

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.599 
pole roll around about four meters four
and<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> half<00:02:51.930> meters<00:02:52.230> back<00:02:52.889> from<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.250> fishing

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
and a half meters back from the fishing

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.520 
and a half meters back from the fishing
station<00:02:54.120> okay<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.659> that<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:54.840> simply<00:02:55.349> means

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
station okay so that just simply means

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.250 
station okay so that just simply means
that<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.849> ship<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> pole<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that you can ship the pole out on the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.580 
that you can ship the pole out on the
roller<00:02:59.209> backwards<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.359> forwards<00:03:00.870> very

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
roller backwards and forwards very

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.349 
roller backwards and forwards very
smoothly<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.280> easily<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.819> can<00:03:02.939> see<00:03:03.150> how<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
smoothly and easily you can see how the

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.190 
smoothly and easily you can see how the
roll<00:03:03.659> is<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:04.530> stable<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.720> obviously<00:03:06.720> helped

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
roll is very stable and obviously helped

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.309 
roll is very stable and obviously helped
yeah<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> perfect<00:03:09.629> balance<00:03:09.780> point<00:03:10.230> for

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
yeah it's the perfect balance point for

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.470 
yeah it's the perfect balance point for
the<00:03:10.500> length<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.920> pole<00:03:11.129> that<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.370> use<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.939> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the length of pole that you use it and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.699 
the length of pole that you use it and
the<00:03:12.599> other<00:03:12.720> thing<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.079> think<00:03:13.109> about<00:03:13.530> when

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the other thing to think about when

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
the other thing to think about when
you're<00:03:13.859> using<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.280> pole<00:03:14.489> well<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:14.970> it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you're using a pole well that is it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.900 
you're using a pole well that is it
keeps<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.780> pole<00:03:15.989> off<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.379> ground<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> it's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
keeps the pole off the ground so it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.729 
keeps the pole off the ground so it's
more<00:03:18.090> visible<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.750> know<00:03:19.199> if<00:03:19.319> somebody's

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
more visible you know if somebody's

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.229 
more visible you know if somebody's
walking<00:03:19.919> along<00:03:20.430> they're<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.120> to

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
walking along they're going to have to

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.939 
walking along they're going to have to
leave<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.419> walk<00:03:21.660> around<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.079> will<00:03:22.199> walk<00:03:22.379> over<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
leave a walk around it will walk over it

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.619 
leave a walk around it will walk over it
rather<00:03:23.340> than<00:03:23.549> maybe<00:03:23.699> not<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.389> tread

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
rather than maybe not see it and tread

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.259 
rather than maybe not see it and tread
on<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.220> you're<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.250> gonna<00:03:26.489> damage<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.970> end

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
on it so you're not gonna damage the end

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.089 
on it so you're not gonna damage the end
of<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.480> pole<00:03:27.690> by<00:03:27.930> running<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.560> back<00:03:28.709> over

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
of the pole by running it back over

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.740 
of the pole by running it back over
rough<00:03:29.280> ground<00:03:29.310> absolutely<00:03:30.299> if<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.569> were<00:03:30.629> to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
rough ground absolutely if you were to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.780 
rough ground absolutely if you were to
do<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:30.959> if<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.379> were<00:03:31.470> literally<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.010> ship

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
do that if you were literally to ship

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.729 
do that if you were literally to ship
the<00:03:32.909> pole<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.359> ground<00:03:33.750> you'd<00:03:34.109> get<00:03:34.349> grit

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the pole on the ground you'd get grit

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.449 
the pole on the ground you'd get grit
and<00:03:35.069> all<00:03:35.220> sorts<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:36.409> dirt<00:03:37.409> in<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.859> inside<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and all sorts of dirt in the inside the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.039 
and all sorts of dirt in the inside the
pole<00:03:38.699> that's<00:03:38.879> going<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> damage<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.599> pole<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
pole that's going to damage the pole and

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.839 
pole that's going to damage the pole and
cause<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.379> problems<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.069> where<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.609> pull

cause you problems and where you pull

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.509 
cause you problems and where you pull
out<00:03:41.879> basically<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.079> maximizing<00:03:43.949> the
