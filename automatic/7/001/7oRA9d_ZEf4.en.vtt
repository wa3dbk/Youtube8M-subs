00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.500
 of course have 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.510
 Sergey Tigipko 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.379
 when by energy visa 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.709
 each other 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.969
 thanks to this attention 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210
 around noon 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.320
 some other side 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
 but I thought it was 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.179
 second and third goal 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.999
 the situation is not easy 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.159
 person 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.790
 during the trip read 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 as stated in the message and again 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.060
 shooting the hosts 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.180
 therefore refusal 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.450
 Moscow 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590
 need to understand correctly first she 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 can not be 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 for us it was very important 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 if there are children 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.670
 and the bagmet itself is less criticism 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 for one night from 29 to 30 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880
 this is reached by land 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.730
 how many were 15 years old 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.770
 especially good 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.110
 and secondly complexity five times 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.370
 the most difficult 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.040
 It is believed that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 What do you think it means if you count 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.210
 band musicians 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630
 puzzling 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.920
 that is, he is now 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.820
 Andrei Radin 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.260
 this is a very necessary amount 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
 we consider ourselves 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.470
 brand to quarantine vkontakte network 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 make the initiator of such trading houses 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.150
 that is, it is a sale of weapons 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.110
 according to g on the bone 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.230
 the third part of Russian history 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.270
 wounded Sergei Sidorsky living and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.110
 working world 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 in St. Petersburg laboratory 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.900
 computer confirmed 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 on Wednesday in the press release of the Bank of Russia 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.309
 but generally I'm a minute 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.139
 taste by and large he is nothing 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.000
 no one can say 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.190
 add also that he 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.940
 portfolios of developments that are to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 bring market share going on but not 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.259
 would call would play 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.389
 and here are its advantages 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.709
 Vasily Kiselev while smoking 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.739
 for example fall 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.639
 is impossible 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.789
 we congratulate you 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.729
 shocking 10 years later were signed 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.289
 new blood is used in the rental 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.199
 what is it yes 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 one more time in my life 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.769
 as stated in the letter 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.559
 nobody is answering 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.889
 amnesty 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.909
 scale 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.609
 North American division 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.999
 by the organizers 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.639
 we can do it 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.659
 optimism 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.519
 in particular will 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.609
 to the question why 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.439
 if the parents still have it 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.469
 the fact that the phone shocks are long 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.540
 history with fitch provided 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.329
 still 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.859
 we are in big doubt that 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.629
 Agricultural Bank is not in a hurry except 800 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.689
 the enemies have it too of course you have to become 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.919
 executioner 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.639
 frankly except for 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.889
 of course says a lot when needed 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.699
 stopping her won't mean that 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.139
 examine the opponent 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.799
