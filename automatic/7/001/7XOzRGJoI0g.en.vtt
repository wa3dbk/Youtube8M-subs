on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> galaxy<00:01:36.119> s4<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.770> should<00:01:38.189> be

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
on the galaxy s4 and you should be

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.010 
on the galaxy s4 and you should be
getting<00:01:39.950> some<00:01:40.950> better<00:01:41.759> maybe<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.810> better

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
getting some better maybe some better

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
getting some better maybe some better
durability<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> galaxy<00:01:44.460> round

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
durability here on the galaxy round

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
durability here on the galaxy round
gives<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> curved<00:01:45.689> display<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
gives it's a curved display so first of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
gives it's a curved display so first of
course<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.119> crib<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.689> bit<00:01:48.780> more

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
course is the crib a little bit more

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
course is the crib a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> hold<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.280> starting<00:01:51.180> off

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
comfortable to hold and starting off

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.609 
comfortable to hold and starting off
right<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.380> bit<00:01:52.500> more

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
right there a little bit more

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.730 
right there a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:53.009> 20<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.590> it's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
comfortable 20 but then when when it's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
comfortable 20 but then when when it's
like<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> curved<00:01:56.399> display<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.969> problem<00:01:57.299> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
like a curved display the problem is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.060 
like a curved display the problem is
that<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.930> could<00:01:58.200> take<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.740> bit<00:01:58.890> more

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that it could take a little bit more

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520 
that it could take a little bit more
pain<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:01:59.820> more<00:02:00.090> damage<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
pain a little more damage and so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.789 
pain a little more damage and so
hopefully<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.520> will<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.450> awesome<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.619> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
hopefully it will be awesome in that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.980 
hopefully it will be awesome in that
area<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.189> hopefully<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.880> unveil<00:02:06.689> an
