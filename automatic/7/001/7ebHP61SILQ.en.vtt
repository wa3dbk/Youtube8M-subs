take care of they will get nipped you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.099 
take care of they will get nipped you
just<00:03:39.400> like<00:03:39.519> your<00:03:39.670> bogan<00:03:39.910> via<00:03:40.090> they<00:03:40.720> will<00:03:40.959> get

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
just like your bogan via they will get

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.470 
just like your bogan via they will get
knit<00:03:41.350> back<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> cold<00:03:42.549> if<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.910> freezes

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
knit back in with a cold if it freezes

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.170 
knit back in with a cold if it freezes
how<00:03:44.410> far<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.920> freeze<00:03:45.190> backs<00:03:45.459> depends<00:03:46.090> upon

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
how far they freeze backs depends upon

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.470 
how far they freeze backs depends upon
how<00:03:46.450> cold<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.900> gets<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.799> how<00:03:47.980> many

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
how cold it gets in and how many

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.300 
how cold it gets in and how many
subsequent<00:03:49.480> days<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.930> gets<00:03:50.079> cold<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:51.160> they

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
subsequent days that gets cold but they

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.520 
subsequent days that gets cold but they
can<00:03:51.459> freeze<00:03:51.730> almost<00:03:52.420> entirely<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.140> ground

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
can freeze almost entirely to the ground

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.830 
can freeze almost entirely to the ground
but<00:03:54.250> they<00:03:54.430> are<00:03:54.579> what<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:54.910> call<00:03:54.940> root<00:03:55.390> Hardy

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
but they are what they call root Hardy

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.410 
but they are what they call root Hardy
which<00:03:56.050> means<00:03:56.409> they<00:03:57.310> will<00:03:57.459> come<00:03:57.730> back<00:03:58.000> from<00:03:58.300> the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
which means they will come back from the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.760 
which means they will come back from the
roots<00:03:58.659> even<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.500> fall

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
roots even the fall

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.010 
roots even the fall
year<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.280> same<00:04:00.490> as<00:04:00.610> bougainvillea<00:04:01.060> once

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
year the same as bougainvillea once

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.810 
year the same as bougainvillea once
bogan<00:04:02.380> view<00:04:02.530> get<00:04:02.740> established<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.460> can<00:04:03.550> freeze

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
bogan view get established it can freeze

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.820 
bogan view get established it can freeze
all<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.270> way<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.570> ground<00:04:04.780> it'll<00:04:05.560> just

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
all the way to the ground it'll just

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.310 
all the way to the ground it'll just
come<00:04:06.010> right<00:04:06.280> back<00:04:06.900> from<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:08.110> root<00:04:08.290> system

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
come right back from that root system

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.100 
come right back from that root system
the<00:04:08.860> same<00:04:09.070> with<00:04:09.310> these<00:04:09.520> guys<00:04:09.790> once<00:04:10.690> they<00:04:10.900> kind

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
the same with these guys once they kind

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.870 
the same with these guys once they kind
of<00:04:11.170> get<00:04:11.320> enough<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:12.070> root<00:04:12.280> system<00:04:12.460> going

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
of get enough of a root system going

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.980 
of get enough of a root system going
then<00:04:13.030> they're<00:04:13.150> okay<00:04:13.480> they'll<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.810> come

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
then they're okay they'll just come

yeah<00:04:28.290> once<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.470> plant<00:04:29.740> them<00:04:29.920> if<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.160> were<00:04:30.250> going

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
yeah once you plant them if I were going

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.730 
yeah once you plant them if I were going
to<00:04:30.430> plant<00:04:30.670> this<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.030> my<00:04:31.120> yard<00:04:31.330> today<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:32.110> would

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
to plant this in my yard today I would

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.380 
to plant this in my yard today I would
plant<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.400> would<00:04:33.550> water<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.000> every<00:04:34.120> day

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
plant it and I would water it every day

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.960 
plant it and I would water it every day
for<00:04:35.290> two<00:04:35.470> weeks<00:04:35.740> depending<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.400> how<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.670> cuts

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
for two weeks depending on how it cuts

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.330 
for two weeks depending on how it cuts
maybe<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.360> month<00:04:37.690> just<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.740> kind<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.040> get<00:04:39.190> it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
maybe a month just to kind of get it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.190 
maybe a month just to kind of get it
established<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.270> then<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.780> would<00:04:40.960> probably

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
established and then I would probably

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200 
established and then I would probably
through<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:41.920> first<00:04:42.130> summer<00:04:42.460> water<00:04:42.790> at<00:04:42.970> every

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
through this first summer water at every

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.350 
through this first summer water at every
other<00:04:43.360> day<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.080> then<00:04:44.740> by<00:04:44.980> next<00:04:45.040> summer<00:04:45.970> when

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
other day and then by next summer when

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.420 
other day and then by next summer when
the<00:04:46.450> heat<00:04:46.660> hits<00:04:46.690> again<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:48.010> should<00:04:48.220> be<00:04:48.340> able

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
the heat hits again you should be able

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
the heat hits again you should be able
to<00:04:48.580> get<00:04:48.700> away<00:04:48.790> with<00:04:49.180> three<00:04:49.870> times<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.290> week<00:04:50.320> or

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
to get away with three times a week or

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.320 
to get away with three times a week or
maybe<00:04:50.860> even<00:04:50.920> twice<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.340> week<00:04:51.670> watering<00:04:52.150> it

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
maybe even twice a week watering it

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.350 
maybe even twice a week watering it
depends<00:04:53.050> upon<00:04:53.440> your<00:04:53.680> soil<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.460> your<00:04:54.760> area<00:04:55.180> and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
depends upon your soil and your area and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.060 
depends upon your soil and your area and
everything<00:04:55.570> but<00:04:56.260> they<00:04:56.380> can<00:04:56.560> take<00:04:56.740> full

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
everything but they can take full

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.090 
everything but they can take full
blasting<00:04:57.730> Sun<00:04:58.200> another<00:04:59.200> advantage<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.770> them

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
blasting Sun another advantage to them

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.830 
blasting Sun another advantage to them
is<00:05:00.220> they're<00:05:00.370> not<00:05:00.520> thorny<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.330> bougainvillea

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
is they're not thorny like bougainvillea

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.930 
is they're not thorny like bougainvillea
so<00:05:02.770> when<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:03.010> have<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.250> cut<00:05:03.400> them<00:05:03.490> back<00:05:03.670> in<00:05:03.850> the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
so when you have to cut them back in the
