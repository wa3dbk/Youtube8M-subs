00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 far away from Brussels deep in the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750
 south german province south of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 Tuebingen have a few left, however 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.110
 Learn how the power rules the EU 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.570
 function 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.660
 The beekeepers wanted to protect their honey 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.920
 and route the profit expectations 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.390
 international food companies too 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 All this began to ponder 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 a beekeeper what was actually in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 his honey is in it for our bees 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 fly up here in the valley in the spring 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 Erlewein dandelion and at the latest then 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.399
 when the dandelion is through and the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 Farmers come with, for example, rapeseed 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 or later then in the summer mostly then 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 Of course, the question is up there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.570
 genetic engineering with the cultivation or not 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.920
 only if the bees in their flight radius 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.270
 none from five to ten kilometers 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.610
 flower pollen from genetically engineered 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.680
 collecting modified plants is also 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.170
 the nectar and the honey are guaranteed 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.920
 GMO-free that's for beekeepers 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.690
 important for various importhonige in the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.690
 whole supermarkets are therefore also 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.860
 so cheap are usually 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.350
 a mix of a bit 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.660
 European and a bit 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.400
 international and of course not 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.310
 ensures that you are GMO-free 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 are GMO free for many beekeepers 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.229
 now an important one 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.660
 market the sales argument accordingly 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.490
 Thomas Radetzki and his beekeeper colleagues 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.259
 your honey with a special 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.860
 Labeling a label we have on 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.160
 our honey a label without genetic engineering 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.840
 that it is an official label of the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.280
 Federal Ministry of Food 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 certified GMO -free 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.799
 be and that will be controlled 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.549
 Of course, and we prove it 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.750
 about whether in the radius of flight of our bible 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.830
 genetic engineering is grown or not 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 for years fought the beekeeper before 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.619
 dishes on genetic engineering vienna and honey 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.299
 At the end, a small label stood for 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.100
 the eu to a big and 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.920
 could become a fundamental problem 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.350
 because in free trade something like 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 the label of beekeepers as a disadvantage 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.269
 Foreign honey can be considered as 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.210
 trade barrier as the lobbyist us 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.730
 andreas geiger confirmed 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.920
 I can do that for quite a while 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.590
 protectionist purposes use by 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.690
 I just ask the consumer demand 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.680
 my certified product 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.830
 Steer here it would be just then we live 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 our products as well and on the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.930
 American writing will be on it 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.980
 be careful what then turn of the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.990
 Americans rightly so 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.710
 protectionist measure 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.110
 would 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.480
 the european head of the chamber of commerce 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.130
 Finds today with the label 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.130
 it drives the eu too far 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.790
 Europe has a very strict like me 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.600
 would say 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.130
 no can not say very strict 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.580
 labeling obligation as I say 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.650
 it makes no political sense 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.420
 but in paradise just believed the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.480
 labeling of foodstuffs 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.640
 Europe's environment and consumer protection 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.580
 decisive progress 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.740
 my motivation is that if we are 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.690
 the protection claim of him can for 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.330
 your honey does not just prevail in 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.130
 germany but the whole of Europe 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.300
 GM crop cultivation prevent that altogether 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.830
 Simply a strategy with the beekeeper 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.900
 initially surprisingly successful 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.520
 the eu court confirmed 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.280
 finally it must be marked 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.020
 become 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.910
 a great thing because of the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.320
 European Court of Justice is right 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.390
 We have given that for years 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.210
 Fought and we are always again 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.380
 flew out of the procedural steps 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.530
 but then the eu commission was upside down 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.040
 the federal government that 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.940
 Department of Agriculture has none 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.640
 expected 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.680
 The beekeepers should use all the genetic engineering 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.870
 to turn debate on its head and thus 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.210
 also the eu's free trade strategy 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.700
 a few beekeepers against the rest of the world 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.250
 came from the World Trade Organization 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.150
 against pressure on the eu commission itself 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.820
 more open to genetic engineering 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.430
 impression behind the usa stood like 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.449
 the eu general director for trade open 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.400
 Gives idea free it is true and that 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.650
 is something our American 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.810
 friends very worried it is true that we 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 but have been convicted by the wto 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.919
 not for our legislation 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.169
 genetically modified foods 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.900
 but for us as in excessive 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:54.600
 hesitantly judged approval of the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.400
 had genetically modified foods 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.320
 in the usa, a court case in 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.160
 framework of the World Trade Organization 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.289
 we won 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.940
 europe has a new system for 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.710
 scientific evaluation of 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.750
 different varieties of genetically modified 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.930
 developed and leaves products 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.930
 to 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.850
 the eu commission sought and found one 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.979
 spectacular way to the decision 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.080
 of the European Court of Justice 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:26.389
 she explained by policy change 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.970
 Do not pollute as an ingredient of honey thomas 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.190
 Radetzki soon received a letter 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.010
 the conservative group in the parliament 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.410
 he should finally give up now 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.020
 The beekeepers should finally have their honey 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.919
 from the GMO discussion out 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.500
 because we are the main problem for 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.449
 the enforcement of genetic engineering in the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.280
 area because we have been very much for years 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.280
 successful in the courts
