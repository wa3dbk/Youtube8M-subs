00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
stitching if you look closely at the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.770 
stitching if you look closely at the
dial

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
dial

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.280 
dial
you'll<00:01:12.780> tell<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.770> taken<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
you'll tell that it is taken one of the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
you'll tell that it is taken one of the
styles<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.910> aviator<00:01:17.910> watches<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
styles of aviator watches where you have

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160 
styles of aviator watches where you have
a<00:01:19.050> central<00:01:19.650> ring<00:01:20.010> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> hours<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a central ring for the hours and the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
a central ring for the hours and the
larger<00:01:23.070> rings<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.550> minutes<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:23.970> makes

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
larger rings for the minutes that makes

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.000 
larger rings for the minutes that makes
a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.450> more<00:01:24.510> sense<00:01:24.690> because<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.440> hour<00:01:25.620> hand

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
a lot more sense because the hour hand

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.370 
a lot more sense because the hour hand
is<00:01:26.190> shorter<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> hour<00:01:27.240> hand<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.780> follows

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
is shorter so the hour hand here follows

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.790 
is shorter so the hour hand here follows
the<00:01:28.950> hours<00:01:29.400> while<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.540> minute<00:01:31.080> hand<00:01:31.290> follows

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
the hours while the minute hand follows

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.740 
the hours while the minute hand follows
the<00:01:32.040> larger<00:01:32.460> ring<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> minute<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the larger ring with a minute so it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.790 
the larger ring with a minute so it's
supposed<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.050> make<00:01:34.230> more<00:01:34.410> sense<00:01:34.560> than<00:01:34.710> they

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
supposed to make more sense than they

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.130 
supposed to make more sense than they
have<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.010> off<00:01:35.160> centered<00:01:35.690> subsidiary<00:01:36.690> seconds

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
have an off centered subsidiary seconds

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.550 
have an off centered subsidiary seconds
