00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.970 
dirty
the<00:01:00.890> bikes<00:01:01.130> only<00:01:01.370> done<00:01:01.610> 15,000<00:01:02.480> K<00:01:02.800> it's<00:01:03.800> a

the bikes only done 15,000 K it's a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.590 
the bikes only done 15,000 K it's a
mystery<00:01:04.370> as<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.879> gets<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.330> dirty

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
mystery as to how it gets this dirty

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.330 
mystery as to how it gets this dirty
when<00:01:05.900> it's<00:01:06.050> supposed<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.500> be<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.680> sealed<00:01:06.979> system

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.090 

anyway<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:11.119> put<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.570> cover<00:01:12.530> back<00:01:12.619> on

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
without putting the screws on this is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.460 
without putting the screws on this is

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
needed because when you bleed the the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.280 
needed because when you bleed the the
clutch<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.310> fluid<00:01:19.640> will<00:01:19.820> squirt<00:01:20.150> out<00:01:20.360> unless

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
clutch the fluid will squirt out unless

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.330 
clutch the fluid will squirt out unless
the<00:01:21.590> cap<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:24.619> get<00:01:24.830> your<00:01:25.040> ring
