00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:02:06.000 

so<00:01:29.120> here's<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.750> decal<00:01:31.570> answer<00:01:32.570> stickers

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:25.660 

she√≠ll<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.250> really<00:02:07.670> big

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.679 

screws

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:38.809 

instruction<00:02:30.689> manual<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:38.129> construction

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
instruction manual the construction

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:50.890 
instruction manual the construction
manual<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.209> pretty<00:02:39.450> thick

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:04.400 

so<00:02:51.900> that's<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.319> for<00:02:52.470> box<00:02:52.709> one<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.959> box

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
so that's it for box one and here is box

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
so that's it for box one and here is box
B<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.140> has<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.650> mechanical<00:03:11.520> base

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
B so it has that little mechanical base

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:26.979 
B so it has that little mechanical base
a<00:03:21.320> some<00:03:22.320> chrome<00:03:22.590> parts<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.770> more<00:03:25.980> screws<00:03:26.370> and
