time<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.129> wearing<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> belt<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.939> a<00:03:26.970> subtle

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
time is wearing a belt so a subtle

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:38.280 
time is wearing a belt so a subtle
variation<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.810> by<00:03:27.989> having<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.290> belt

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.509 

yeah<00:03:41.739> another<00:03:42.739> variation<00:03:43.010> if<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.370> have<00:03:43.489> a

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
yeah another variation if you have a

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.880 
yeah another variation if you have a
platform<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:44.150> has<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:45.170> ability<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.500> strap

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
platform that has the ability to strap

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.110 
platform that has the ability to strap
bands<00:03:46.099> down<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.519> can<00:03:46.610> take<00:03:46.760> some<00:03:46.910> reds

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
bands down to it you can take some reds

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.940 
bands down to it you can take some reds
and<00:03:47.239> double<00:03:47.540> them<00:03:47.660> up<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:48.440> get<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.590> heavy<00:03:48.769> band

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
and double them up to get a heavy band

00:03:48.950 --> 00:04:00.610 
and double them up to get a heavy band
pull<00:03:58.810> those<00:03:59.810> bands<00:04:00.080> don't<00:04:00.140> look<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.410> much<00:04:00.560> of

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
pull those bands don't look like much of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.900 
pull those bands don't look like much of
the<00:04:00.799> kick<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.069> harlots<00:04:01.430> are<00:04:01.549> they<00:04:01.760> kicking

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
the kick and harlots are they kicking

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.100 
the kick and harlots are they kicking
hard<00:04:02.180> at<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.330> top

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
hard at the top

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.780 
hard at the top
all<00:04:03.680> right<00:04:03.799> one<00:04:03.950> more<00:04:04.040> variation<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.580> can<00:04:04.610> do

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
all right one more variation you can do

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.729 
all right one more variation you can do
is<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.120> hang<00:04:05.360> bands<00:04:05.660> from<00:04:05.959> above<00:04:06.319> doing<00:04:06.590> a

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
is you can hang bands from above doing a

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.620 
is you can hang bands from above doing a
reverse<00:04:07.190> band<00:04:07.700> pull<00:04:08.030> where<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.329> bands<00:04:08.480> give

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
reverse band pull where the bands give

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.910 
reverse band pull where the bands give
you<00:04:08.720> some<00:04:08.870> tension<00:04:09.200> at<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.410> bottom<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.799> then

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
you some tension at the bottom and then

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.979 
you some tension at the bottom and then
as<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.190> picks<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.549> up<00:04:10.640> no<00:04:11.209> more<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.750> more<00:04:11.900> of

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
as you picks it up no more and more of

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.630 
as you picks it up no more and more of
the<00:04:12.049> weight<00:04:12.200> on<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.560> bar<00:04:12.769> ends<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.549> his

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
the weight on the bar ends up in his

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.979 
the weight on the bar ends up in his
hands<00:04:13.880> because<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.239> band<00:04:14.420> tension<00:04:14.569> team<00:04:14.900> is

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
hands because the band tension team is

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.000 
hands because the band tension team is
helping<00:04:15.260> him<00:04:15.380> out<00:04:15.470> anymore<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.799> case

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
helping him out anymore so in this case

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.530 
helping him out anymore so in this case
is<00:04:19.130> pulling<00:04:19.370> sumo<00:04:19.700> with<00:04:19.790> with<00:04:20.120> reverse<00:04:20.479> bands

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
is pulling sumo with with reverse bands

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.430 
is pulling sumo with with reverse bands
regular<00:04:23.540> shoes<00:04:23.780> no<00:04:24.260> belt

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.500 

alright<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:28.370> we<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.580> all<00:04:28.789> these<00:04:29.060> different

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
alright so we have all these different

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.210 
alright so we have all these different
variations<00:04:29.780> we've<00:04:30.260> got<00:04:30.380> reverse<00:04:30.680> fans<00:04:30.979> we<00:04:31.100> got

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
variations we've got reverse fans we got

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.490 
variations we've got reverse fans we got
bands<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:31.700> got<00:04:31.850> our<00:04:32.240> stance<00:04:32.750> width<00:04:33.199> for

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
bands we got our stance width for

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.840 
bands we got our stance width for
whether<00:04:33.650> you're<00:04:33.800> doing<00:04:33.949> sumos<00:04:34.340> or<00:04:34.550> regular

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
whether you're doing sumos or regular

whether you're doing sumos or regular
pulls<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.570> don't<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.870> even<00:04:35.930> have<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
pulls you don't have to even have the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.409 
pulls you don't have to even have the
same<00:04:36.650> stance<00:04:36.949> for<00:04:37.160> each<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.490> every<00:04:37.669> sumo<00:04:38.389> you

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
same stance for each and every sumo you

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.790 
same stance for each and every sumo you
do<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> could<00:04:38.870> be<00:04:38.930> super<00:04:39.169> wide<00:04:39.350> on<00:04:39.500> one<00:04:39.650> and

with<00:04:43.220> just<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.520> subtle<00:04:43.850> variation<00:04:44.139> we<00:04:45.139> have<00:04:45.169> a

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
with just a subtle variation we have a

different<00:04:50.720> combinations<00:04:50.900> there<00:04:51.560> in<00:04:51.770> you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
different combinations there in you

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.529 
different combinations there in you
could<00:04:52.130> be<00:04:52.190> doing<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.849> could<00:04:52.940> be<00:04:53.030> doing<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.330> rack

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.300 
weightlifting shoes on and no belt
once<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.380> piece<00:04:57.680> all<00:04:57.860> those<00:04:58.010> things<00:04:58.190> together

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
once you piece all those things together

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.409 
once you piece all those things together
you<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.760> hundreds<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.270> different

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
you have hundreds of different

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.690 
you have hundreds of different
variations<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.200> you<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.440> possibly<00:05:01.010> do<00:05:01.430> as

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
variations that you can possibly do as

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.940 
variations that you can possibly do as
far<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.000> your<00:05:02.810> deadlift<00:05:03.260> options<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:03.889> you

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
far as your deadlift options so you

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.770 
far as your deadlift options so you
never<00:05:04.190> have<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.669> do<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.880> same<00:05:05.060> data<00:05:05.300> over<00:05:05.539> and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
never have to do the same data over and

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.110 
never have to do the same data over and
over<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.080> over<00:05:06.110> again<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:07.520> Cory<00:05:07.789> certainly

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
over and over again and Cory certainly

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.790 
over and over again and Cory certainly
doesn't<00:05:08.270> use<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.599> often<00:05:09.020> results<00:05:09.530> because

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
doesn't use that often results because

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.560 
doesn't use that often results because
of<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.010> dead<00:05:10.280> lifting<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> close<00:05:11.210> close<00:05:11.479> to

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
of that dead lifting a close close to

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.839 
of that dead lifting a close close to
600<00:05:12.080> pounds<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.410> yeah<00:05:12.500> by<00:05:12.830> 75<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.550> imagine

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
600 pounds and yeah by 75 it imagine

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.219 
600 pounds and yeah by 75 it imagine
you're<00:05:13.940> chasing<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.300> six<00:05:14.510> huh<00:05:14.660> I'm<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.020> full

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
you're chasing that six huh I'm the full
