the<00:02:41.280> fact<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.520> these<00:02:41.670> are<00:02:41.730> light<00:02:41.970> fast<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the fact that these are light fast and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.160 
the fact that these are light fast and
I'm<00:02:43.530> drawing<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.240> these<00:02:45.240> paper<00:02:45.510> coffee<00:02:45.780> cups

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I'm drawing on these paper coffee cups

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.740 
I'm drawing on these paper coffee cups
which<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.890> hang<00:02:47.130> as<00:02:47.280> installations<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.210> windows

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
which I hang as installations in windows

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.560 
which I hang as installations in windows
some<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.770> have<00:02:49.950> been<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> out<00:02:50.460> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
some of them have been in and out of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.700 
some of them have been in and out of
exhibitions<00:02:51.570> for<00:02:51.930> three<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.230> four<00:02:52.350> years<00:02:52.530> now

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
exhibitions for three or four years now

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.100 
exhibitions for three or four years now
and<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.550> color<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.970> has<00:02:54.240> not<00:02:54.420> faded<00:02:54.660> so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and the color just has not faded so

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.260 
and the color just has not faded so
that's<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.560> fantastic<00:02:56.100> I've<00:02:56.910> embraced

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
that's really fantastic I've embraced

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.600 
that's really fantastic I've embraced
this<00:02:57.510> idea<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.990> upcycling<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:59.280> taking

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
this idea of upcycling I'm taking

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.770 
this idea of upcycling I'm taking
something<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.940> would<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.150> thrown<00:03:00.330> away

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
something that would be thrown away

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.990 
something that would be thrown away
and<00:03:01.140> turning<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.590> into<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.250> valued<00:03:03.000> art<00:03:03.240> object

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
and turning it into a valued art object

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
and turning it into a valued art object
increasingly<00:03:06.000> feel<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.230> our<00:03:07.620> digital

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
increasingly feel that in our digital

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
increasingly feel that in our digital
lives<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.240> face-to-face<00:03:09.540> social

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
lives the face-to-face social

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.520 
lives the face-to-face social
interactions<00:03:11.190> are<00:03:11.460> really<00:03:11.880> precious<00:03:12.530> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
interactions are really precious and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.470 
interactions are really precious and
somehow<00:03:13.830> by<00:03:14.160> recording<00:03:14.730> them<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:15.090> my<00:03:15.270> coffee

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
somehow by recording them on my coffee

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.830 
somehow by recording them on my coffee
cup<00:03:15.830> deepens<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.010> moment<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:18.420> would
