00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello king tungsten first 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.810
 Yaroslavl videobloger decided to sit 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.249
 fry here such mushrooms they 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.409
 called lines at all, either in 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.800
 some countries are considered poisonous 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:34.230
 indeed they contain poison us 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:38.870
 they are conditionally edible to be eaten 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 they first boil in water for 15-20 minutes 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.610
 some even brew them twice I 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 I will also speak this time twice 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.840
 then fire 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.390
 and water should peck before something even 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.270
 I did not think that those mushrooms are so 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.820
 poisonous and that there were even cases of poisoning 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 these mushrooms 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 now took read on the internet 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.800
 but are not poisonous venom there 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 contained which is destroyed during cooking 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.840
 so I will cook them twice 20 times 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.880
 minutes well, or 15 15-20 boil these mushrooms and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:26.060
 fry or taste of course 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 the water is already boiling it is necessary to salt a spoon 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 let yourself boil besides these mushrooms 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 must be washed very thoroughly because 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 that there is sand in them ground garbage 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 all sorts of insects the first time they 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 fell off and drain the water on the date and the second 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.190
 time then still create and you can start 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190
 to fry 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.260
 long course this occupation 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.260
 prepare this dish 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:44.430
 probably another 15 and ready to add onions 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.150
 posadnik bit 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.800
 well let's try 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.130
 mushroom 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:39.180
 salt something is not enough but I am the last 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:46.230
 time all the dishes became a little not 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:49.610
 got any where-shuffling 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.610
 very tasty 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.349
 I always liked 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.800
 divorce from yesterday who no longer became him 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.570
 review do once was review somehow 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.280
 No fireplace considered when we are with the operator 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:24.990
 invested tincture on cedar 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:27.770
 nuts should be so delicious with mushrooms 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.770
 generally wonderful 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.880
