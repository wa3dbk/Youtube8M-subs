00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
took to get here they thought it'd be

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.880 
took to get here they thought it'd be
cool<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> stop<00:02:40.720> along<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.110> way<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.739> road

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890

to<00:02:42.040> SEMA<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.610> get<00:02:43.030> signatures<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> car<00:02:44.019> so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to SEMA and get signatures on the car so

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.380 
to SEMA and get signatures on the car so
that's<00:02:44.470> 2,300<00:02:45.310> miles<00:02:45.459> worth<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.850> signatures

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
that's 2,300 miles worth of signatures
