tomatoes<00:00:22.140> are<00:00:22.380> vines<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.640> they<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.090> very

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
tomatoes are vines and they would very

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
tomatoes are vines and they would very
much<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> take<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.369> space<00:00:26.609> that

much like to take up all your space that
they<00:00:26.970> could<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.460> another<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.760> planting

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they could so another way of planting

do<00:00:36.930> before<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.320> plant<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.700> all

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
do before you plant it is take off all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
do before you plant it is take off all
the<00:00:39.360> bottom<00:00:39.750> leaves<00:00:41.120> more<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.270> half<00:00:43.160> yes

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the bottom leaves more of in half yes

the bottom leaves more of in half yes
that<00:00:44.730> much<00:00:45.440> upside<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.680> containers<00:00:47.750> have<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that much upside down containers have a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
that much upside down containers have a
hole<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> bottom<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.030> widen<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
hole on the bottom you have to widen the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.080 
hole on the bottom you have to widen the
hole<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.340> sometimes<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.670> helps<00:00:53.789> if

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
hole a little bit sometimes it helps if

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
hole a little bit sometimes it helps if
you<00:00:54.270> use<00:00:55.129> scissors<00:00:57.530> yeah<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> tricky

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you use scissors yeah this is the tricky

you use scissors yeah this is the tricky
part<00:01:00.829> hold<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> upside<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.399> take<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> tomato

out of a container and then you have to
somehow<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.659> plant<00:01:10.700> through<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
somehow get this plant through the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
somehow get this plant through the
bottom<00:01:12.930> oh<00:01:14.659> here<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.400> easy

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850

so I need to use this hook I'm going to
hang<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.780> here<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.710> place<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.520> upside-down

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
hang it here and place the upside-down

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.109 
hang it here and place the upside-down
container<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:39.260> high<00:01:40.040> level<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.850> I

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
container on it so it's high level and I

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.290 
container on it so it's high level and I
can<00:01:41.150> see<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.690> I'm<00:01:41.810> doing<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.940> fill<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:46.300> one

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
can see what I'm doing and fill it one

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.200 
can see what I'm doing and fill it one
more<00:01:47.450> time<00:01:47.950> pack<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.100> down<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.700> soil<00:01:50.030> down<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
more time pack it down the soil down a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.450 
more time pack it down the soil down a
little<00:01:50.479> bit<00:01:50.570> more<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.920> put<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.250> little

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
little bit more and just put a little

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.810 
little bit more and just put a little
bit<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.700> gravel<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.240> top<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:55.460> keep<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
bit of gravel on top to keep the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.810 
bit of gravel on top to keep the
moisture<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:58.780> won't<00:01:59.780> dry<00:02:00.080> out<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.500> way<00:02:00.820> in

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
moisture in it won't dry out this way in

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.370 
moisture in it won't dry out this way in
fact<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.210> could<00:02:02.360> probably<00:02:02.390> plants<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.259> little

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
fact you could probably plants a little

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.010 
fact you could probably plants a little
tomato<00:02:03.800> on<00:02:04.070> top<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.550> here<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.479> wanted<00:02:05.810> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
tomato on top of here if you wanted to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.259 
tomato on top of here if you wanted to
or<00:02:06.410> some<00:02:06.680> other<00:02:06.890> plant<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.460> would<00:02:07.610> hang<00:02:08.119> out

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
or some other plant that would hang out

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.020 
or some other plant that would hang out
you<00:02:09.229> make<00:02:09.410> sure<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.679> water<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.550> plant<00:02:10.880> will

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
you make sure you water this plant will

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.699 
you make sure you water this plant will
get<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.330> stressed<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.840> from<00:02:11.900> how<00:02:12.440> hard

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
get a little stressed out from how hard

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.120 
get a little stressed out from how hard
that<00:02:12.920> was<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.400> get<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.880> through<00:02:14.090> there<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:15.100> use<00:02:16.100> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
that was to get it through there I use a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.530 
that was to get it through there I use a
little<00:02:16.489> liquid<00:02:16.940> fertilizer<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> capful

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
little liquid fertilizer about a capful

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.320 
little liquid fertilizer about a capful
per<00:02:21.380> gallon<00:02:22.180> put<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.390> water

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.450 

but<00:02:30.050> before<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.710> too<00:02:30.950> heavy<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.400> water

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
but before I get too heavy with water

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.440 
but before I get too heavy with water
I'm<00:02:32.180> going<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.630> put<00:02:32.780> my<00:02:32.930> pulley<00:02:33.260> system<00:02:33.830> on

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
I'm going to put my pulley system on

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.340 
I'm going to put my pulley system on
this<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.170> great<00:02:36.740> way<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.990> make<00:02:38.990> sure<00:02:39.170> that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
this is a great way to make sure that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.190 
this is a great way to make sure that
you<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.680> lift<00:02:39.950> your<00:02:40.510> tomato<00:02:41.510> plant<00:02:41.870> it's
