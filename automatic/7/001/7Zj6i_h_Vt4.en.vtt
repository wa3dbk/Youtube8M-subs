00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
between photo margarito a rematch would

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
between photo margarito a rematch would
seem<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.729> natural<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> something

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
seem to be natural is that something

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.179 
seem to be natural is that something
that<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.229> guys<00:01:40.409> would<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.710> looking<00:01:40.979> for

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that you guys would be looking for

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.560 
that you guys would be looking for
that's<00:01:41.280> always<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> possibility<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> gotta

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
that's always a possibility but I gotta

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.250 
that's always a possibility but I gotta
see<00:01:44.350> how<00:01:44.740> much<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.310> involved<00:01:46.050> whether<00:01:47.050> the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
see how much is involved whether the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.440 
see how much is involved whether the
fighters<00:01:47.740> will<00:01:47.979> do<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.400> when<00:01:48.700> they'll<00:01:49.000> do<00:01:49.270> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
fighters will do it when they'll do it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.800 
fighters will do it when they'll do it
so<00:01:50.140> all<00:01:50.830> options<00:01:51.460> are<00:01:51.670> open<00:01:51.700> I'm<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:52.600> going

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
so all options are open I'm just going

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.390 
so all options are open I'm just going
to<00:01:52.870> make<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.290> lot<00:01:53.440> easier<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.890> make<00:01:54.130> fights

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
to make it a lot easier to make fights

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.310 
to make it a lot easier to make fights
like<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:54.820> begin<00:01:55.150> super<00:01:55.390> see<00:01:55.630> Missouri<00:01:56.170> or
