00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
previous iterations of the iphone but i

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.560 
previous iterations of the iphone but i
have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> say<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> everything<00:00:57.090> i<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
have to say that everything i have to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.380 
have to say that everything i have to
say<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.010> speculative<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.670> obviously<00:00:59.910> i

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
say is speculative because obviously i

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
say is speculative because obviously i
don't<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:01.020> hands<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.620> iphone<00:01:02.160> 5

otherwise<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.449> would<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> high

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
otherwise this would be in high

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
otherwise this would be in high
definition<00:01:04.790> because<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.180> new<00:01:06.270> iPhones

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
definition because the new iPhones

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740 
definition because the new iPhones
front-facing<00:01:07.439> camera<00:01:07.979> shoots<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.909> 720p

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
75% of us will the front is really hard

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.590 
75% of us will the front is really hard
to<00:01:30.270> replace<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.710> way<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.040> built

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
to replace because the way it's built

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
to replace because the way it's built
its<00:01:33.600> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> building<00:01:34.200> layers<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
its kind of building layers from the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
its kind of building layers from the
rear<00:01:35.610> panel<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.450> through<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
rear panel all the way through to the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
rear panel all the way through to the
front<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.560> order<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> replace<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.820> glass

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
front so in order to replace the glass

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
front so in order to replace the glass
on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> front<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.439> take<00:01:40.890> out

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
on the front you have to take out

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.719 
on the front you have to take out
basically<00:01:42.119> every<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.750> component<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.280> then

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
basically every other component and then

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980 
basically every other component and then
you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> replace<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> front<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> I've<00:01:45.840> had

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
you can replace the front and I've had

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
you can replace the front and I've had
to<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.290> several<00:01:46.530> times<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to do that several times and it the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.469 
to do that several times and it the
quickest<00:01:48.240> i've<00:01:48.509> done<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.100> 45<00:01:50.100> minutes<00:01:50.479> not

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
quickest i've done it is 45 minutes not

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
quickest i've done it is 45 minutes not
only<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.229> part<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> really

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
only that but the part is really

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
only that but the part is really
expensive<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.149> bugs<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
expensive the thing that bugs me the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
expensive the thing that bugs me the
most<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.520> an

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
most about it is that it's not an

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.910 
most about it is that it's not an
in-store<00:01:57.149> repair<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.350> take<00:01:58.619> your

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
in-store repair so if you take your

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.039 
in-store repair so if you take your
iPhone<00:01:59.250> 4<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.520> 4s<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> bus<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> display

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
iPhone 4 or 4s with the bus to display

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
iPhone 4 or 4s with the bus to display
into<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> apple<00:02:01.649> store<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:02.250> can't<00:02:02.460> replace

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
into the apple store they can't replace

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
into the apple store they can't replace
it<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> store<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> takes<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.229> long

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it in the store because it takes so long

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.380 
it in the store because it takes so long
it<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.070> doesn't<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:05.610> sense<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it just doesn't make sense to do it it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.080 
it just doesn't make sense to do it it
would<00:02:06.450> cost<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> lot

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
would cost them a lot

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.940 
would cost them a lot
money<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:08.050> they<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.170> give<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.590> brand<00:02:08.860> new

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
money so they just give you a brand new

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.160 
money so they just give you a brand new
one<00:02:09.239> which<00:02:10.239> for<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> lot<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.629> people<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:11.140> like

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
one which for a lot of people is like

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.920 
one which for a lot of people is like
woohoo<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.890> got<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.069> brand<00:02:12.280> new<00:02:12.340> phone<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.269> from

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
woohoo I got a brand new phone but from

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.690 
woohoo I got a brand new phone but from
a<00:02:13.989> consumption<00:02:14.560> standpoint<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.220> totally

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
a consumption standpoint it's totally

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.729 
a consumption standpoint it's totally
wasteful<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.989> could<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.410> put<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
wasteful because you could just put a

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.130 
wasteful because you could just put a
new<00:02:17.830> part<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.670> would<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.790> fine<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
new part in and it would be fine so the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.640 
new part in and it would be fine so the
iphone<00:02:20.530> 5<00:02:21.390> through<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> pictures<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.410> were

today i can kind of tell though I can't
say<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.269> one<00:02:28.420> hundred<00:02:28.720> percent<00:02:28.750> certainty

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
say with one hundred percent certainty

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.460 
say with one hundred percent certainty
that<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.360> front<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> display<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.440> the

that the the front the display in the

that the the front the display in the
glass<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.610> breeze<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.060> replace

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
glass is going to be a breeze to replace

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.930 
glass is going to be a breeze to replace
it's<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> be<00:02:35.170> very<00:02:35.379> much<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.790> is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's going to be very much like this is

it's going to be very much like this is
my<00:02:37.030> prediction<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:38.170> iphone<00:02:38.500> 3g<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
my prediction the iphone 3g and the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.009 
my prediction the iphone 3g and the
iphone<00:02:39.519> 3gs<00:02:40.060> where<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.660> screws<00:02:40.900> out

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
iphone 3gs where you take the screws out

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.050 
iphone 3gs where you take the screws out
of<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.230> bottom<00:02:41.530> use<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> little<00:02:42.519> suction<00:02:42.730> cup

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
of the bottom use a little suction cup

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.910 
of the bottom use a little suction cup
on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.209> front<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.630> that's<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> sound<00:02:44.799> it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
on the front and that's the sound it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.150 
on the front and that's the sound it
makes<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.959> display<00:02:47.349> comes<00:02:47.590> right<00:02:47.769> off<00:02:47.799> and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
makes the display comes right off and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.589 
makes the display comes right off and
there's<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.640> couple<00:02:48.940> connectors<00:02:49.569> that

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
there's just a couple connectors that

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.900 
there's just a couple connectors that
you<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.049> disconnect<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.700> done

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
you have to disconnect and and it's done

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.710 
you have to disconnect and and it's done
now<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.629> bummer<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:55.030> digitizer<00:02:55.569> is

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
now the bummer is that the digitizer is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
now the bummer is that the digitizer is
still<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.650> looks<00:02:56.799> like<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.160> still<00:02:57.340> fused

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
still it looks like it's still fused

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.960 
still it looks like it's still fused
like<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.060> all<00:02:58.239> one<00:02:58.480> big<00:02:58.510> piece<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.709> um<00:03:00.040> like

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
like it's all one big piece so um like

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.140 
like it's all one big piece so um like
let's<00:03:01.180> say<00:03:01.269> your<00:03:01.480> LCD<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.200> fine<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:03.819> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
let's say your LCD is fine but just the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.819 
let's say your LCD is fine but just the
glass<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.690> broken<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.260> still<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.709> to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
glass is broken you still have to

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.020 
glass is broken you still have to
replace<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.129> whole<00:03:06.370> thing<00:03:06.610> because<00:03:06.879> they're

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
replace the whole thing because they're

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.369 
replace the whole thing because they're
all<00:03:07.150> fused<00:03:07.420> together<00:03:07.540> with<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:07.959> big<00:03:08.200> piece

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
all fused together with one big piece

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.470 
all fused together with one big piece
and<00:03:08.680> that's<00:03:09.549> kind<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.940> bummer<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.299> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
and that's kind of a bummer because it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.660 
and that's kind of a bummer because it
makes<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.780> repair<00:03:11.139> go<00:03:11.829> from<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.340> maybe

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
makes the repair go from like maybe

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.599 
makes the repair go from like maybe
thirty<00:03:13.090> dollars<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.900> probably<00:03:14.260> 150<00:03:14.889> or<00:03:15.069> 200

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
thirty dollars to probably 150 or 200

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.629 
thirty dollars to probably 150 or 200
dollars<00:03:16.319> now<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.380> upside<00:03:17.889> is<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.519> it's

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
dollars now the upside is that if it's

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.059 
dollars now the upside is that if it's
in<00:03:18.819> warranty<00:03:19.359> Apple<00:03:20.019> eats<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.410> cost<00:03:20.650> itself

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
in warranty Apple eats that cost itself

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.830 
in warranty Apple eats that cost itself
like<00:03:21.700> they<00:03:21.819> do<00:03:21.880> through<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.209> pair<00:03:22.389> in<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.599> store

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
like they do through a pair in the store

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.470 
like they do through a pair in the store
and<00:03:23.079> they<00:03:23.859> replace<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.700> front<00:03:24.849> panel<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.420> you

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
and they replace the front panel and you

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.550 
and they replace the front panel and you
don't<00:03:25.630> have<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.840> worry<00:03:25.989> about<00:03:26.139> paying<00:03:26.349> any

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
don't have to worry about paying any

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.069 
don't have to worry about paying any
money<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.299> because<00:03:28.299> they<00:03:28.420> pay<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.810> because

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
money and because they pay it because

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.780 
money and because they pay it because
it's<00:03:29.260> their<00:03:29.380> part<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:29.889> it's<00:03:30.190> out<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.430> warranty

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
panel that i loved from the 3g in the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.000 
panel that i loved from the 3g in the
3gs<00:05:24.950> but<00:05:25.550> no<00:05:26.210> chin<00:05:26.480> see<00:05:26.660> plastic<00:05:26.900> like<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.530> 3g

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
3gs but no chin see plastic like the 3g

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.070 
3gs but no chin see plastic like the 3g
or<00:05:28.160> the<00:05:28.250> 3gs<00:05:28.460> you're<00:05:28.970> getting<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.810> glass

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
or the 3gs you're getting the glass

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.740 
or the 3gs you're getting the glass
you're<00:05:30.650> getting<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.190> aluminum<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:32.030> all<00:05:32.570> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
you're getting the aluminum and all the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.900 
you're getting the aluminum and all the
benefits<00:05:33.140> of<00:05:33.350> both<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:34.010> that's<00:05:34.580> kind<00:05:34.850> of

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
benefits of both so that's kind of

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.700 
benefits of both so that's kind of
exciting<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.390> me<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.660> seems<00:05:36.050> like<00:05:36.230> with<00:05:36.350> every

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
exciting to me it seems like with every

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.110 
exciting to me it seems like with every
iteration<00:05:36.920> they<00:05:37.460> get<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.640> little<00:05:37.820> bit<00:05:38.030> better

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
iteration they get a little bit better

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.110 
iteration they get a little bit better
like<00:05:38.570> each<00:05:39.080> each<00:05:39.980> thing<00:05:40.340> has<00:05:40.490> incorporated<00:05:40.730> a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
like each each thing has incorporated a

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.370 
like each each thing has incorporated a
good<00:05:41.270> thing<00:05:41.510> from<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.900> previous<00:05:42.260> iteration

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
good thing from the previous iteration

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.040 
good thing from the previous iteration
so<00:05:42.980> I'm<00:05:43.430> glad<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.760> see<00:05:43.880> that<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.630> Apple<00:05:44.960> is
