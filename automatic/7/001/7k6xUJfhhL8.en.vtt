00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.049
 give them to on null island today you 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'll tell you how war thunder tanks 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.150
 calculates the distance from the tank to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.179
 targets 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 since there is some physics then 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.010
 the projectile does not fly straight but in an arc means 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 it is subject to the laws of gravity 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.340
 how do we calculate this shot to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.740
 This is to scoff the first thing you need 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.740
 know this need to know what is 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.439
 concept as tank width tank width 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 All tanks of various well, basically it is possible 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.750
 take some pattern for example big 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 tanks like you somewhere about 37 4 meters 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.410
 medium tanks it is somewhere around three 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.270
 meters and lungs it is somewhere 2 and 5 2 and 7 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 that is , we have such numbers for 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.219
 operating up to what we need them 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 just have a formula it divides width 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 tank on the number of marks and multiplied 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.000
 per thousand we get 2 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 Well, the distance is the number of marks 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 For example, here we take the first to intervene with us 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.140
 the first tank takes the length of tank 16 from 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 fur problem is that for the formula 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:21.960
 need a straight head on head on there 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 that is, tank width is tank if 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.270
 multiply by 2 then we get the length of the tank 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.840
 there is on this case, we are straightforwardly sharing 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 on 2 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 if we had, we divide the sides is always 2 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.990
 that is, 16 we get 8 this is a light tank 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.509
 we take it a distance somewhere well yes 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.299
 the width of the tank somewhere 2 and 5 meters divided by 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.950
 8 on our number of strips 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.369
 8 and we get 0 3 0 3 multiply by 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.829
 thousand we get 300 meters three hundred meters 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.530
 this is the first from a little bit below 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.510
 here we direct 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:07.120
 ball tank gone 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.200
 expect the second tank the second tank 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.060
 somewhere takes us 10 answers 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.760
 10 divide 1 is 5 and this tank is okay 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.750
 not 25 meters in my little even more 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:27.160
 it 's somewhere 2 and 7 8 divide by 5 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.380
 we get half a century 530 meters 500 meters 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.920
 this four aiming weave shoots 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.300
 driver is all dead all 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.550
 calculate the distance to yourself 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.720
 the far tank is a heavy tank and stealing 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.440
 so think link order its width 4 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 meter we he holds 8 marks lateral 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:58.210
 this is 458 by 24 we get 4 by 4 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 units this is one kilometer theoretical 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.630
 I think it's so vosmeochka 1 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:13.900
 kilometer this you can Kamensky 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:20.200
 try everything corny just calculated 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:22.840
 hired but you can still make more interesting 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.090
 so as not to divide these all like marks 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.310
 I can just conclude for myself 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.239
 considered putting a heavy tank on you just 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.510
 distinguish there pay 8 means this one 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.000
 one meter of the way one kilometer that is to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.700
 eight if he got 16 you would 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.300
 shot there in four if slightly lower 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.030
 Well then a little less than 2 times is lower 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.540
 that is, in principle, when you start 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.100
 play 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.730
 you are your patterns are drawn to you 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.800
 you will shoot yourself as if understanding 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.560
 principle how to calculate it all 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.650
 plus intuition and announcement will be very 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.470
 quickly turn out like you so 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.930
 thank you all dream was give but they channel well 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.970
 a ln come to our channel 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.440
 subscribe if something is wrong 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.220
 leave comments 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.980
 correct 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.980
 bye bye guys all good game
