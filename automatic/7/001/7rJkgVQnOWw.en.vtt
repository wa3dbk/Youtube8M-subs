what<00:00:55.000> was<00:00:55.120> happening<00:00:55.170> yeah<00:00:56.170> because<00:00:56.739> they're

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
what was happening yeah because they're

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.060

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
speaking very very proper Arabic so we

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.200 
speaking very very proper Arabic so we
don't<00:01:03.219> have<00:01:03.280> an<00:01:03.399> interpreter<00:01:03.910> over<00:01:04.089> here

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
don't have an interpreter over here

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.450 
don't have an interpreter over here
right<00:01:04.330> now<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.920> marine<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.340> we

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
right now and the the marine that we

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.999 
right now and the the marine that we
have<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.789> the<00:01:06.880> platoon<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.360> speaks<00:01:07.600> Arabic

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
have in the platoon that speaks Arabic

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.020 
have in the platoon that speaks Arabic
couldn't<00:01:09.009> understand<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.460> because<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:09.910> too

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
couldn't understand it because it's too

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.419 
couldn't understand it because it's too
proper<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:10.690> as<00:01:11.440> far<00:01:11.649> as<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:11.890> can<00:01:12.009> figure<00:01:12.070> we're

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
proper so as far as we can figure we're

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.249 
proper so as far as we can figure we're
going<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.729> reconnaissance<00:01:13.090> patrol<00:01:13.750> with

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
going on a reconnaissance patrol with

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.780 
going on a reconnaissance patrol with
its<00:01:15.070> one<00:01:15.340> squat<00:01:15.759> Marines<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:17.280> two<00:01:18.280> squads<00:01:18.640> of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
its one squat Marines with two squads of

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.969 
its one squat Marines with two squads of
Jordanians<00:01:19.390> well<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:19.930> about<00:01:20.049> three

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
Jordanians well it's about three

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.120 
Jordanians well it's about three
kilometers<00:01:21.600> away<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.290> we'll<00:01:23.439> go<00:01:23.590> observe<00:01:23.830> an

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
kilometers away and we'll go observe an

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.480 
kilometers away and we'll go observe an
area<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.850> then<00:01:25.270> return<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.960> base<00:01:26.110> after<00:01:26.439> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.710 

because<00:01:33.490> there<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.790> some<00:01:33.939> differences<00:01:34.150> in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
because there are some differences in

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.700 
because there are some differences in
the<00:01:34.840> way<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.860> Jordanians<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:38.259> things<00:01:38.530> have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
the way the Jordanians do things have

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.350 
the way the Jordanians do things have
some<00:01:38.890> different<00:01:39.220> techniques<00:01:39.400> than<00:01:39.850> we<00:01:39.970> do<00:01:40.119> a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
some different techniques than we do a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.819 
some different techniques than we do a
lot<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.200> things<00:01:41.439> are<00:01:41.590> very<00:01:41.619> similar<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:44.020> at<00:01:44.649> the

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
lot of things are very similar so at the

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.630 
lot of things are very similar so at the
end<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.100> patrol<00:01:46.020> we'll<00:01:47.369> compare<00:01:48.369> some

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
end of the patrol we'll compare some

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
end of the patrol we'll compare some
things<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.049> do<00:01:50.170> different<00:01:50.619> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
things that we do different and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.899 
things that we do different and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
everything though we're not going to try

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.839 
everything though we're not going to try
to<00:02:26.560> run<00:02:26.799> their<00:02:26.920> control<00:02:27.280> any<00:02:27.459> certain<00:02:27.819> way

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
to run their control any certain way

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.390 
to run their control any certain way
it's<00:02:28.120> their<00:02:28.329> control<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.500> we'll<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.799> uh

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it's their control so we'll just uh

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400 
it's their control so we'll just uh
we'll<00:02:31.360> play<00:02:31.480> by<00:02:31.690> their<00:02:31.840> rules<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.200> we'll

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.369 
for and hopefully they're receptive to
it<00:02:36.910> they<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.799> out<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.980> Harbor<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:41.140> learned

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
it they have out of Harbor we learned

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.250 
it they have out of Harbor we learned
from<00:02:42.299> from<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.420> different<00:02:43.780> ways<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.930> they

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
from from the different ways that they

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.289 
from from the different ways that they
operate<00:02:44.799> as<00:02:44.980> well<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.400> different<00:02:45.790> techniques

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
operate as well the different techniques

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.729 
operate as well the different techniques
we<00:02:46.480> use<00:02:48.629> some<00:02:49.629> good<00:02:49.810> things<00:02:50.049> some<00:02:50.319> bad<00:02:50.349> things

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
we use some good things some bad things

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.430 
we use some good things some bad things
but<00:02:51.160> even<00:02:51.579> though<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:51.879> not<00:02:52.720> exactly<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.349> way

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
but even though it's not exactly the way

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.589 
but even though it's not exactly the way
we<00:02:53.650> would<00:02:53.709> do<00:02:53.890> something<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.180> still<00:02:55.420> learn

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
we would do something we can still learn

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.839 
we would do something we can still learn
from<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.170> they<00:02:56.950> seem<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.220> they've<00:02:57.609> been

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
from it and they seem like they've been

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.080 
from it and they seem like they've been
receptive<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:59.190> stuff<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> past<00:03:00.609> just<00:03:00.880> by

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
receptive to stuff in the past just by

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.970 
receptive to stuff in the past just by
the<00:03:01.150> way<00:03:01.329> they're<00:03:02.230> trained<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.620> looks<00:03:02.829> like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the way they're trained it looks like

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.309 
the way they're trained it looks like
they've<00:03:03.329> trained<00:03:04.329> with<00:03:04.420> Americans<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.049> for

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
they've trained with Americans and for

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.530 
they've trained with Americans and for
then<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:05.709> know<00:03:05.829> they<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.459> I'm<00:03:07.329> sure

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
then we know they have so I'm sure

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.879 
then we know they have so I'm sure
they'll<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:07.810> receptive<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.620> debrief

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
they'll be receptive to the debrief

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.759 
they'll be receptive to the debrief
point<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.370> we<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.660> then<00:03:13.870> ashesh<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
point that we have and then ashesh and

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.680 
point that we have and then ashesh and
then<00:03:14.919> a<00:03:14.950> shish<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:15.669> although<00:03:15.790> modified<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.419> bit

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
then a shish but although modified a bit

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.159 
then a shish but although modified a bit
I<00:03:16.870> said<00:03:17.139> hey<00:03:17.290> yeah<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.400> just<00:03:19.359> want<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.930> just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
thought it was really good patrol and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.819 
thought it was really good patrol and
it's<00:03:24.639> like<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:26.169> techniques<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.739> you

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
it's like the the techniques that you

it's like the the techniques that you
guys<00:03:27.069> use<00:03:27.310> are<00:03:27.489> very<00:03:27.669> similar<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.120> what<00:03:28.510> we<00:03:28.660> do

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
guys use are very similar to what we do
