00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.860 
the color mix that would reflect the way
the<00:02:17.680> pickguard<00:02:17.890> would<00:02:18.340> look<00:02:18.549> after<00:02:18.870> after

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
the pickguard would look after after

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.170 
the pickguard would look after after
this<00:02:20.200> many<00:02:20.410> years<00:02:20.530> after<00:02:20.980> 75<00:02:21.400> years<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
this many years after 75 years and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.990 
this many years after 75 years and
that's<00:02:22.360> why<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> colors<00:02:23.049> are<00:02:23.260> faded<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
that's why the colors are faded and the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.320 
that's why the colors are faded and the
original<00:02:25.239> colors<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.260> 1938<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.310> 1937<00:02:28.030> were

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
original colors in 1938 in 1937 were

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.690 
original colors in 1938 in 1937 were
much<00:02:28.540> brighter<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.680> replicated<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.280> faded

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
much brighter so we replicated the faded

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.670 
much brighter so we replicated the faded
color<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.180> there's<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:31.780> much<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.500> many

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
memories of how much work we put into

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.229
