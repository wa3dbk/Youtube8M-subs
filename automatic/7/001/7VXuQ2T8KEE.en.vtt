00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.379
 the day I was given the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.480
 challenge I discovered that surviving is one 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.969
 great challenge in a company of a 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.760
 psychopathic planet that spits venom from 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.920
 every media means the desire for hunger 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 money tears us off if you the one with 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.240
 knife from the side of the blade everything 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 free but because the bill comes the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 world a pyramid even if it seems to be the bottom 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 we are controlled by the upper floors 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.619
 illuminated by the high beams 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 everything is held tightly in the chains 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.170
 dog world where evil seems good but 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.689
 always good 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.729
 after where there is no remedy alone 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.119
 sing with your middle finger in the air 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.090
 around lap falls the world falls the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.250
 earth and all in shit 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.049
 I can't believe in a ruled world 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.680
 from the darkness that is difficult to find 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.350
 good with those who do n't smile anymore 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.090
 I can live with those who have always imposed me 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.759
 any limit that is impossible to be if 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.520
 himself without being able to decide black cats 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.560
 folded black pissed-off masses with 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.140
 maces that protest in the squares on 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.280
 black accounts in our businesses that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 we are in the shit 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 it is now obvious it is not difficult to understand 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.039
 what happens 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 few have everything so too many have 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.039
 only ash 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 fuck i feel like last 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.970
 game where the rules are clear and there is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.069
 who has everything who has too 4 other than 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.870
 shit in the neck by the time fire with a 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.060
 so that for fire even that I do not have 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.769
 paid or not they call it world crisis 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.620
 but in the end I realize that in this 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.959
 place really no one does it very chic 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.480
 another saint marzano loses 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.549
 patience and shoot and go on the road 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.530
 how am I going to suck but not to 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.070
 sadness but because of the air that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.070
 Breathe 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.230
 in a world ruled by darkness who 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.550
 it's hard to get along well with those who don't know 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.280
 more smile i can't live holes from 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.840
 always 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.470
 like any limit that is impossible 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.630
 to be himself without being able to decide 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.430
 I can't believe in a ruled world 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.060
 from the darkness that is difficult to find 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.330
 well not everyone is no longer smiling 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.950
 I can live 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.110
 with every limit that it is impossible to be 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.110
 himself without being able to decide
