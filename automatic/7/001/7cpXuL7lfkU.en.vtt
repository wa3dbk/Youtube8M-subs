00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.960
 hardware info tv becomes possible 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.099
 made by ocz 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.099
 msi and hazes 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.510
 in this episode of hart liver tv 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.890
 diana gb 2488 housing 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.890
 because 44 hertz monitor 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.750
 welcome to hardware info tv 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.489
 gaming monitors that work with the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.800
 frequency you higher than 60 hertz we see 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.629
 more and more in a new magazine now 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.190
 number 2 has 2014 in the store 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.690
 an extensive comparison test 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
 And today we are going to talk about one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 of those types of monitors nadia but gb 24 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 8 8 hsu 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 that's 144 ex-model even daniel de 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 heavy parts 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.629
 no, all models are of this 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 moment 144 hertz it is actually 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.540
 mainly marketing because you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.150
 video card must also provide it 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.860
 so this nice that it can but actually 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.239
 has another 20 hertz monitors that 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.500
 we where to turn so you can 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.020
 very happy again with what you say that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 moment you get the 144 if you agree on 144 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 to play you need video card that is too 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 actually can render it in 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 the two in practice is the difference 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.510
 between 120 and 144 did not get very bad 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.130
 big 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.479
 another step back because you can do that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 of course wondering anyway with such 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.720
 light do what is the use of so much 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.400
 images per second because there is often 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.869
 said you are actually over 60 anyway 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.340
 does not see but that is not entirely true 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.659
 have noticed that for you at one 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.549
 test we did with the number 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.740
 the readers panel yes we did when in it 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.320
 120 there 10 guy that you on the site 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.609
 johannes can read back yes a blind man 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 test held where both the 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.630
 testers like the people who actually 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 the monitors did not know with 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.149
 what kind of screen they were working on and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 everyone behind that and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.999
 one hundred and twenty doctors screen to it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.399
 It was obvious that gaming was not obvious 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.810
 that a lot smoother experience 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.670
 especially with fast movements 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.170
 in a 3d world 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.700
 So that's a free now to turn on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.960
 wrps gamers there really is it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.969
 main jacket yellow and you see then 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.079
 it is not quite right finger on 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.460
 to explain my brand to it 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.170
 answer goes smoothly and that's it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 what even better runs on a 60 hertz 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.929
 limited monitor 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.399
 yes it is a clear difference and the 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.659
 joke is that you even put me on the desktop 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.740
 see you just once you are prone to it 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.149
 then you see that you are my cursor 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 for example, flexible moves with it 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.230
 you do not give that 100 euros extra for that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.520
 that actually lost, and then there is a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.230
 point because it's not just that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.610
 type of monitor including which is also yes 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.110
 but more images per second can 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 but the image quality can be adjusted 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
 potential also be slightly better because you 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.600
 don't exaggerate you need that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.069
 is a technology that is slower 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 monitors often apply to ensure the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.850
 picture changes still go faster 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.440
 yes exactly with overdrive becomes a pixel 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.390
 so say about being sent as it were 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 then here becomes completely black or one 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.150
 completely white pushed to which 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.620
 falls back to the color where I need 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.020
 its yes we also see it here on it 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.610
 you see the image on the left 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.560
 an image of our scope as we do 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.060
 with the with the photo riser meter 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.410
 so you see this is the clarity world 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.330
 that should come true just to care 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 that clarity swapping fast 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.270
 death actually scares you over 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.440
 which makes the image clearer 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.630
 becomes if necessary 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 and that delivers nasty art vector yes that sentence 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.670
 year old on the right and crawled out 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.260
 it from a game in the cave that and this 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.510
 is an extreme case but that kind 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.220
 you can see things like that so yes you don't 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.420
 overdrive my slow monitors 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.920
 amerigo sting have the familiar 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.760
 problem that the image stays 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.230
 to hang 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.970
 you do it and it is the extreme then 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.380
 you get this and those quoted are these 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.820
 people move from right to right 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.740
 left through the image showing the image 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.240
 so here from the black of the jacket me 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.350
 the lighter climbed the color of 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.760
 background must go 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.020
 you see so he goes too far making you 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.820
 actually a kind of white border around it 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.530
 gets the very weird looks exactly 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.850
 and the other side of fielders you do that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.140
 don't get on a slow monitor then 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.580
 you again that you change that from the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.690
 pixel that makes you wipe that familiar one 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.550
 effect of 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.870
 especially old lcd monitor and sign in 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.890
 his pocket 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.390
 when the joke is in that we have so 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.680
 also measured for this test is that 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.330
 new screens that are on high 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.370
 frequency that he actually works 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.260
 radio that exaggeration is no longer necessary 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 so also view on the basis of one 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.370
 screenshot of the pixel per ferry riser 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.590
 that bill is running with such a car 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 the very old testament but late 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.980
 nice to see what the difference is between 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.720
 exaggerated not exaggerate yes exactly 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.640
 left you see so another model in 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.470
 yes but that is a lot more affordable 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.700
 there you see the clear yes in this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.800
 case is corpse here 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.020
 because this is what you see on the right 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.700
 the GB 2488 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.530
 well then you can actually see the image 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.070
 perfectly stable so that's who it is 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.420
 want to have 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.500
 this car will therefore continue very quickly 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.030
 image in it finds here at the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.920
 left engine so what after very easy ' 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.000
 just gets the previous image out of the oven 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.320
 then at this where it is just as hard 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.980
 it actually runs through the flour 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.010
 perfectly stable 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.299
 yes you also have 120 doctor models that anyway 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.940
 be able to apply transfer but yes there 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.960
 here again often that artifact 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.669
 naturally we also measure a lower one 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.350
 response time but actually you have it 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.790
 not 3.8 that much else 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.620
 milliseconds at one of speaking that is 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.910
 pretty meaningless yes that is that has other 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.560
 to do marketing with those numbers 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.030
 from manufacturers who like two 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.900
 milliseconds or in July seconds on the 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.340
 want to put a box 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.690
 yes why actually know in practice 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.490
 If we know that I know you 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.870
 never comes and that it 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.120
 art and flying what it takes 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.950
 to really search eyes and investigate 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.480
 to come during low times 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.070
 good claims that in practice so 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.810
 more bad blood often than it really is 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.670
 that yields yes exactly 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.710
 as long as it's under the mine 8.3 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.270
 milliseconds stays for another 20 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.620
 art screen is just fine with a 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.450
 quite a number of these types of monitors 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.980
 in the magazine that is currently in store 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.140
 how do you speak your specific diamond 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.760
 is a nice door with many functions 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.080
 you can a you can the pivo teri you can 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.400
 change it in height 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.020
 So he has that through you as 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.640
 displayport so you can also use it 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.140
 multiple ways with that high refresh 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.430
 rate because it is also bad 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.810
 important to say i think via hdmi 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.390
 that is not possible at the moment 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.920
 that's right because the bandwidth is too limited 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.090
 in theory it would also be possible we could 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.200
 well that more point four but in the 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.360
 we see that in practice on this kind 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.710
 monitor is a scalar that adam ii one 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.420
 points that has combined with this 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.980
 ideas and display port perhaps in the 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.450
 future as hdmi 2 panel again 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.280
 monitors and PCs still it that is cell 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.600
 expired but not on the agenda 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.070
 and yes but also like my old one 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.560
 of the of the of the good points of 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.520
 that engine is that the price is relative 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.900
 limited because you always pay real 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.280
 an additional price for being 104 a woman 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.540
 gert screen I just had it on 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.070
 you have to count on something from 100 euros 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.780
 extra but we still see this 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.370
 however, monitors often well above 300 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.600
 euro costs well there are a few 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.190
 models that are just below that 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.900
 this yes but you really are brand new 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.440
 newest technologies also in and he 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.550
 still short average of 285 290 euros 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.900
 that's a very good price 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.980
 actually come 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.750
 certainly for the performance we have 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.190
 measured where should we will the specific 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.320
 saying that these are monitors 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.550

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.010
 intended for people who are first person 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.600
