miniature a leg hole leg would be
tangled<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:57.730> heina

if<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.040> have<00:01:00.280> these<00:01:00.520> hang-ups<00:01:00.910> at<00:01:01.149> home<00:01:01.360> I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
if you have these hang-ups at home I

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.049 
if you have these hang-ups at home I
would<00:01:02.290> recycle<00:01:02.649> they're<00:01:03.520> extremely

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
would recycle they're extremely

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.780 
would recycle they're extremely
dangerous<00:01:04.320> unless<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.740> could<00:01:05.890> sew<00:01:06.579> them

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
dangerous unless you could sew them

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.239 
dangerous unless you could sew them
across<00:01:07.090> somehow<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.290> make<00:01:08.469> the<00:01:08.619> hole<00:01:08.829> smaller

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
across somehow and make the hole smaller

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.789 
across somehow and make the hole smaller
but<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.149> don't<00:01:10.479> think<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:10.929> would<00:01:11.079> be<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.469> very

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
but I don't think that would be a very

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.899 
but I don't think that would be a very
good<00:01:12.069> safety<00:01:12.340> issue

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
good safety issue

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.910 
good safety issue
it's<00:01:13.509> they<00:01:14.109> are<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.289> big<00:01:14.530> safety<00:01:14.799> issue<00:01:16.679> so<00:01:17.679> this

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
it's they are a big safety issue so this

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.010 
it's they are a big safety issue so this

and as you can see here these holes are

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.910 
and as you can see here these holes are
definitely<00:01:44.149> easy<00:01:44.659> enough<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.469> get<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> whole

tangled<00:01:50.659> up<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.700> also<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:52.909> have<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.450> loop

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
tangled up in this also we have a loop

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.789 
tangled up in this also we have a loop
damned<00:01:53.990> again<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.679> very<00:01:55.070> fine<00:01:56.259> cord<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:58.390> Holly

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.740 
damned again a very fine cord of Holly
which<00:02:00.799> would<00:02:01.069> be<00:02:01.220> quite<00:02:01.429> dangerous<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:02.689> we

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
which would be quite dangerous if we

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.440 
which would be quite dangerous if we
seen<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.500> wrapped<00:02:04.340> around<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.850> horse's<00:02:05.210> leg

as<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.869> know<00:02:06.079> horses<00:02:06.939> will<00:02:07.939> struggle<00:02:08.300> when

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
as we know horses will struggle when

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.660 
as we know horses will struggle when
they<00:02:09.009> become<00:02:10.009> entangled<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.209> link<00:02:12.670> this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.809 
bottom a metal ring but most of the hay
of<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:21.110> would<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.470> placed<00:02:22.099> in<00:02:22.310> these<00:02:22.549> two

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
of that would be placed in these two

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.009 
of that would be placed in these two
heinous<00:02:23.390> would<00:02:24.170> fall<00:02:24.440> up<00:02:24.730> they're<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.019> not

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
heinous would fall up they're really not

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.460 
heinous would fall up they're really not
they<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:27.590> work<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.190> any<00:02:28.459> purpose<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.470> -

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
they don't work for any purpose at all -

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.620 
they don't work for any purpose at all -
maybe<00:02:31.190> contain<00:02:31.670> balls<00:02:31.940> would<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.269> a<00:02:32.390> better

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
maybe contain balls would be a better
