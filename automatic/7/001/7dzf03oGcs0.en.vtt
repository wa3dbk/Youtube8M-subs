00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.190 

this<00:00:31.580> is<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.850> stack<00:00:32.150> series<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.840> our<00:00:32.960> power

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
this is the stack series of our power

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.410 
this is the stack series of our power
banks<00:00:33.560> these<00:00:34.400> have<00:00:34.790> some<00:00:34.970> very<00:00:35.150> unique

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
banks these have some very unique

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420 
banks these have some very unique
features<00:00:36.200> compared<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.680> other<00:00:36.800> power<00:00:37.100> banks

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
features compared to other power banks

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.010 
features compared to other power banks
the<00:00:37.970> first<00:00:38.180> thing<00:00:38.360> they<00:00:38.480> have<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.750> they<00:00:38.870> have

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
the first thing they have is they have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.670 
the first thing they have is they have
entered<00:00:39.350> outputs<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.550> USB<00:00:41.000> micro<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.410> a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
entered outputs the USB micro and a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.400 
entered outputs the USB micro and a
lightning<00:00:43.130> as<00:00:44.000> well<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.690> standard<00:00:45.260> USB

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
lightning as well as a standard USB

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.670 
lightning as well as a standard USB
output<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:46.970> input<00:00:47.410> but<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.530> really

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
output this is the input but the really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.500 
output this is the input but the really
unique<00:00:48.920> feature<00:00:49.370> about<00:00:49.520> these<00:00:49.910> is<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.239> they

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
unique feature about these is that they

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.780 
unique feature about these is that they
can<00:00:50.690> stack<00:00:51.019> in<00:00:51.230> charge<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.309> stack<00:00:52.610> and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
can stack in charge and stack and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.500 
can stack in charge and stack and
discharge

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
discharge

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
discharge
here<00:00:55.109> are<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.589> these<00:00:55.679> stacks<00:00:56.070> series<00:00:56.489> guys

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
here are two of these stacks series guys

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.939 
here are two of these stacks series guys
nested<00:00:57.600> together<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.019> have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> stack<00:00:58.410> 9<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
nested together we have a stack 9 on the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
nested together we have a stack 9 on the
bottom<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.850> stack<00:01:00.120> six<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.750> top<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
bottom the stack six here on top of you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
bottom the stack six here on top of you
can<00:01:01.409> stack<00:01:01.920> them<00:01:02.129> however<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.909> choose<00:01:03.149> oh

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
can stack them however you so choose oh

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810 
can stack them however you so choose oh
they're<00:01:03.719> magnetized<00:01:04.110> they're<00:01:04.530> magnetized<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
they're magnetized they're magnetized to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
they're magnetized they're magnetized to
stay<00:01:06.360> together<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.340> pogo

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
stay together and they have these pogo

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.160 
stay together and they have these pogo
pins<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.299> make<00:01:09.450> contact<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:10.140> another

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pins here to make contact one another

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.350 
pins here to make contact one another
and<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.680> enables<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.430> key<00:01:11.729> features<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
and that enables two key features that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
and that enables two key features that
are<00:01:12.479> differentiating<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.259> product<00:01:13.680> first

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
are differentiating this product first

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.389 
are differentiating this product first
is<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.909> base<00:01:15.090> stack<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> charge<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.710> i<00:01:16.830> hook

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
is the base stack in charge so if i hook

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.370 
is the base stack in charge so if i hook
an<00:01:17.580> input<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.420> both<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.289> these

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
an input into here both of these

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
an input into here both of these
batteries<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.039> charts<00:01:20.369> together<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.869> i

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
batteries will charts together so if i

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
batteries will charts together so if i
put<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.440> on<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.649> kitchen<00:01:23.009> counter<00:01:23.190> hook

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
put these on my kitchen counter hook

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.389 
put these on my kitchen counter hook
hook<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.649> all<00:01:25.830> charged<00:01:26.250> up

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
hook up just one they all charged up

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.740 
hook up just one they all charged up
together<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.149> they're<00:01:27.300> ready<00:01:27.420> all

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
together and then they're ready all

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
together and then they're ready all
together<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.289> next<00:01:28.409> day<00:01:28.679> but<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.550> really

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
together the next day but the really

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.430 
together the next day but the really
unique<00:01:29.970> feature<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.509> its<00:01:30.960> stack<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
unique feature is its stack and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.399 
unique feature is its stack and
discharge<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.789> hook<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.390> load<00:01:33.990> into

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
discharge so if i hook it a load into

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.559 
discharge so if i hook it a load into
this<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.860> output<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.729> i'm<00:01:35.850> charging<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
this into this output say i'm charging a

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.039 
this into this output say i'm charging a
laptop<00:01:37.289> or<00:01:37.530> charging<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> tablet<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.899> will

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
laptop or charging a tablet they will

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.010 
laptop or charging a tablet they will
discharge<00:01:40.740> top<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.610> bottom<00:01:41.909> which<00:01:42.509> means<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
discharge top to bottom which means this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
discharge top to bottom which means this
guy<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.319> discharged<00:01:43.740> first<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
guy have discharged first then this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.570 
guy have discharged first then this
guy's<00:01:44.940> discharged<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.080> if<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.530> need<00:01:46.770> two<00:01:47.280> amps

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
guy's discharged so if i need two amps

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.490 
guy's discharged so if i need two amps
out<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.819> there<00:01:47.940> for<00:01:48.119> six<00:01:48.330> hours<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.259> stack

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
out of there for six hours I just stack

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.410 
out of there for six hours I just stack
these<00:01:49.679> up<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:50.069> much<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.280> many<00:01:50.580> as<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> need<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
these up as much as many as I need and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380 
these up as much as many as I need and
they<00:01:51.750> discharge<00:01:52.310> continuously<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
they discharge continuously that is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
they discharge continuously that is
awesome<00:01:54.720> I've<00:01:55.679> never<00:01:55.890> seen<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.280> before<00:01:56.429> no

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
awesome I've never seen that before no

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.290 
awesome I've never seen that before no
one<00:01:57.240> has<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> while<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:59.000> probably<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> stupid

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
one has a while so I probably a stupid

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.389 
one has a while so I probably a stupid
question<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.050> of<00:02:01.470> these<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.160> stacked

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
question but all of these can be stacked

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.219 
question but all of these can be stacked
together<00:02:02.610> history<00:02:03.179> can<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.629> just<00:02:03.899> history

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
together history can be so just history

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.770 
together history can be so just history
I'll<00:02:04.470> go<00:02:04.649> snack<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.129> charge<00:02:05.340> packages<00:02:05.910> can<00:02:06.660> be

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I'll go snack in charge packages can be

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.969 
I'll go snack in charge packages can be
stacked<00:02:06.989> together<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.590> stack<00:02:07.830> in

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
stacked together and they stack in

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.589 
stacked together and they stack in
charge<00:02:08.160> only<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.729> don't<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> discharge

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
charge only they don't do the discharge

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.600 
charge only they don't do the discharge
