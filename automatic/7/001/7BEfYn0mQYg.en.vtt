00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 I recover want to be luggage 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.720
 in the different hotels 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 cottages or bed and breakfasts that are 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.340
 located on the stevenson handles and and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.629
 Saint Jacques de Compostela and I 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 bring in the morning the place where 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.059
 to sleep people so voila when I 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 created the manne postel in March 2009 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 the beautiful days we managed to make 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.660
 finally I can do 60 70 pieces of luggage 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.729
 day last year on my august joint 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.470
 and September 2012 we made the big ones 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.280
 420 baggage days a day so we have 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.509
 we evolved well at the beginning it was the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.960
 Postal trunk vehicle today 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.909
 This is 8 almost nine and that's 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.170
 20 employees so we do not only 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.340
 luggage transport but also 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.120
 transport of people ie 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.560
 we bring back the 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.170
 hikers when they finished their 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 their journey which can last a week 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 or a fortnight we bring them back to their 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 starting point so we installed a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 shuttle system for example on the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.120
 Saint Jacques de Compostela at the start 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.910
 conch every day in part to 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.170
 13:30 and we go back through the different 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.390
 villages crossed by St. Jacques 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 so to know espalion nasbinals 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.180
 aumont-aubrac saugues 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 we come back to the pub for 17 hours 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 so that people can resume the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.320
 train 17.30 months on the year 2012 that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.420
 I set up it's for example everything 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 beast to an open telephone bass of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.410
 7:30 am to 8 pm every day during the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 season alas as soon as people call 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.350
 as soon as customers hikers 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.679
 call finally they are told off the mark 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.060
 tock 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.710
 we are able to find them a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 solution to tac and that's what 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.500
 do a little bit our reputation 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.030
 after I spoke earlier of his 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 shuttles that are at their fixed and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.170
 regularly we secure a lot 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.610
 hikers so suddenly again 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.950
 that's what makes our reputation 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.110
 and then finally to finish it's true that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 the mailbag would be nothing without its 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 in the team around me what then 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.300
 certainly in the office we are three 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 works a lot especially during 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.280
 the season but we must not forget the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.200
 drivers who are on the ground and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.050
 it's true that there we shoot with a 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.730
 fifteen drivers 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.800
 each driver 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.769
 carries 70-80 luggage during the 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.830
 day is beating 450 kilometers in the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.150
 good day ben here it is necessary 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.650
 and it's thanks to them who are on the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.550
 field as well as it goes well 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 quite simply 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.970
 but it does not go without the other is to 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.130
 say without the work we do at 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.069
 office they would not work in 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.900
 good conditions on the ground and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.489
 we could not have today a 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.420

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.560
