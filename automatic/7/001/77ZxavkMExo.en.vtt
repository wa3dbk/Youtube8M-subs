00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
really make the most of my new energy

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
really make the most of my new energy
levels<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> should<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:31.890> advantage<00:01:31.980> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
levels but I should take advantage of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.790 
levels but I should take advantage of
that<00:01:32.490> hopefully<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> future<00:01:34.530> once

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800
