00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.669 

be<00:01:32.390> sure<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:32.570> probably<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:33.049> asked<00:01:33.229> him<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:33.590> hope

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
we can have a video yeah well the thing

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.899 
we can have a video yeah well the thing
is<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:35.869> please<00:01:36.170> -<00:01:36.920> games<00:01:37.249> are<00:01:37.429> always<00:01:37.700> going

is like please - games are always going
so<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.899> seems<00:01:39.140> believable<00:01:39.380> at<00:01:39.740> first<00:01:40.039> but

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
so that seems believable at first but

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.550 
so that seems believable at first but
what<00:01:41.359> wouldn't<00:01:41.780> need<00:01:41.960> me<00:01:42.049> come<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.350> more

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
what wouldn't need me come in more

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.050 
what wouldn't need me come in more
concerned<00:01:43.100> about<00:01:43.310> seeing<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.700> thing<00:01:43.880> than

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
concerned about seeing that thing than

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.459 
concerned about seeing that thing than
the<00:01:44.359> word<00:01:44.509> if<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.719> camera<00:01:45.020> was<00:01:45.170> on

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
the word if the camera was on

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.199 
the word if the camera was on
mm-hmm<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:46.069> guess<00:01:46.399> they<00:01:46.490> don't<00:01:46.549> boots<00:01:46.789> officer

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
mm-hmm I guess they don't boots officer

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.309 
mm-hmm I guess they don't boots officer
so<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.509> video<00:01:47.749> more<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> cooler
