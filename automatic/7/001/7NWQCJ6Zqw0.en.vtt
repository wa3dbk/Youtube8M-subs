story he was telling it's really

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.189 
story he was telling it's really
annoying<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:56.329> like<00:00:57.329> basically<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.840> said

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
annoying because like basically I said

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.119 
annoying because like basically I said
before<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:59.070> stormtroopers<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.090> picked

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
before with stormtroopers we picked

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
before with stormtroopers we picked
quantity<00:01:02.129> over<00:01:02.370> quality<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.350> we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
quantity over quality so you know we

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.789 
quantity over quality so you know we
have<00:01:04.650> say<00:01:04.979> 10<00:01:05.640> million<00:01:06.200> average<00:01:07.200> Lee<00:01:07.470> trained

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
have say 10 million average Lee trained

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.670 
have say 10 million average Lee trained
soldiers<00:01:08.520> vs<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.180> don't<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.390> 10,000<00:01:10.110> good

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
soldiers vs I don't know 10,000 good

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.660 
soldiers vs I don't know 10,000 good
ones<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:13.200> works<00:01:13.380> sometimes<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.580> know

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
ones and that works sometimes you know

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.679 
ones and that works sometimes you know
because<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> field<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> find

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because if you have a field and you find

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
because if you have a field and you find
one<00:01:18.900> gun<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> matters<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.340> there's<00:01:20.549> one

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
one gun into it a matters if there's one

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.340 
one gun into it a matters if there's one
target<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> middle<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> feels<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.990> Joe

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
target in the middle it feels like Joe

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
target in the middle it feels like Joe
Patrol<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:23.909> 10,000<00:01:24.450> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Patrol but if you have like 10,000 or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.560 
Patrol but if you have like 10,000 or
100,000<00:01:25.020> soldiers<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.979> like

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
100,000 soldiers right here it's like

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
100,000 soldiers right here it's like
boom<00:01:27.570> bah<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> isn't<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.890> matter

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
boom bah and it isn't really matter

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.440 
boom bah and it isn't really matter
because<00:01:29.280> eventually<00:01:29.820> someone's<00:01:30.210> gonna<00:01:30.270> hit

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
because eventually someone's gonna hit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
because eventually someone's gonna hit
it<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> math<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it that's just math you know it's just

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.609 
it that's just math you know it's just
statistics<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.270> sometimes<00:01:33.900> despite<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
statistics but sometimes despite that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
statistics but sometimes despite that
they<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:35.909> seem<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> hit<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they don't they don't seem to hit the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
they don't they don't seem to hit the
mark<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.729> with

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
mark and it really has more to do with

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
mark and it really has more to do with
who<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.329> shooting<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.290> anything

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
who they're shooting at than anything

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
who they're shooting at than anything
else<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.369> people<00:01:41.970> you've<00:01:42.180> never<00:01:42.329> heard<00:01:42.509> of
