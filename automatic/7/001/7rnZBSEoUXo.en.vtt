00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 play that leaves nothing to be desired 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 that the entire terrain of the red bull 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.740

 be close to the public 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.030
 which makes the histo cup so unique 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.950
 this closeness to the public is apparent 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.870
 everything in the open atmosphere of the free 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 accessible driver's camp where pilots 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 mechanics and accompanying staff like 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.850
 to ask questions about your racing car 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.059
 that especially many bmw 325 liters 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.070
 series e30 until 1991 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.020
 are quick to notice and are so 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.480
 wanted there in the context of the histo cup the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.809
 biggest european market cup called 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.610
 bmw 325 challenge is doing so is the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.020
 motto equals and immediately joins 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.850
 happiest to one 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.200
 spirited fight on the new 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.150
 Formula 1 stretch 42 hot bmw bolides 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.100
 the one close to production 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.960
 technical regulations and lie that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.150
 among other things also unit tire of the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 Manufacturer toyo tires demands 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.110
 in two races with an enthusiastic one 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.270
 Audience over and deliver themselves snappy 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.399
 two and more fights and neither will 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290
 favorable moments still favorable places 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.660
 left out to the contractor that 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.950
 to make life difficult 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.899
 Dietmar Lackinger 6 times master 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.910
 this class already dominates in the 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.860
 But training is in the qualifying of 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.049
 luca rescue brook at 0 9 seconds 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.890
 beaten in the first race in the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.380
 seventh round, however, fails faymann 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.510
 the able one therefore l'aquila himself 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 georg steffny from salzburg michael 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 winkler and max stubbornly persist 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.020
 the heels are the high tempo 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 that the top group is free 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.070
 to call may currently makes distance from 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.869
 about eleven seconds to the chase field 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.200
 led by karl heinz humberg 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.939
 clear 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 this world can be in this order 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.520
 the first of two races for themselves 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 decide 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.870
 This is how Lackinger fulfills a dream 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.769
 for his fortieth birthday namely 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.150
 to win wrestling on this route 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.040
 lengers luck turns in the second 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 running in the opposite direction in the narrow 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.420
 starterfeld sets lackinger on clear 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.670
 But line management will be done by teammates 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:33.709
 jan kasperle and caught the happy 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.840
 first try only grass to the previous year 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.090
 Although lowered by board videos form 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.670
 teammates of jankas polycom one 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.900
 So I got the steering wheel straight 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.819
 Three years later you get one 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.110
 and is in me 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.040
 some forums and company the guardrails 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.870
 follow and was not just more 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.750
 I'm actually more passengers 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.950
 or less to come to hand 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.049
 Green problem is two weeks 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.430
 we do not know how to do it when you are 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.810
 do not drive the race then it looks 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.019
 course bad for the championship 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.019
 out 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.970
 Michael Winkler at the end of the second 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.980
 Run an honorable sixth place 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.870
 can record for himself watching the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.329
 accident at close range 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.660
 It was still like that after the startup phase 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.670
 it is relatively tight on the right side 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.560
 the years before the mr. Kasper drove 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.010
 lies on the sides of the dietmar 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.620
 lackinger and in which jan type the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.850
 I did not think I was playing 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.400
 exactly in the middle 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.109
 and then were far more closely 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.739
 has never been touched and then she in shape 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:37.010
 in front of me with advice and then has in 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.790
 So South Africa shot so out of mine 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 clear view of water in and for one 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.840
 safety-car-phase the three rounds lasts 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.880
 does not bring everyone out of the rhythm 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.349
 christian walleit does not let out 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.060
 the version lurking his lurking 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.920
 foremen from well calculated 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.569
 distance up and grabs the victory 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.560
 despite sensible pressure by sap 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.970
 under holzer very good it was to 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.340
 It was then the safety car phase 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.370
 through the serious accident 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.810
 and luckily I have mine 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 they demand really nice 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.030
 can wait until the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.439
 safety-car drive away leave and 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.329
 also could be a bit earlier gas 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.980
 and have thus largely surplus 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.540
 children 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.030
 After that, of course, it was not quite 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.310
 easy because that's very entertaining gucci 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.870
 depressed and I really give gas 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.120
 but have to mature properly 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.500
 actually the car drove too hot 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.199
 has slipped and I'm really 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.150
 glad that he was placed in the 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.910
 am the first place to the finish 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.800
 that was the start of the bmw challenge 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.560
 the participant-strongest class of the histo 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.050
 cup the today on 27 and 28 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.760
 september the season finale also on 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.760
 the red bull ring will rise
