me<00:02:54.420> guys<00:02:54.569> if<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> use<00:02:55.170> them<00:02:55.349> then<00:02:55.500> there's<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
me guys if you use them then there's a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
me guys if you use them then there's a
big<00:02:56.220> chance<00:02:56.400> they<00:02:56.609> can<00:02:56.670> get<00:02:56.879> banned<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
big chance they can get banned and

there's no point risking that bind

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.800 
there's no point risking that bind
because<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.489> could<00:02:59.640> be<00:02:59.760> permanent<00:03:00.299> now

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
