modern<00:00:26.100> what<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:26.550> gonna<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.270> I'm<00:00:27.480> gonna

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
modern what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.250 
modern what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
start<00:00:27.960> off<00:00:28.200> by<00:00:28.500> taking<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.580> front<00:00:29.880> section

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
start off by taking this front section

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.410 
start off by taking this front section
so<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.530> do<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> literally<00:00:33.030> place

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so what you do is you literally place

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.590 
so what you do is you literally place
the<00:00:33.690> roller<00:00:34.579> about<00:00:35.579> three<00:00:35.910> inches<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the roller about three inches from the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.560 
the roller about three inches from the
end<00:00:36.749> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.589> wrap<00:00:38.339> the<00:00:39.329> hair<00:00:39.539> around

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
end and then just wrap the hair around

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.619 
end and then just wrap the hair around
with<00:00:40.499> your<00:00:40.980> fingers<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:42.120> wrapping<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
with your fingers so you're wrapping it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.860 
with your fingers so you're wrapping it
into<00:00:42.839> position<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.589> it's<00:00:44.190> much<00:00:44.550> easier<00:00:45.269> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
into position and it's much easier to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.130 
into position and it's much easier to
place<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.589> roller<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.159> when<00:00:47.909> you<00:00:48.059> wrap<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.359> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
place the roller in when you wrap it so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.509 
place the roller in when you wrap it so
this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.379> giving<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.679> lots<00:00:49.859> of<00:00:50.039> volume<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.429> the

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
this is giving you lots of volume on the

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.000 
this is giving you lots of volume on the
ends<00:00:50.819> but<00:00:50.999> not<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.539> much<00:00:51.749> on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> root<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
ends but not so much on the root and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
ends but not so much on the root and
that's<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> key<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.239> front<00:00:54.569> of<00:00:54.719> your

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.080 
because of that you've got lots and lots
of<00:02:09.050> root<00:02:09.260> lift<00:02:09.530> that's<00:02:10.399> brilliant<00:02:10.730> books

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
of root lift that's brilliant books

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.700 
of root lift that's brilliant books
before<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.570> could<00:02:11.930> only<00:02:12.080> ever<00:02:12.260> get<00:02:12.410> them<00:02:12.560> like

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
before I could only ever get them like

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.370 
before I could only ever get them like
these<00:02:12.920> because<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.940> try<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.300> do<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.870> place

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
these because I try and do them in place

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.290 
these because I try and do them in place
and<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.830> would<00:02:15.950> all<00:02:16.070> kind<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.820> spill<00:02:17.150> out

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and then it would all kind of spill out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.990 
and then it would all kind of spill out
yes<00:02:18.200> you're<00:02:18.410> doing<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:18.740> well<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.370> what

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
yes you're doing really well so what

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
we're gonna do is continue that and just

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.120 
we're gonna do is continue that and just
work<00:02:23.120> our<00:02:23.750> way<00:02:23.900> down<00:02:23.930> towards<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> end<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
work our way down towards the end of the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.890 
work our way down towards the end of the
hair<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.670> once<00:02:25.850> we've<00:02:26.030> done<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.600> most

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
hair and once we've done that the most

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.420 
hair and once we've done that the most
important<00:02:27.470> thing<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.250> to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
important thing that you have to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.360 
important thing that you have to
remember<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.290> leave<00:02:30.290> them<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.739> cool<00:02:30.890> down

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
remember is to leave them to cool down

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.900 
remember is to leave them to cool down
the<00:02:31.790> cooling<00:02:32.750> action<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.370> heat<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.580> roller

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
the cooling action of the heat of roller

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.479 
the cooling action of the heat of roller
is<00:02:35.510> what<00:02:35.810> sets<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> into<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.160> lovely

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
is what sets it into that lovely

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.850 
is what sets it into that lovely
volumous<00:02:38.330> curl<00:02:38.570> yeah<00:02:38.930> how<00:02:39.380> long<00:02:39.560> will<00:02:39.650> really

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
volumous curl yeah how long will really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.260 
volumous curl yeah how long will really
do<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.100> take<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.430> cool<00:02:40.580> down<00:02:40.790> we're<00:02:40.970> talking

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
do they take to cool down we're talking

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.380 
do they take to cool down we're talking
it's<00:02:41.450> not<00:02:41.480> ours<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.350> no<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.190> isn't<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.209> best

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
it's not ours is it no it isn't the best

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's not ours is it no it isn't the best
way<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.540> just<00:02:44.810> test<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:45.380> by<00:02:45.500> holding<00:02:45.680> it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
way you just test it just by holding it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.160 
way you just test it just by holding it
and<00:02:46.160> touching<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.610> okay<00:02:47.510> I'm<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.750> gonna<00:02:47.840> use

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
and touching it okay I'm just gonna use

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.140 
and touching it okay I'm just gonna use
a<00:02:48.200> pin<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.100> very<00:02:49.400> simple<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.030> most

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
a pin here very simple the most

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.120 
a pin here very simple the most
important<00:02:50.690> thing<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.050> get<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.620> right

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
important thing is to get it right

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.120 
important thing is to get it right
underneath<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.050> straight<00:02:54.050> through<00:02:54.470> don't

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
underneath and straight through don't

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.470 
underneath and straight through don't
put<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.209> very<00:02:56.780> end

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.230 

so<00:03:00.020> that's<00:03:00.200> all<00:03:00.410> other<00:03:00.980> always<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:02.030> see

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
so that's all other always in you see

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.940 
so that's all other always in you see
what<00:03:02.360> we've<00:03:02.480> done<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.080> go<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.709> bigger

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
what we've done is to go for the bigger

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860 
what we've done is to go for the bigger
ones<00:03:04.069> at<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.610> top<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.120> slightly<00:03:05.599> smaller

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
ones at the top and slightly smaller

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.570 
ones at the top and slightly smaller
ones<00:03:06.050> on<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.349> underneath<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.370> just

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
ones on the underneath and that just

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580 
ones on the underneath and that just
gives<00:03:07.760> extra<00:03:08.239> volume<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> on<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.230> underneath

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
gives extra volume on on the underneath

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.949 
gives extra volume on on the underneath
of<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.800> hair<00:03:10.040> quick<00:03:10.550> hairspray<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.870> way

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
of the hair quick hairspray all the way

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.350 
of the hair quick hairspray all the way
through<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.190> these<00:03:13.340> ones<00:03:13.640> here<00:03:14.060> at<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
through so these ones here at the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.059 
through so these ones here at the
Front's<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:14.989> started<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.410> cool<00:03:15.590> down<00:03:15.800> so

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
Front's have started to cool down so

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.500 
Front's have started to cool down so
what<00:03:16.190> we're<00:03:16.310> going<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.459> do<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.850> really<00:03:17.180> just

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
what we're going to do is really just

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.540 
what we're going to do is really just
allow<00:03:18.319> all<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.620> them<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.950> cool<00:03:19.100> down<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.400> takes

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
allow all of them to cool down it takes

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.070 
allow all of them to cool down it takes
about<00:03:19.700> 10<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.000> 15<00:03:20.420> minutes<00:03:20.690> before<00:03:20.810> we<00:03:20.989> start

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
about 10 to 15 minutes before we start

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.080 
about 10 to 15 minutes before we start
taking<00:03:21.440> them<00:03:21.680> out<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.400> can<00:03:22.580> make<00:03:22.760> sure<00:03:22.790> we

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
taking them out so we can make sure we

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.840 
taking them out so we can make sure we
get<00:03:23.239> maximum<00:03:24.200> volume<00:03:24.560> from<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.860> heat<00:03:25.010> okay<00:03:25.790> so

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
get maximum volume from the heat okay so

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.699 
get maximum volume from the heat okay so
they're<00:03:26.120> cooled<00:03:26.360> down<00:03:26.540> really<00:03:26.840> well<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.470> what

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
they're cooled down really well so what

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.100 
they're cooled down really well so what
we<00:03:27.830> need<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.010> do<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.489> take<00:03:28.730> these<00:03:29.060> out<00:03:29.300> and

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
little bit of backcombing at the root on

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.080 
little bit of backcombing at the root on
the<00:03:54.540> top<00:03:54.750> section<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.610> is<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.880> go

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
over the top layer yeah I just have the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.390 
over the top layer yeah I just have the
fact<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.440> you're<00:04:31.620> not<00:04:31.710> having<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.040> load<00:04:32.190> it

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
fact that you're not having to load it

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.790 
fact that you're not having to load it
for<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.640> products<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.020> feels<00:04:34.050> really

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
for the products it's it feels really

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.550 
for the products it's it feels really
light<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.340> if<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.640> hair<00:04:35.850> feels<00:04:36.120> soft<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
light and if the hair feels soft and and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.100 
light and if the hair feels soft and and
glossy<00:04:38.010> rather<00:04:38.580> than<00:04:38.880> sticky<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.080> a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
glossy rather than sticky in like a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.190 
glossy rather than sticky in like a
bird's<00:04:40.380> nest<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:41.540> think<00:04:42.540> it's<00:04:42.660> important<00:04:43.080> not

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
bird's nest I think it's important not

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.960 
bird's nest I think it's important not
to<00:04:43.260> overload<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:44.040> product<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.610> reason

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
to overload this product and the reason

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.450 
to overload this product and the reason
for<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:45.419> because<00:04:46.040> actually<00:04:47.040> weighs<00:04:47.250> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
for that it's because actually weighs it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.909 
for that it's because actually weighs it
down<00:04:47.490> now<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.419> can<00:04:48.750> then<00:04:48.930> separate<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.620> like

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
down now you can then separate it like

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.010 
down now you can then separate it like
that<00:04:50.340> with<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.490> comb<00:04:50.820> another<00:04:51.330> way<00:04:51.510> of<00:04:51.630> doing<00:04:51.900> it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
that with a comb another way of doing it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.480 
that with a comb another way of doing it
is<00:04:52.140> with<00:04:52.290> your<00:04:52.410> fingers<00:04:52.830> I'll<00:04:53.010> show<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.250> that

is with your fingers I'll show you that

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.760 
is with your fingers I'll show you that
you<00:04:53.790> can<00:04:53.880> literally<00:04:54.419> just<00:04:54.620> separate<00:04:55.620> with

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
you can literally just separate with

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100 
you can literally just separate with
your<00:04:55.860> fingers<00:04:56.250> like<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.490> yes<00:04:57.120> -<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.960> way
