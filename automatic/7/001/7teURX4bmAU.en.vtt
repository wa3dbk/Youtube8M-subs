00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.310
 good morning and welcome to world 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.559
 unknown point is 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.110
 they all say it was a meteorite that 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.450
 extinguished the dinosaurs 65 ago 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.820
 millions of years 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 but and if it was not like that 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.020
 and if it was not a meteorite what 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.870
 extinguished the dinosaurs 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.140
 and if they have told us this hypothesis and 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.110
 it really does not fit with reality if 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.040
 it was another thing that is what I sting to 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.510
 the dinosaurs because they disappeared from 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.190
 all this we will talk in this video 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:43.360
 program you will see 65 million years ago 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.150
 suddenly a huge meteorite 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.340
 size approximately between 10 and 15 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.079
 kilometers in diameter very size 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.780
 considerable impact on the earth 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.469
 specifically fell in the Gulf of Mexico 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.079
 and concretely produced the call 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.059
 chicxulub crater 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.630
 the truth is that this is the call 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.899
 Álvarez hypothesis Mr. Álvarez is a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.869
 physical is not a paleontologist received the 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.380
 Nobel prize in his day and only for 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.320
 this sometimes makes me or gives me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.360
 quite reserves the Nobel prizes are 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.350
 they give very lightly are dependent on 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.159
 the un and the un is a chiringuito of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 many mobsters 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.149
 what really happens is that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.229
 maybe things were not like that according to 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.299
 that hypothesis 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.810
 apparently 50 percent of the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.640
 species 65 million years ago were 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.100
 destroyed or at least that's what 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.179
 it was believed to date today when I say today 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.479
 I'm talking about December 11, 2012 because 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.969
 to date a series of scientists 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.700
 according to a team of scientists with the 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.069
 nicolás langridge geologist and the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.250
 department of georgia and geology and 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.509
 geophysics of yale university 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.860
 they claimed the following must have been 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.810
 jointly between the unit 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.569
 Yale University and the University of 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 harvard because they claim that what is not 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.629
 they killed was 50 percent of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.700
 species killed 83 percent of the 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.129
 reptile species 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.440
 this scientist from the university of 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.300
 yale also claims that all that 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.520
 weighed more than half a kilo 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.950
 disappeared from the face of the earth 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.730
 curiously this theory plan 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.550
 discovered investigating a snake 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.490
 you know what that snake obama is called 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.850
 where 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.780
 obama dont gracilis a curious christening 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.000
 from obama I do not know if in honor of obama or in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.390
 actually make Sonora obama not what 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.650
 we know but that's the name obama do not 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.780
 investigating those snakes 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 they discovered that he also distinguished himself 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.150
 at that time 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.470
 that's why they came to these conclusions 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.430
 but the problem of the impact of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.019
 meteorite has a large fissure appear 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.970
 reach that conclusion of what happened 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.920
 65 million years ago for a series 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.450
 of isotopes or a series of 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.730
 modifications of the radiation of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.620
 ground 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.860
 but the meteor problem 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.630
 poses a paleontologist called crack 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.670
 keller 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.270
 a shovel in tolosa called crack keller 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.580
 who investigated the chicxulub crater 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.630
 and according to the extracts and the letters 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.850
 made by the paleontologist came to 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.970
 the conclusion that at best had 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.330
 three hundred thousand years old not 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 it had more, not much less than 65 million 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.310
 of years as we see the difference is 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.830
 remarkable between three hundred thousand years and 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.180
 the 65 million raised by the hypothesis 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.579
 Alvarez 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.990
 then what is it that killed the 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.750
 dinosaurs 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.240
 what is it that killed the dinosaurs is 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.480
 curious because a strange rigor appears 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.000
 mortis will see many dinosaurs ago 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.370
 150 million years began to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.710
 appear dinosaurs that is when 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.800
 appear the dinosaurs started to 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.650
 appear dinosaurs that had a 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.260
 strange way of dying these appeared 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.100
 with open mouths raised towards 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.190
 back and with the tail iniesta towards the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.980
 head you know when this occurs 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.650
 type of death 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.289
 when death is from poisoning 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.550
 cerebral 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:43.010
 the dinosaurs were poisoned 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.590
 but they want poison the dinosaurs to 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.500
 the dinosaurs that poisoned the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.780
 dinosaurs because he only killed the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.390
 great saurians now according to this theory 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.800
 he should kill all those who weighed 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.960
 more than half a kilo what technique they used 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.360
 who benefited from this murder in 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.439
 dough 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.439
 maybe mammals 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.580
 well three million of 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.620
 years for the appearance of the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.139
 intelligence in hominid mammals 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.290
 the reptiles had 18 million 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.910
 years of further evolution with which 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.520
 they had many more chances of 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.400
 get to evolve like reptiles 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.430
 smart that mammals and here 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.020
 they were much longer 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.889
 perhaps they destroyed some race 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.840
 smart reptile maybe there was 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.960
 perhaps that race of reptiles has gone to 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.720
 some place has disappeared 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.210
 There are many strange questions that 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.720
 can be stated the truth is that the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.660
 enigma is there and continues as we see 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.600
 everything we touch seems to exist 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.200
 a mystery and the official science does not 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.350
 wants or can not fit correctly 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.100
 the pieces of that puzzle to get 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:07.250
 a clear and realistic picture teach us 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:12.230
 sketches of abstract paintings that we 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.990
 we have to force us to assimilate 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.870
 when really maybe things do not 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.100
 they were well thought of in all this 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.650
 who poisoned the dinosaurs because 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.420
 as they did where they are if it is that 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.800
 is it so 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.919
 they are many questions 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.979
 without more from unknown world point is 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.180
 see you in the next video program 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.180
 to plant
