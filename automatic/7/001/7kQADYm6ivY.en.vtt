00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.949 

this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> very<00:00:02.100> common<00:00:02.550> style<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.270> LED

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
this is a very common style of LED

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.400 
this is a very common style of LED
string<00:00:04.770> late<00:00:05.279> these<00:00:05.520> days<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.120> it's<00:00:07.080> really

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
string late these days and it's really

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.030 
string late these days and it's really
clever<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:09.090> uses<00:00:09.510> two<00:00:09.780> varnished<00:00:10.620> copper

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
clever and it uses two varnished copper

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740 
clever and it uses two varnished copper
wires<00:00:11.280> they're<00:00:11.849> covered<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.240> some<00:00:12.480> sort<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
wires they're covered in some sort of

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.990 
wires they're covered in some sort of
lacquer<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> normal<00:00:14.370> winding

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
lacquer just like the normal winding

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
lacquer just like the normal winding
wire<00:00:15.179> you'd<00:00:15.389> find<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.929> solenoids<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.560> coils

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
wire you'd find for solenoids and coils

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.429 
wire you'd find for solenoids and coils
and<00:00:17.449> I'm<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.750> cover<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.050> over<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
and I'm just going to cover this over so

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.929 
and I'm just going to cover this over so
you<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.619> actually<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.520> bright

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you can actually see just how bright

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
you can actually see just how bright
these<00:00:21.119> look<00:00:22.910> really<00:00:23.910> colorful<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
these look really colorful and but the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
these look really colorful and but the
strange<00:00:26.279> thing<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.849> arrangement<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
strange thing about this arrangement is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.019 
strange thing about this arrangement is
all<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> LEDs<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.529> parallel<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> they're

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
all the LEDs are in parallel and they're

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
all the LEDs are in parallel and they're
just<00:00:30.269> heard<00:00:30.750> from<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.140> couple<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.590> double-a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
just heard from a couple of double-a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.990 
just heard from a couple of double-a
cells<00:00:33.050> now<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:35.040> interesting<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.969> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
cells now the interesting thing is that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
cells now the interesting thing is that
these<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.329> surface<00:00:36.660> mount<00:00:36.690> LEDs<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.770> I'll

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
these are surface mount LEDs and I'll

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
these are surface mount LEDs and I'll
just<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.800> little<00:00:40.800> bit<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:42.500> little

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
just get a little a little bit of little

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.060 
just get a little a little bit of little
sketch<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> doodler<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.920> they're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sketch a doodler on the way they're

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.389 
sketch a doodler on the way they're
manufactured<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.510> appears<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.440> use

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
manufactured is it appears that the use

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
manufactured is it appears that the use
surface<00:00:53.640> mount<00:00:53.820> LEDs<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.930> pads<00:00:55.590> folded

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
surface mount LEDs with the pads folded

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.830 
surface mount LEDs with the pads folded
underneath<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.329> normally<00:00:57.480> mount

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
underneath so these would normally mount

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.420 
underneath so these would normally mount
on<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> circuit<00:00:58.440> board<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.010> case<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
on a circuit board but in this case that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.889 
on a circuit board but in this case that
actually<00:00:59.550> made<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> onto<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> wires<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
actually made you onto the wires and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.500 
actually made you onto the wires and
there's<00:01:01.859> obviously<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:02.820> heavily

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
there's obviously some very heavily

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
there's obviously some very heavily
automated<00:01:03.960> process<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.970> involves<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
automated process that involves the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.250 
automated process that involves the
wires<00:01:07.229> being<00:01:07.530> pushed<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> point<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
wires being pushed up into a point and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
wires being pushed up into a point and
and<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.710> buffed<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.640> remove<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.720> lacquer

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then buffed to remove the lacquer

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
and then buffed to remove the lacquer
off<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.560> end<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.640> press<00:01:15.060> take<00:01:15.450> their

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
off the end and then press take their

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.550 
off the end and then press take their
games<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> Bach<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> led<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.720> soldered<00:01:18.720> then

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
games the Bach the led and soldered then

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
games the Bach the led and soldered then
the<00:01:19.740> whole<00:01:19.920> lot<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.700> dipped<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> resin<00:01:21.600> at

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the whole lot is just dipped in resin at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.730 
the whole lot is just dipped in resin at
that<00:01:22.049> point<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:24.360> forms<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that point and it forms a little bit of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.010 
that point and it forms a little bit of
resin<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.670> seals<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.900> mean

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
resin and it seals right around I mean

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
resin and it seals right around I mean
if<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.229> were<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:29.159> France<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.060> fur<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
if I were to say France or the fur to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.569 
if I were to say France or the fur to
lick<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.369> I'd

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
lick the back of these I don't think I'd

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.859 
lick the back of these I don't think I'd
get<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> tingle<00:01:33.600> often<00:01:33.900> excuse<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.950> licking

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
get a tingle often excuse me licking

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
get a tingle often excuse me licking
yeah<00:01:36.930> no<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.130> completely<00:01:38.310> insulated<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
yeah no it's completely insulated at the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
yeah no it's completely insulated at the
back<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:39.930> no

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
back there's no

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.160 
back there's no
tingle<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.640> M<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.570> suggests<00:01:42.780> these

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
tingle off that so M this suggests these

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690 
tingle off that so M this suggests these
may<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.740> quite<00:01:43.950> good<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.159> outdoor<00:01:44.670> use

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
may actually quite good for outdoor use

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
may actually quite good for outdoor use
because<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.020> true<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> sealed

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
because I'm there well true is sealed

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.609 
because I'm there well true is sealed
however<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> limitation<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:52.320> em

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
however and it's not a limitation but em

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
however and it's not a limitation but em
you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.420> LEDs<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:55.049> been

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you know they are all the LEDs have been

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
you know they are all the LEDs have been
parallel<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:57.290> because<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:59.009> suppose<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
parallel and because I suppose that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.280 
parallel and because I suppose that
could<00:01:59.759> make<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> series<00:02:00.509> circuit<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
could make a series circuit but for

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
could make a series circuit but for
manufacturing<00:02:01.920> simplicity<00:02:02.490> they're<00:02:03.390> all

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
manufacturing simplicity they're all

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.940 
manufacturing simplicity they're all
wired<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.840> parallel<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> means<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
wired in parallel and that means that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.490 
wired in parallel and that means that
the<00:02:05.880> red<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.479> are<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.780> bail<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.020> voltage

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the red one which are on bail or voltage

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.469 
the red one which are on bail or voltage
is<00:02:07.619> actually<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.129> blue<00:02:08.340> LED<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.789> red<00:02:08.970> phosphor

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is actually a blue LED with red phosphor

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.380 
is actually a blue LED with red phosphor
so<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.590> these<00:02:10.770> LEDs<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.220> blue<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.910> phosphor

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so all these LEDs are blue with phosphor

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.350 
so all these LEDs are blue with phosphor
except<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> green

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
except for the green

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.570 
except for the green
which<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.630> its<00:02:13.810> own<00:02:13.900> color<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.040> green<00:02:15.550> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
which is its own color but the green is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.040 
which is its own color but the green is
the<00:02:15.730> same<00:02:15.970> technologies<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> blues<00:02:16.780> they're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
the same technologies a blues they're

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.600 
the same technologies a blues they're
also<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.410> voltage<00:02:17.830> matched<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.120> thus<00:02:20.610> pretty

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
also a voltage matched so thus pretty

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.880 
also a voltage matched so thus pretty
good<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:22.150> then<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.620> most<00:02:23.770> recent

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
good but then the most recent

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.700 
good but then the most recent
introduction<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.780> lighting

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
introduction on to the the lighting

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.890 
introduction on to the the lighting
scene<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:28.320> 100<00:02:29.320> LED<00:02:29.710> steps<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.660> was

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
scene is the 100 LED steps and I was

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.570 
scene is the 100 LED steps and I was
kind<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.170> intrigued<00:02:32.590> because<00:02:32.860> particularly

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
kind of intrigued because particularly

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.490 
kind of intrigued because particularly
cuz<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.910> operates<00:02:34.300> at<00:02:34.420> 12<00:02:34.720> volts<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.290> I'll

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
cuz it operates at 12 volts and I'll

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.940 
cuz it operates at 12 volts and I'll
just<00:02:35.680> plug<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.070> in<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.670> see<00:02:36.940> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
just plug this in and you can see it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.030 
just plug this in and you can see it
there<00:02:38.950> dazzling<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.800> quite<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
there dazzling and so this is quite a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.000 
there dazzling and so this is quite a
long<00:02:42.220> string<00:02:42.670> 100<00:02:43.450> LEDs<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.890> was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
long string 100 LEDs in it and I was

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.560 
long string 100 LEDs in it and I was
thinking<00:02:45.310> well<00:02:45.490> they're<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.270> parallel

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
thinking well they're all in parallel

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.090 
thinking well they're all in parallel
are<00:02:46.959> they<00:02:47.080> certainly<00:02:47.440> seem<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.740> be<00:02:47.890> on

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
are they certainly seem to be on

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.540 
are they certainly seem to be on
parallel<00:02:48.510> which<00:02:49.510> means<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.280> 12

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
parallel which means that the of the 12

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.949 
parallel which means that the of the 12
volts<00:02:51.970> there's<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.270> be<00:02:52.330> 3<00:02:52.570> volts<00:02:52.600> across

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
volts there's going to be 3 volts across

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.130 
volts there's going to be 3 volts across
LEDs<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.850> means<00:02:55.150> quite<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.750> lot<00:02:55.989> would

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
LEDs and that means quite a lot would

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.479 
LEDs and that means quite a lot would
have<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.410> dropped<00:02:56.590> across<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.070> resistor

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
have to be dropped across the resistor

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.100 
have to be dropped across the resistor
but<00:02:57.670> there's<00:02:57.880> no<00:02:58.000> obvious<00:02:58.270> resistor<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> mean

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
but there's no obvious resistor I mean

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.260 
but there's no obvious resistor I mean
there<00:02:59.230> could<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.530> resistor<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.070> here<00:03:00.430> but

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
there could be a resistor in here but

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.330 
there could be a resistor in here but
for<00:03:02.080> me<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.200> obvious<00:03:02.680> way<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.830> do<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.160> would

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
for me that obvious way to do this would

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.910 
for me that obvious way to do this would
be<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> wire<00:03:03.850> them<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.620> divide<00:03:05.620> them<00:03:05.800> into

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
be to wire them in divide them into

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.770 
be to wire them in divide them into
sections<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.920> 100<00:03:09.280> LEDs<00:03:09.550> 25<00:03:10.150> LEDs<00:03:10.570> per

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
sections and it's 100 LEDs 25 LEDs per

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.620 
sections and it's 100 LEDs 25 LEDs per
Section<00:03:11.290> maybe<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.910> were<00:03:12.910> then<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
Section maybe and were then like this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.509 
Section maybe and were then like this
where<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.720> get<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> 25<00:03:17.380> LEDs<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:18.130> parallel

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
where you get the 25 LEDs in parallel

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.420 
where you get the 25 LEDs in parallel
and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:19.150> another<00:03:19.840> 25<00:03:20.260> then<00:03:20.620> another<00:03:20.830> 25<00:03:21.190> and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
and then another 25 then another 25 and

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.880 
and then another 25 then another 25 and
not<00:03:21.519> 25<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> wire<00:03:22.750> going<00:03:23.650> across

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
not 25 and that is a wire going across

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.570 
not 25 and that is a wire going across
the<00:03:24.489> fill<00:03:24.730> run<00:03:25.000> em<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.890> parallel<00:03:27.340> array

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
the fill run em of this parallel array

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.870 
the fill run em of this parallel array
that<00:03:29.070> goes<00:03:30.070> right<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.549> very<00:03:30.640> end

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
that goes right to the very end

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.340 
that goes right to the very end
suggesting<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.690> something<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.230> is

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
suggesting that something like that is

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.380 
suggesting that something like that is
done<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.799> very<00:03:32.920> carefully<00:03:33.459> felt<00:03:33.940> along<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
done so I very carefully felt along the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.020 
done so I very carefully felt along the
the<00:03:34.660> set<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.989> ours<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:36.370> was<00:03:36.580> right<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.000> was

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
the set of ours and I was right it was

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.590 
the set of ours and I was right it was
every<00:03:37.420> 25<00:03:37.900> LEDs<00:03:38.350> as<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.590> little<00:03:38.950> joint<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:42.600> it's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
every 25 LEDs as a little joint and it's

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.190 
every 25 LEDs as a little joint and it's
very<00:03:43.930> clever<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.209> little<00:03:46.480> bit<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.049> heat

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
very clever it's a little bit of heat

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.759 
very clever it's a little bit of heat
shrink<00:03:47.230> sleeping<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.269> what<00:03:49.269> they've<00:03:49.420> done<00:03:49.450> is

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
shrink sleeping and what they've done is

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.580 
shrink sleeping and what they've done is
the<00:03:50.769> first<00:03:51.130> 25<00:03:51.730> comes<00:03:52.060> along<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.540> then<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
the first 25 comes along and then the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.130 
the first 25 comes along and then the
wire<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.400> wires<00:03:54.610> get<00:03:54.910> cut<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.360> then<00:03:55.570> tag<00:03:55.989> it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
wire the wires get cut and then tag it

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.160 
wire the wires get cut and then tag it
across<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.280> set<00:03:58.269> then<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.750> ceded<00:03:59.080> to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
across so that set then is in ceded to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.530 
across so that set then is in ceded to
that<00:03:59.320> set<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.830> the<00:04:00.549> surplus<00:04:00.970> wire<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.360> just

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
that set and the surplus wire is just

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.420 
that set and the surplus wire is just
folded<00:04:01.989> back<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.709> trapped<00:04:03.130> inside

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
folded back and it's all trapped inside

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.630 
folded back and it's all trapped inside
the<00:04:03.850> heat<00:04:04.000> shrink<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.560> em<00:04:05.739> it's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the heat shrink like this so em it's

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.699 
the heat shrink like this so em it's
very<00:04:06.910> simple<00:04:07.360> but<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.570> does<00:04:08.080> leave<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
very simple but that does leave the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.210 
very simple but that does leave the
question<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.400> know<00:04:10.170> certainly<00:04:11.170> through<00:04:11.500> four

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
question you know certainly through four

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.039 
question you know certainly through four
circuits<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:12.970> three<00:04:13.209> volts<00:04:13.570> would<00:04:13.720> make<00:04:13.870> up

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
circuits of three volts would make up

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.319 
circuits of three volts would make up
the<00:04:14.200> 12<00:04:14.530> volts<00:04:14.920> but<00:04:15.040> really<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.610> wonder<00:04:16.090> if<00:04:16.180> as

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
the 12 volts but really I wonder if as

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.349 
the 12 volts but really I wonder if as
our<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.810> wonder<00:04:17.620> if<00:04:17.680> there's<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:18.269> resistor<00:04:19.269> in

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
our I wonder if there's a resistor in

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.839 
our I wonder if there's a resistor in
here<00:04:20.250> suppose<00:04:21.250> there's<00:04:21.400> only<00:04:21.520> one<00:04:21.669> way<00:04:21.820> to

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
here suppose there's only one way to

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.850 
here suppose there's only one way to
find<00:04:22.150> out

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.790 

and<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.930> carefully<00:04:27.930> cut<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.680> heat

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
and that is to carefully cut the heat

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.300 
and that is to carefully cut the heat
shrink<00:04:29.100> sleeving<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:31.010> see<00:04:32.010> if<00:04:32.070> there's<00:04:32.250> a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
shrink sleeving and see if there's a

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.120 
shrink sleeving and see if there's a
resistor<00:04:32.760> here<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:33.480> might<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.930> be

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
resistor here that might just be

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.710 
resistor here that might just be
balanced<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.310> voltage<00:04:35.640> because<00:04:36.480> there<00:04:36.570> is<00:04:36.690> a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
balanced the voltage because there is a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.010 
balanced the voltage because there is a
slight<00:04:36.930> voltage<00:04:37.500> knee<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.510> gallium

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
slight voltage knee and on the gallium

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.840 
slight voltage knee and on the gallium

regulated<00:04:45.900> twelve<00:04:46.170> volt<00:04:46.350> supply<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:47.010> would

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
regulated twelve volt supply that would

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.920 
regulated twelve volt supply that would
work<00:04:50.040> okay<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.480> picking<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:51.990> open

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
work okay so just have picking this open

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.300 
work okay so just have picking this open
just<00:04:54.930> unplug<00:04:55.350> this<00:04:55.440> amoun<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.010> sort<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
just unplug this amoun just sort of

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:06.310 
just unplug this amoun just sort of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.309 

knock<00:05:07.320> out<00:05:07.530> part<00:05:07.860> two

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.809 

oh<00:05:10.349> it's<00:05:11.099> quite<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.550> fruit<00:05:12.119> tree<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.629> say

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:25.860 

or<00:05:17.819> multiple<00:05:18.389> bits<00:05:18.539> of<00:05:18.719> heat-shrink<00:05:19.080> I

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:41.930 

don't<00:05:26.500> see<00:05:26.860> any<00:05:26.980> resistors

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.370 

let's<00:05:42.940> see<00:05:43.060> then<00:05:43.210> get<00:05:43.360> this<00:05:43.479> off<00:05:43.690> at<00:05:43.900> such<00:05:44.110> I

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
let's see then get this off at such I

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.339 
let's see then get this off at such I
think<00:05:44.560> it<00:05:44.650> made<00:05:44.770> me<00:05:44.889> glued<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:46.030> would<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.349> glue

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
think it made me glued you would be glue

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.540 
think it made me glued you would be glue
land<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:49.440> how<00:05:50.440> does<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.590> just<00:05:50.889> our<00:05:51.039> it's<00:05:51.430> a

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
land and how does that just our it's a

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.260 
land and how does that just our it's a
clear<00:05:51.910> heat<00:05:52.090> shrink<00:05:52.389> in<00:05:52.569> there<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:53.229> goes<00:05:54.270> no

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
clear heat shrink in there that goes no

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.559 
clear heat shrink in there that goes no
it<00:05:55.419> looks<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.990> all<00:05:56.110> intents<00:05:56.410> prophecies<00:05:57.569> as

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
it looks to all intents prophecies as

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.270 
it looks to all intents prophecies as
though<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.009> just<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:01.620> just<00:06:02.620> relying<00:06:03.009> on<00:06:03.220> a

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
though it is just the just relying on a

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.210 
though it is just the just relying on a
regulated<00:06:03.729> twelve<00:06:04.150> volt<00:06:04.330> supply<00:06:04.509> and<00:06:05.220> there

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
regulated twelve volt supply and there

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.770 
regulated twelve volt supply and there
are<00:06:06.310> being<00:06:06.720> four<00:06:07.720> parallel<00:06:08.699> circuits<00:06:09.780> with

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
are being four parallel circuits with

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.360 
are being four parallel circuits with
three<00:06:11.050> volts<00:06:11.319> across<00:06:11.380> each<00:06:11.740> or<00:06:11.949> wired<00:06:12.190> in<00:06:12.310> the

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
three volts across each or wired in the

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.580 
three volts across each or wired in the
series<00:06:12.759> yeah<00:06:13.419> that's<00:06:13.630> that<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:13.930> just<00:06:14.349> AM

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
series yeah that's that I just AM

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.379 
series yeah that's that I just AM
straight<00:06:15.220> through<00:06:15.550> there's<00:06:15.729> no<00:06:15.819> resistors<00:06:16.240> in

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
straight through there's no resistors in

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.790 
straight through there's no resistors in
there<00:06:16.569> it's<00:06:16.690> just<00:06:16.780> soldered<00:06:17.289> straight<00:06:17.650> on

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
there it's just soldered straight on

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.809 
there it's just soldered straight on
with<00:06:18.490> lots<00:06:18.699> of<00:06:18.819> little<00:06:18.909> bits<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.270> sleeving

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
with lots of little bits of sleeving

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.059 
with lots of little bits of sleeving
okay<00:06:21.819> so<00:06:22.479> yeah<00:06:22.630> so<00:06:23.319> that's<00:06:23.440> how<00:06:23.650> these<00:06:23.800> work

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
okay so yeah so that's how these work

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.740 
okay so yeah so that's how these work
these<00:06:24.550> are<00:06:24.610> neat<00:06:24.909> they're<00:06:25.180> very<00:06:25.360> cheap<00:06:25.569> as

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
these are neat they're very cheap as

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.920 
these are neat they're very cheap as
well

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
well

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.300 
well
probably<00:06:26.500> because<00:06:26.620> they're<00:06:26.860> easily

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
probably because they're easily

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.659 
probably because they're easily
mass-produced<00:06:28.150> by<00:06:28.180> machine<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:30.520> yeah

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
mass-produced by machine and so yeah

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.969 
mass-produced by machine and so yeah
that's<00:06:30.909> nice<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.720> really<00:06:32.199> take<00:06:32.409> your<00:06:32.590> shame<00:06:32.800> to

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
that's nice I really take your shame to

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.370 
that's nice I really take your shame to
these<00:06:33.099> lights
