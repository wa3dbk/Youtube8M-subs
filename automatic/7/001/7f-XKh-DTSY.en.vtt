yeah in it so it was necessary for

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.949 
yeah in it so it was necessary for
everybody<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.270> we<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:54.989> win<00:02:55.530> today<00:02:56.070> and

with<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.600> only<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> result<00:03:22.110> today

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
with the it's not only the result today

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.860 
with the it's not only the result today
I<00:03:22.950> thought<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.519> was<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.910> game<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.630> played

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I thought it was the game that we played

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.729 
I thought it was the game that we played
and<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.950> think<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.840> really<00:03:27.840> result<00:03:28.500> we

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
and I think it was a really result we

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.590 
and I think it was a really result we
are<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.160> better<00:03:29.400> team<00:03:29.519> today<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.750> yeah<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.700> it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
are the better team today and yeah so it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.920 
are the better team today and yeah so it
will<00:03:33.810> give<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:35.400> confidence<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.330> can

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
will give the confidence that we can

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.530 
will give the confidence that we can
avoid<00:03:37.530> relegation<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.580> we<00:03:38.940> can<00:03:39.120> stay<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
avoid relegation and we can stay in the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:50.810 
avoid relegation and we can stay in the
lead<00:03:47.450> was<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.510> hard<00:03:48.989> decision<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.500> Martin<00:03:50.130> but

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
lead was a hard decision for Martin but

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.970 
lead was a hard decision for Martin but
he<00:03:51.390> has<00:03:51.780> taken<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.890> very<00:03:52.920> well

the<00:03:56.070> idea<00:03:56.430> was<00:03:56.810> Martin<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:59.209> quiet<00:04:00.209> keeper<00:04:01.049> he

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the idea was Martin is quiet keeper he

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.490 
the idea was Martin is quiet keeper he
is<00:04:02.480> not<00:04:03.480> loud<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:05.060> David<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.510> more<00:04:06.959> exciting
