00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
my preference is the poppet as close to
the<00:01:37.619> top<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> rev<00:01:38.250> range<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.570> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the top of the rev range as I can in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.789 
the top of the rev range as I can in
this<00:01:40.170> case<00:01:40.939> 5500<00:01:41.939> rpm<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.960> reason<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.680> we

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
this case 5500 rpm the reason is if we

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.580 
this case 5500 rpm the reason is if we
pop<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.729> only<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.060> 5,000<00:01:45.750> rpm<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> engine

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
pop it to only get 5,000 rpm the engine

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
pop it to only get 5,000 rpm the engine
will<00:01:46.740> labor<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.340> drop<00:01:47.579> below<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:48.030> Rebs<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
will labor and drop below these Rebs and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
will labor and drop below these Rebs and
go<00:01:48.869> through<00:01:49.079> excessive<00:01:49.470> fuel<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.369> heavier

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the boat phoned me up and told me you

the boat phoned me up and told me you

inch diameter propellers off and put

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.480 
inch diameter propellers off and put
more<00:02:25.720> picture<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.620> faster<00:02:27.310> I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
more picture on so you can go faster I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.860 
more picture on so you can go faster I
said<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:28.060> did<00:02:28.120> your<00:02:28.270> maximum<00:02:28.690> achievable

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
said what did your maximum achievable

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.200 
said what did your maximum achievable
rpm<00:02:29.800> he<00:02:29.860> said<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.070> don't<00:02:30.130> run<00:02:30.400> at<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.850> maximum

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
rpm he said I don't run at a maximum

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.110 
rpm he said I don't run at a maximum
throttle<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> can't<00:02:32.680> help<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.160> found<00:02:33.970> out

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
throttle so I can't help it I found out

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
throttle so I can't help it I found out
later<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.540> was<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.750> newer<00:02:35.050> boat<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.530> he<00:02:35.590> added<00:02:35.830> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
later it was a newer boat and he added a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.350 
later it was a newer boat and he added a
lot<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.190> extra<00:02:36.610> weight<00:02:36.880> from<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.240> initial

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
lot of extra weight from the initial

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.200 
lot of extra weight from the initial
setup<00:02:37.810> he<00:02:38.620> really<00:02:38.920> needed<00:02:39.190> pitch<00:02:39.520> taken<00:02:39.940> off

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
setup he really needed pitch taken off

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.600 
setup he really needed pitch taken off
so<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> engine<00:02:41.200> spun<00:02:41.500> freer<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.280> achieve

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so the engine spun freer to achieve

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.810 
so the engine spun freer to achieve
maximum<00:02:43.150> rpm<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.930> better<00:02:44.110> speed<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:45.490> can't

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
maximum rpm and a better speed you can't

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.790 
maximum rpm and a better speed you can't
put<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> bigger<00:02:46.450> propeller<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.380> expect<00:02:47.740> to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
put a bigger propeller on and expect to

put a bigger propeller on and expect to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
go faster this only applies when you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.660 
go faster this only applies when you

have excess breads up your sleeves to

it's<00:02:56.560> more<00:02:56.800> likely<00:02:56.860> an<00:02:57.460> engine<00:02:57.880> problem

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
it's more likely an engine problem

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.080 
it's more likely an engine problem
people<00:02:58.990> always<00:02:59.230> blame<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.280> propeller<00:03:00.580> first

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090
