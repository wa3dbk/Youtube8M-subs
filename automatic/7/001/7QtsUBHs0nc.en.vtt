00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
important openings it actually turns

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090 
important openings it actually turns
white<00:02:04.450> that's<00:02:04.840> called<00:02:05.080> electrolysis<00:02:05.710> right

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
white that's called electrolysis right

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.280 
white that's called electrolysis right
there<00:02:06.310> when<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.730> happens<00:02:07.150> and<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:08.080> turns

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
there when that happens and it turns

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.530 
there when that happens and it turns
white<00:02:08.440> eats<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.250> away<00:02:09.520> these<00:02:09.940> things<00:02:10.179> start

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
white eats it away these things start

white eats it away these things start
thinking<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.800> become<00:02:12.100> no<00:02:12.280> good<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.640> you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
thinking and they become no good to you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.790 
thinking and they become no good to you
they've<00:02:13.360> made<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> pretty<00:02:14.020> much<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.380> exact

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
they've made a pretty much an exact

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.980 
they've made a pretty much an exact
reproduction<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.820> thing<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.570> got<00:02:16.780> like

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
reproduction of this thing it's got like

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.200 
reproduction of this thing it's got like
a<00:02:17.020> correct<00:02:17.410> forward<00:02:17.770> part<00:02:18.010> number<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.490> it's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
a correct forward part number on it it's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.060 
a correct forward part number on it it's
got<00:02:19.390> an<00:02:19.480> area<00:02:19.810> here<00:02:20.080> for<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> dipstick<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.950> be

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
got an area here for the dipstick to be

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.550 
got an area here for the dipstick to be
slid<00:02:21.400> into<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.690> don't<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> dipstick

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
slid into if you don't have a dipstick

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.949 
slid into if you don't have a dipstick
because<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.190> maybe<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.490> eighties<00:02:25.390> Mustang

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
because it's maybe a eighties Mustang

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.530 
because it's maybe a eighties Mustang
they<00:02:26.890> give<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.370> nice<00:02:27.610> little<00:02:27.820> plug<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
they give you this nice little plug to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.500 
they give you this nice little plug to
put<00:02:28.780> inside<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.410> dipstick<00:02:29.830> tube<00:02:30.430> hole<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
put inside the dipstick tube hole so you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.590 
put inside the dipstick tube hole so you
don't<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.020> use<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.790> yours<00:02:34.090> has<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
don't have to use it if yours has the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.290 
don't have to use it if yours has the
indicator<00:02:35.230> pointer<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.100> pick<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.520> area<00:02:36.880> an

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
indicator pointer on it pick one area an

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.730 
indicator pointer on it pick one area an
early<00:02:37.720> months<00:02:37.930> time<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.530> pretty

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
early months time this is pretty

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320 
early months time this is pretty
critical<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.490> even<00:02:39.760> include<00:02:40.120> this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
critical here they even include this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.550 
critical here they even include this
thing<00:02:40.540> here<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> timing

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
thing here this is for the timing

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
thing here this is for the timing
pointer<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.640> attaches<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.450> side<00:02:43.690> of

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
pointer which attaches to the side of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600 
pointer which attaches to the side of
this<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.890> they've<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.340> thought<00:02:45.580> about

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
this so they've really thought about

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.199 
this so they've really thought about
everything<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:46.450> they've<00:02:46.630> made<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.020> part

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
everything when they've made this part

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.199 
everything when they've made this part
it<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.450> paintable<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.800> wipe<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.490> down<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
it is paintable if you wipe it down and

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.620 
it is paintable if you wipe it down and
take<00:02:52.420> some<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> grease<00:02:54.489> off<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.970> or<00:02:55.239> or
