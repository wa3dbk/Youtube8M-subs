now<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> think<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.550> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> be<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
now I think that it's going to be the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
now I think that it's going to be the
guy<00:02:54.270> who<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> best<00:02:55.230> start<00:02:55.860> off<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
guy who can get the best start off the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.010 
guy who can get the best start off the
lights<00:02:56.610> they're<00:02:56.970> pretty<00:02:57.180> much<00:02:57.240> matched<00:02:57.630> up<00:02:57.930> at

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
lights they're pretty much matched up at

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.990 
lights they're pretty much matched up at
horsepower<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.400> very<00:02:59.640> key

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
horsepower so it's going to be very key
