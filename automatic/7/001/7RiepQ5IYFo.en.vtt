00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.549

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.929
 about me it's okay to write about me 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.700
 but I warn you have to be attentive to 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.469
 the signs when life gives you a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.329
 moment like this is a sin not 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.329
 take advantage of it is a sin 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.780
 and I'm convinced of that you have to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250
 Do everything you can and try to 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.630
 maximum and if you maintain optimism 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.780
 you will always have the good side of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.780
 things 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 and more
