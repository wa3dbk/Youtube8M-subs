and<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.680> thing<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.149> do

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and the thing is you know we we can do

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
and the thing is you know we we can do
this<00:00:45.539> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.079> simple<00:00:46.500> movement<00:00:46.829> stuff

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this sort of like simple movement stuff

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
this sort of like simple movement stuff
I<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> lost<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
I don't know where it's like a lost of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
I don't know where it's like a lost of
it<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> regular

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it the thing is we can do the regular

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
it the thing is we can do the regular
movement<00:00:51.180> stuff<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.660> since<00:00:51.960> we're<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.140> 3d<00:00:52.530> we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
movement stuff but since we're in 3d we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
movement stuff but since we're in 3d we
can<00:00:52.949> actually<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:54.300> more

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
can actually do something much more

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
can actually do something much more
compelling<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.039> him<00:00:56.250> sort<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
compelling so we can have him sort of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
compelling so we can have him sort of
Bend<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.059> us<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Bend into us because we have all the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.869 
Bend into us because we have all the
angles<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> controller<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.760> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
angles in the controller so I can like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
angles in the controller so I can like
stretch<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> blend<00:01:02.039> his

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
stretch them out and kind of blend his

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
stretch them out and kind of blend his
face<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.600> shows<00:01:03.840> on

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
face and you know this really shows on

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
face and you know this really shows on
this<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.409> debug<00:01:05.369> pattern<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.850> see

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this kind of debug pattern you can see

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.700 
this kind of debug pattern you can see
all<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> folds<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.720> twist<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
all the folds and twist that we can do I

controller<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.739> controlling<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.729> camera<00:02:10.940> you

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
controller is controlling the camera you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
controller is controlling the camera you
know<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.510> zoom<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:11.989> out<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.280> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
know it can zoom in and out and this is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.490 
know it can zoom in and out and this is
really<00:02:13.670> kind<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.000> neat<00:02:14.150> because<00:02:14.299> my<00:02:15.170> hands<00:02:15.380> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
really kind of neat because my hands a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800 
really kind of neat because my hands a
bit<00:02:15.620> shaky<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.579> thing<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:17.660> can

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
bit shaky but the thing is we can

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.740 
bit shaky but the thing is we can
actually<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:19.269> view<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> map

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
actually do this like view of the map

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.420 
actually do this like view of the map
right<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.769> imagine<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
right so you can imagine do it like a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400 
right so you can imagine do it like a
real<00:02:22.489> time<00:02:22.760> strategy<00:02:23.000> game<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:23.989> look<00:02:24.170> down

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
real time strategy game we can look down

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.870 
real time strategy game we can look down
and<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.799> can<00:02:24.920> like<00:02:25.069> look<00:02:25.250> at<00:02:25.430> look<00:02:25.670> at<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and you can like look at look at this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.430 
and you can like look at look at this
area<00:02:26.209> or<00:02:26.329> look<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:26.989> order<00:02:27.319> your

troops<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> other<00:02:28.099> controller<00:02:28.579> and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
troops with the other controller and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.819 
troops with the other controller and
then<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.599> know<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:30.049> do<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.349> 3d<00:02:30.650> right
