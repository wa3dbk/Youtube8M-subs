00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.670
 enthusiastic followers of the animation 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.150
 Japanese in our country enjoyed 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.219

 animation who invited by the center 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.970
 Peruvian cultural culture arrived by 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.919
 first time to Peru to make a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.320

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.630

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.670
 which he counted but even beyond 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.220
 In addition, citi was expected to be here in 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.510
 Peru or in South America there would be so many 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 so many fans of animation 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 Japanese who are far from Japan would be 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.579
 so popular 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.280
 thank you very much 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.820
 well in the year 2000 I was first 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.690
 in brazil in a very busy workshop 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.969
 for a month 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.519
 and then I've been to other countries like 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.570
 Uruguay, Colombia, Colombia and Venezuela. 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.799
 that I am very happy in that kind of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.299
 questions or what have been the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.400
 concerns the Peruvian public before 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.110
 shopping in all places 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.299
 concerns are always alike but 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 this time there were more interesting questions 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.049
 they asked me if the people who 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.640
 they study anime here they can go to japan and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.890
 find work and how would that be 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.300
 work 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 born in 1947 ishiguro has almost half 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.290
 century working in the field of 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 animation and between different projects 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.700
 important is recognized above all by 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.210
 have participated in the classic 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.190
 feature film the tomb of the fireflies 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.380
 one of the most moving productions 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.630
 that has been made in the country of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.190
 prominent collaborators of the popular 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.240
 pokémon series as a cartoonist 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 from the endearing pikachu 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.649
 16 in these days that everything is digital 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 things go straight from the paper to the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.210
 computer futures line for the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.170
 Japanese the same thing is all digital like 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.750
 The US states in the USA are all made 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 digitally on the computer but in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 japan first we draw the paper and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.269
 when we have everything ready 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.190
 we use the computer 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.019
 that is to say that the tradition of 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 the animation to paper and then it goes to the 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.230
 Pints are added computer do the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.060
 special effects but animation in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.340
 yes it stays traditional way 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 that's how he talked about the time it takes to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 be a short or an animated feature 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.330
 for example 30 minutes of a chapter of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.340
 pokemon we were doing in three 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.500
 months 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.590
 also and safe when at the beginning of the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.150
 70 his own studio plays as with the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.150
 who has made numerous productions 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.130
 animated over four decades in 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.530
 the last years has gained more fame 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.400
 to have been the director of power of wars 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.260
 zeta 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.530
 the oriental version of the girls 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.530
 superpowerful 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.240
 I never thought to do anime to me what 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.190
 I liked the paintings to lonia and 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.770
 if it enters the anime was pure 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.650
 chance so there's nothing that I 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.140
 have inspired in concrete ended badly 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.470
 before I applied to the university to 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.330
 do oil paintings but I did not enter and in that 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.820
 time that I started preparing myself for 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.640
 postulate again was that I started in 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.650
 the world of melilla how was the work 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.630
 when he was with the study of miyazaki 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.750
 which is one of the most wanted movies 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.760
 at least here for the fans 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.950
 with the study of miyazaki I had the honor 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.350
 to make the feature film of the tomb of 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.270
 the fireflies his vague cited is a 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.270
 excellent work and of the highest quality 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.610
 from the heart 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.950
 Remember totoró if you love me 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.180
 neighbor totoro is here he this bull so 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.180
 It looks like the doctor 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.840
 in the otaku fest 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:08.610
