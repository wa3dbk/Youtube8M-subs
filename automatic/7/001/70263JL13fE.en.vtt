00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 good in the middle of the channel I'm encouraged that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.940
 for the economic and good people today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.820
 I bring a guide that many subscribers 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.679
 you are asking me to enlist and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.540
 in the flex of your for good well let's 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.540
 to start with enlisting the minotaur 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.840
 for people who know him I'm going to 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.820
 explain how I do the guides first 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.650
 Start by explaining your skills 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.750
 then the skill sequence and by 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.390
 last the equipment first 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.220
 we will talk about your passive trampling each 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.309
 time the spell distraction trample 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.200
 causes us to do damage for seconds to 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.610
 units of each that we have because 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.920
 hurts 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 well this wants us a good thing that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.180
 if we see that he is the one who holds a lot 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.100
 the damage luckily every fact that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.930
 we throw will hurt in our area 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 rivals 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 now we have the following ability 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.360
 spray as is left of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 spray while being hit with his 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.560
 fist to the ground and pnv we hurt in area 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.510
 to all nearby enemies and 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.580
 we launch into the air as the enemies fall 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.129
 that were boring stability comes very 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.900
 well to help the lane to control 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.119
 the situations as you know with 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.920
 stability we can mention together with 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.470
 the goring we raise our enemies 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.420
 and with the testarazo that is called the time 7 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.740
 skill we put it inside so that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 charge and you can kill him easily 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.479
 We can also deal with testarazo and 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.190
 hit just with that situation but 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.900
 that's going to have to be practiced a lot 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.120
 now we have testarazo as I said 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.650
 previously testarazo what it does is 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.200
 give an enemy goring and what 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.180
 we push back I have not said it already 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.940
 can combine together with the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
 mobilization in two ways or jumping 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.750
 with the intervention that there is 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.230
 practice it a lot or we do not raise if we 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.030
 we put inside 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.120
 now we have one of the skills I 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.230
 it matters to have a triumphant roar 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.000
 stability what it does is that it will subtract 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.210
 life to himself and in all units 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.070
 allies what happens that booking when going to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.040
 leave and which we recover half of 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.660
 life can also be released for pc 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.990
 this team if nearby enemies 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.970
 both domain and champions are dying 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.590
 happens a second stability is reduced 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.730
 It is very important to stand in the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.130
 line below to help the 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.940
 survival and then let game will not be 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.620
 as effective as a full hitler but it is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.300
 effective to put up with the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.570
 survival and endures for example the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.570
 turn on 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.900
 and finally we have an effective bearing 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.820
 accounting is final is very good 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.570
 for this reason in addition to when we have 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.970
 the additional damage is to say was attack 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.250
 It also makes us reduce 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.890
 physical and magical damage grandson this defect 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.110
 also if we are stunned slowed down 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.990
 if any effect harmful to the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.400
 character will be removed by that 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.410
 we transmit very good for example if 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.930
 we fought 4h that retirement of the definitive 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.940
 2 last since our definitive 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.150
 we remove that is this and you can with your 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.150
 actuate 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.620
 now let's talk about the sequence of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.720
 skills as you see we started with 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.880
 spray at level 1 to be able 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.040
 raise the enemies in areas at level 2 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.690
 we take a header to push it towards 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090
 inside or also to help the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.610
 partner to get rid of that pulse with the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 testarazo to your rival then as you see 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.530
 level 3 and we will prioritize without stopping is 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.870
 triumphant roar because it interests 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.150
 very much the triumphant roar very very 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.650
 quickly climbed to hold the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.180
 line with your partner 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.200
 then you will see that the size you go tablet 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.390
 you always upload the priority and you will see 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.240
 that then we will go up spray because 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.280
 it's second 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.810
 and it is growing much lower the td 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.210
 stability to be able to lift 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.410
 enemies in area finally as you will see 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.120
 of this reason it will be the last thing to go up 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.130
 when we started the game what 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.210
 we want to know about fairies and 4 equal green 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.290
 another new villain 3 valverde and 1 rosa 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.090
 personally I prefer green pasqual 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.500
 because it is interactive to hold more 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.450
 survival down perez people who 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.660
 prefers pink that is understood for 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.850
 prevent that supposes enemy keep that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.690
 the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.610
 the career will have more guarded and you 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.110
 you can keep it good that's what 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.420
 main then we go with the stone 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.030
 philosopher as you know all human life and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.380
 does not interest him or what is generating 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.390
 after the aspirations or fail we will catch 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.950
 the speed boot to keep us 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.040
 fastest lane and can support 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.810
 better to carry then let's catch what 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.510
 next that is the heart of gold 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.250
 because he is interested in life and follow 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.220
 generating more gold since we do not 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.360
 we kill children because we are the support 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.550
 then we will catch cities 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.620
 thank you so I can not do it later 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.740
 ice heart because that speed 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.240
 As you know they are much more and also we 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.250
 gives the possibility of holding more in the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.820
 lines now what we want the boot 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.590
 public 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.960
 many people have controversy with these 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.150
 boots to see with you really really interested 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.530
 because as you know a support has to 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.240
 Quickly reach the sites to the list of 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.130
 movement is needed quickly for 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.990
 can appear from the sides and 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.690
 help your classmates and the other move 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.130
 it is a prayer as you will see now 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.410
 we see in the dream of your line because 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.880
 we have taken very good advantage of the gold that 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.460
 we have obtained and we will be interested 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.380
 a lot would be to make your only active 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.300
 that as you know we increase the speed 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.190
 movement all the allies now yes 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.319
 now we will see the ice heart because 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.210
 the ice group so reduces us 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.580
 the growth as you know is not so 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.410
 well that every time we lose we reduce 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.509
 the attack speed of the enemies 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 this suited us very well in addition to its 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.710
 armor that does not give us with this we will be 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.680
 pretty hard in another way we should in 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.910
 a support of tax now as you know this 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.620
 The data is about living very well the 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.210
 characters are and carry 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.240
 characters that have physicists because 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.039
 every teacher of life 15 percent 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.110
 reduced foundation and we have 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.240
 one the only one nor grant the champions 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.979
 close allies a 12% life theft of 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.680
 we put a stable attack as you will see 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.110
 this comes in handy now we will catch on 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.449
 protection of attention because we are going to 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.639
 measure the position of the legion is over 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.560
 with the heart of gold and others comes 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.120
 very well for this reason every time 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.789
 Blasts enemies we say your 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.949
 movement speed besides that is 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.880
 massive single so he has done the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.460
 selection 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.470
 of more than 5 percent very good mature 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.150
 a perfect life and we also have 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.060
 a single active that slows down 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.670
 Attack movement of enemies 25% 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.770
 this comes in handy but that very well 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.140
 to endure all the battles of late 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.420
 game and as you know the last object and 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.980
 it is more according to the situation as we are his 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.260
 post is usually left reserved for 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.910
 which but if for example that the country 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.380
 with the situation quite controlled 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.990
 you can that's why they combined their national 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.910
 wait for water ice to be able to get up 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.980
 again to fight next to a little 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.870
 these colleagues as you know the last 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.070
 object is always seasonal good 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.740
 friends of the channel I hope you liked it

 always very many thanks for seeing me and 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.940
 a greeting to me remember that the 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.300
 masters and the dunes are in the 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.300
 decision
