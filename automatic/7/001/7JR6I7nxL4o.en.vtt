00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.969 

so<00:00:01.020> it's<00:00:01.140> already<00:00:01.350> kind<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.530> looking<00:00:01.800> like

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so it's already kind of looking like

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.949 
so it's already kind of looking like
it's<00:00:02.310> got<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.520> general<00:00:02.760> form<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.570> head<00:00:03.780> we

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
it's got the general form of a head we

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.840 
it's got the general form of a head we
just<00:00:04.170> need<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.410> add<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.310> specific

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
just need to add in the specific

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.730 
just need to add in the specific
topological<00:00:06.540> features<00:00:06.720> which<00:00:07.230> will<00:00:07.410> allow<00:00:07.589> us

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
topological features which will allow us

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.240 
topological features which will allow us
to<00:00:07.940> animate<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.120> structure<00:00:09.510> later<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:10.190> one<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
to animate the structure later on one of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.259 
to animate the structure later on one of
the<00:00:11.309> first<00:00:11.460> pictures<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.790> would<00:00:11.910> actually<00:00:12.150> do

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the first pictures I would actually do

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.089 
the first pictures I would actually do
is<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> eyes<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.259> right<00:00:13.410> now<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.040> see

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
is the eyes so right now as you can see

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.359 
is the eyes so right now as you can see
I'm<00:00:14.400> moving<00:00:15.299> these<00:00:15.420> vertices<00:00:15.780> back<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:17.100> kind

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I'm moving these vertices back to kind

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.090 
I'm moving these vertices back to kind
of<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:18.199> section<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> four<00:00:19.470> faces<00:00:19.949> which

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
of make section of four faces which

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
of make section of four faces which
mirror<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.119> little<00:00:21.539> bit<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> eye

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
mirror a little bit of what the eye

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.330 
mirror a little bit of what the eye
socket<00:00:22.949> would<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> second

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
socket would actually be the second

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.259 
socket would actually be the second
let's<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.519> here<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.699> long<00:00:26.789> i'm<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> take

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
let's see here as long i'm going to take

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
let's see here as long i'm going to take
these<00:00:28.070> faces<00:00:29.070> i'm<00:00:29.189> actually<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> remove

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
these faces i'm actually going to remove

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.410 
these faces i'm actually going to remove
them<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.650> extruding<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.420> then

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
them out by extruding first and then

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
them out by extruding first and then
producing<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> new<00:00:33.960> section<00:00:35.390> moving<00:00:36.390> these

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
producing a new section moving these

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
producing a new section moving these
faces<00:00:36.899> forward<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.410> vertices<00:00:37.710> forward<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
faces forward these vertices forward to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
faces forward these vertices forward to
produce<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> ridge<00:00:39.719> along<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.200> front<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
produce the ridge along in front of the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
produce the ridge along in front of the
nose<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:41.399> along<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> cheek<00:00:42.059> also<00:00:42.809> going

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
nose and also along the cheek also going

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
nose and also along the cheek also going
to<00:00:42.960> try<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.620> lines<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.190> sink<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to try and get these lines to sink a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.060 
to try and get these lines to sink a
little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:44.910> more<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> mouth<00:00:45.450> quickly

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
little bit more with the mouth quickly

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
little bit more with the mouth quickly
but<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:48.270> pink<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> little

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
but here we go put pink just a little

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
but here we go put pink just a little
bit<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> together<00:00:49.289> by<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> nose<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:55.340> there<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
bit in together by the nose and there we

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.470 
bit in together by the nose and there we
go<00:00:58.250> these<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.489> faces<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.059> let's<00:01:00.270> take

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
go these four faces here let's take

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
go these four faces here let's take
these<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.640> let's<00:01:02.640> extrude<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.890> produce

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
these and let's extrude them to produce

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.300 
these and let's extrude them to produce
some<00:01:05.820> better<00:01:05.970> result<00:01:06.920> just<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.070> sure<00:01:08.100> these

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some better result just make sure these

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
some better result just make sure these
vertices<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> correct<00:01:09.450> spot<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
vertices are the correct spot first and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.789 
vertices are the correct spot first and
and<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.720> takes<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> while<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.470> find<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and it just takes a while to find that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.480 
and it just takes a while to find that
exact<00:01:14.189> spot<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.700> need<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> switch<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
exact spot that you need so switch the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
exact spot that you need so switch the
face<00:01:17.700> component<00:01:18.150> mode<00:01:18.240> grab<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:18.869> faces

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
face component mode grab those faces

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.859 
face component mode grab those faces
that<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.590> talking<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.750> then<00:01:21.750> we'll

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that i was talking about and then we'll

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.390 
that i was talking about and then we'll
get<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> extrude<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> selected<00:01:22.920> component

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
get the extrude the selected component

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
get the extrude the selected component
feature<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.770> extrude<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.310> words<00:01:27.020> there

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
feature and extrude these in words there

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.890 
feature and extrude these in words there
it<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.869> switch<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.500> scale<00:01:31.770> tool<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
it is now switch the scale tool and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.060 
it is now switch the scale tool and
scale<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.500> into<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> eyes<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
scale it all the way into the eyes and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.069 
scale it all the way into the eyes and
from<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> front<00:01:38.790> ortho<00:01:39.390> view<00:01:39.659> i'm<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:39.930> going

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
from the front ortho view i'm now going

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.460 
from the front ortho view i'm now going
to<00:01:40.140> enter<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> vertex<00:01:41.189> component<00:01:41.729> mode<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
to enter the vertex component mode and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:59.190 
to enter the vertex component mode and
retrace<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.770> along<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> edge<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.420> eye

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.800 

once<00:01:59.799> I<00:01:59.920> have<00:02:00.070> these<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.460> place<00:02:00.670> we'll<00:02:01.630> take<00:02:01.780> a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
once I have these in place we'll take a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.240 
once I have these in place we'll take a
look<00:02:01.930> at<00:02:02.049> how<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.229> works<00:02:02.409> from<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> side<00:02:03.039> of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
look at how it works from the side of

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.709 
look at how it works from the side of
you<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.399> make<00:02:03.579> sure<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.090> two<00:02:04.240> views<00:02:04.539> are

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
you and make sure that the two views are

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.880 
you and make sure that the two views are
corresponding<00:02:05.469> together<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> as<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.769> can

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
corresponding together and as you can

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.210 
corresponding together and as you can
see<00:02:08.920> they're<00:02:09.220> not<00:02:09.360> exact<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.709> fudge

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
see they're not exact but we can fudge

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.250 
see they're not exact but we can fudge
it<00:02:12.400> around<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:12.790> bit<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:13.269> needed<00:02:13.660> i<00:02:13.810> also

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it around a little bit if needed i also

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.870 
it around a little bit if needed i also
want<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> pull<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:14.800> back<00:02:15.099> along<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.610> edge

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
want to pull these back along the edge

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.300 
want to pull these back along the edge
and<00:02:16.120> eventually<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.720> upper<00:02:17.709> eyelid<00:02:18.099> fold

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and eventually this upper eyelid fold

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.040 
and eventually this upper eyelid fold
we're<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> want<00:02:18.760> overhanging<00:02:19.360> slightly

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
we're going to want overhanging slightly

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.720 
we're going to want overhanging slightly
over<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.410> lower<00:02:20.620> i<00:02:20.709> will<00:02:21.160> look<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:21.610> we

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
over the lower i will look at that as we

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.050 
over the lower i will look at that as we
extrude<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.330> more<00:02:22.420> features<00:02:22.780> later

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
extrude out some more features later

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.009 
extrude out some more features later
we're<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.150> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> step<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:25.900> were

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
we're now kind of on a step we were

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.930 
we're now kind of on a step we were
looking<00:02:26.560> very<00:02:26.739> specifically<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.549> we're

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
looking very specifically at the I we're

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.130 
looking very specifically at the I we're
done<00:02:28.090> working<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.690> whole<00:02:28.870> head

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
done working with the whole head

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.140 
done working with the whole head
building<00:02:30.069> eyes<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.459> kind<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.670> consider<00:02:30.819> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
building eyes I kind of consider the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.210 
building eyes I kind of consider the
third<00:02:31.420> step<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.140> process<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.860> first<00:02:33.069> was

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
third step of this process the first was

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280 
third step of this process the first was
making<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.670> box<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.299> second<00:02:34.690> was<00:02:34.780> shaping<00:02:35.170> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
making the box the second was shaping it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.500 
making the box the second was shaping it
to<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> skull<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.069> third<00:02:36.970> step<00:02:37.209> here<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
to the skull and the third step here is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.460 
to the skull and the third step here is
you<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.959> getting<00:02:38.799> these<00:02:39.099> eyes<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.150> place

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
you see is getting these eyes in place

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.440 
you see is getting these eyes in place
now<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.590> was<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.769> good<00:02:41.890> time<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.239> save<00:02:43.239> out

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
now that was a good time to save out

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.910 
now that was a good time to save out
your<00:02:43.690> file<00:02:43.959> I'm<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.560> doing<00:02:44.680> this

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
your file I'm going to be doing this

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.250 
your file I'm going to be doing this
temporarily<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.819> hitting<00:02:46.030> ctrl<00:02:46.390> s<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:47.110> so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
temporarily just hitting ctrl s just so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.470 
temporarily just hitting ctrl s just so
I<00:02:47.290> don't<00:02:47.349> lose<00:02:47.709> my<00:02:47.769> progress<00:02:48.329> you'll<00:02:49.329> also

notice that from time to time I come in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
notice that from time to time I come in
and<00:02:51.160> will<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.430> softening<00:02:51.819> out<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.239> normals<00:02:52.630> to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
and will be softening out my normals to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.940 
and will be softening out my normals to
get<00:02:52.989> rid<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> hard<00:02:53.440> edges<00:02:53.650> from<00:02:53.890> the

calm

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920

what<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.610> see<00:03:26.760> now<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:26.910> before<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.510> put<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> Sun

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
what you see now is before I put the Sun

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.500 
what you see now is before I put the Sun
I<00:03:28.400> together<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.490> really<00:03:29.970> feel<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> need<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.420> get

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
I together I really feel I need to get

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.880 
I together I really feel I need to get
an<00:03:30.630> eyeball<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.680> I've<00:03:32.040> made<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.580> nurbs<00:03:32.910> here<00:03:33.390> and

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
an eyeball so I've made a nurbs here and

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.920 
an eyeball so I've made a nurbs here and
I'm<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.430> scale<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.599> put<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.750> into

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
I'm going to scale it and put it into

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.020 
I'm going to scale it and put it into
place<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.650> work<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:38.010> my<00:03:38.130> polygon<00:03:38.580> model

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
place to work with my polygon model

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.150 
place to work with my polygon model
which<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.319> course<00:03:40.530> currently<00:03:40.950> box

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
which I'm of course currently box

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.010 
which I'm of course currently box
modeling<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:42.239> put<00:03:42.360> this<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.569> place<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.930> in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
modeling to put this in place right in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.420 
modeling to put this in place right in
the<00:03:43.080> eye<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.620> rotate<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:44.010> forward

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
the eye and I like to rotate it forward

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.190 
the eye and I like to rotate it forward
so<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.700> kind<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.880> works<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.300> target<00:03:45.900> along

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so it kind of works like a target along

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.199 
so it kind of works like a target along
the<00:03:46.410> center<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.890> pupil<00:03:47.280> well<00:03:48.030> just

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the center of the pupil well just

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.990 
the center of the pupil well just
position<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.750> into<00:03:49.200> place<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.950> give<00:03:50.850> me<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
position this into place and give me a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.490 
position this into place and give me a
really<00:03:51.120> good<00:03:51.209> sort<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.540> heads<00:03:51.780> up<00:03:51.989> as<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> what

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
really good sort of heads up as to what

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.350 
really good sort of heads up as to what
I<00:03:52.530> need<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.769> do<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.040> get<00:03:53.280> around<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.880> eyeball

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
I need to do to get around this eyeball

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.059 
I need to do to get around this eyeball
so<00:03:55.110> I'll<00:03:55.200> fudge<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.560> around<00:03:55.739> just<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.040> little

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
so I'll fudge it around just a little

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.509 
so I'll fudge it around just a little
bit<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.670> can<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.060> what's<00:03:57.239> poking<00:03:57.480> out<00:03:57.810> here

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
bit now I can see what's poking out here

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.979 
bit now I can see what's poking out here
jump<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.640> wireframe<00:03:59.850> view<00:04:00.090> quickly<00:04:00.660> just<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
jump in a wireframe view quickly just to

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.650 
jump in a wireframe view quickly just to
move<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.620> around<00:04:02.239> there<00:04:03.239> we<00:04:03.360> go<00:04:03.450> that's

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
move that around there we go that's

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.880 
move that around there we go that's
about<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.900> close<00:04:04.049> as<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.350> get<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.769> might

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
about as close as I can get it I might

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.470 
about as close as I can get it I might
need<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.130> add<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.280> little<00:04:05.370> bit<00:04:05.549> more<00:04:05.760> geometry

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
need to add a little bit more geometry

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.479 
need to add a little bit more geometry
to<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:06.989> model<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.560> bit<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.920> get<00:04:08.310> that

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
to this model in a bit to get that

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.979 
to this model in a bit to get that
working<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.819> little<00:04:08.910> better<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.390> again<00:04:09.450> this

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
working a little better but again this

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.949 
working a little better but again this
is<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.350> looking<00:04:10.890> at<00:04:10.980> how<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.130> build<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.549> basic

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
the upper eyelid edge and I'll push down

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.130 
the upper eyelid edge and I'll push down
as<00:05:06.230> well<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.820> my<00:05:07.820> upper<00:05:08.510> eyelid<00:05:08.810> which<00:05:08.960> is

as well so that my upper eyelid which is
going<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.160> be<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.280> little<00:05:10.430> bit<00:05:10.550> more<00:05:10.670> defined<00:05:11.060> on

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
going to be a little bit more defined on

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.000 
going to be a little bit more defined on
the<00:05:11.360> top<00:05:11.570> is<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:11.930> little<00:05:12.050> bit<00:05:12.290> less<00:05:12.500> defined<00:05:12.920> on

the bottom so I'm going to get rid of

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.110 
the bottom so I'm going to get rid of
this<00:05:15.530> cream<00:05:15.860> specs<00:05:16.130> is<00:05:16.220> pushing<00:05:16.580> those<00:05:16.700> points

this cream specs is pushing those points

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.230 
this cream specs is pushing those points
down<00:05:17.420> here<00:05:17.930> along<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.590> bottom<00:05:18.770> edge<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.370> don't

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
down here along the bottom edge I don't

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.400 
down here along the bottom edge I don't
want<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.420> to<00:05:20.600> be<00:05:20.690> as<00:05:20.780> harsh<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.140> with<00:05:21.320> the

want that to be as harsh and with the
eyes<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.860> seem<00:05:22.040> very<00:05:22.250> puffy<00:05:28.510> one<00:05:29.510> of<00:05:29.600> things

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
eyes to seem very puffy one of things

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.820 
eyes to seem very puffy one of things
about<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.960> islands<00:05:30.230> is<00:05:30.320> you're<00:05:30.440> working<00:05:30.560> with

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
about the islands is you're working with

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.050 
about the islands is you're working with
them<00:05:30.980> is<00:05:31.100> you<00:05:31.160> got<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.340> make<00:05:31.490> sure<00:05:31.520> that<00:05:32.450> the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
them is you got to make sure that the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.550 
them is you got to make sure that the
inside<00:05:35.060> part<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.900> eye<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.020> park<00:05:36.350> closer

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
inside part of the eye the park closer

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.300 
inside part of the eye the park closer
to<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.830> notice<00:05:37.010> is<00:05:37.250> higher<00:05:38.140> than<00:05:39.140> it<00:05:40.040> would<00:05:40.190> be

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
to the notice is higher than it would be

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.400 
to the notice is higher than it would be
towards<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:40.670> middle<00:05:40.820> line<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.900> that<00:05:42.110> the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
towards the middle line and that the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.380 
towards the middle line and that the
part<00:05:42.710> further<00:05:42.980> away<00:05:43.070> from<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.520> eye<00:05:43.670> on<00:05:44.210> the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
part further away from the eye on the

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.020 
part further away from the eye on the
low<00:05:44.600> side<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.260> the<00:05:45.530> lowest<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:46.430> it<00:05:46.550> goes<00:05:46.760> and

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
low side is the lowest that it goes and

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
low side is the lowest that it goes and
so<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.240> don't<00:05:47.450> have<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.600> perfectly

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
so you don't have a perfectly

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.110 
so you don't have a perfectly
symmetrical<00:05:48.590> football<00:05:48.920> shape<00:05:49.190> one<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.090> things

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
symmetrical football shape one of things

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.580 
symmetrical football shape one of things
I'd<00:05:50.330> like<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.480> do<00:05:50.630> as<00:05:50.750> well<00:05:50.900> as<00:05:50.930> I<00:05:51.110> continue<00:05:51.530> to

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
I'd like to do as well as I continue to

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.100 
I'd like to do as well as I continue to
build<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:52.100> upper<00:05:52.940> eyelid<00:05:53.360> and<00:05:53.510> lower<00:05:53.690> eyelid

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
build this upper eyelid and lower eyelid

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.540 
build this upper eyelid and lower eyelid
is<00:05:54.260> that<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.890> want<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:55.100> make<00:05:55.310> in<00:05:55.460> this

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
is that I want to make in this

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.950 
is that I want to make in this
corner<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:56.150> I'm<00:05:56.270> starting<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.600> get<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:56.900> a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
corner that I'm starting to get it a

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.300 
corner that I'm starting to get it a
little<00:05:57.020> bit<00:05:57.200> of<00:05:57.230> an<00:05:57.350> overhang<00:05:57.740> on<00:05:58.160> these

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
little bit of an overhang on these

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.400 
little bit of an overhang on these
points<00:05:58.550> because<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.090> upper<00:05:59.660> eyelid<00:06:00.020> actually

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
points because the upper eyelid actually

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.770 
points because the upper eyelid actually
does<00:06:00.620> overhang<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.550> lower<00:06:01.820> eyelid<00:06:02.390> just<00:06:02.690> a

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
does overhang that lower eyelid just a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.040 
does overhang that lower eyelid just a
little<00:06:03.020> bit<00:06:03.140> at<00:06:04.010> get<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> third<00:06:04.850> edge<00:06:05.120> loop<00:06:05.840> onto

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
little bit at get a third edge loop onto

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.550 
little bit at get a third edge loop onto
this<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:07.510> now<00:06:08.510> I'll<00:06:08.690> really<00:06:08.990> start<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.440> be

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
this and now I'll really start to be

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.090 
this and now I'll really start to be
able<00:06:09.590> to<00:06:09.800> get<00:06:09.950> this<00:06:10.130> overhang<00:06:11.060> happening<00:06:15.100> go

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
able to get this overhang happening go

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.460 
able to get this overhang happening go
and<00:06:16.280> pinch<00:06:16.669> this<00:06:16.880> back<00:06:17.120> in<00:06:17.360> a<00:06:17.390> little<00:06:17.570> bit<00:06:17.690> now

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
and pinch this back in a little bit now

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.810 
and pinch this back in a little bit now
it's<00:06:18.650> really<00:06:18.800> going<00:06:18.950> to<00:06:19.010> start<00:06:19.160> working<00:06:21.820> and

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
it's really going to start working and

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.250 
it's really going to start working and
my<00:06:22.910> eyes<00:06:23.060> do<00:06:23.300> kind<00:06:23.510> of<00:06:23.570> puff<00:06:23.750> out<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:23.930> little<00:06:24.140> bit

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
my eyes do kind of puff out a little bit

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.840 
my eyes do kind of puff out a little bit
too<00:06:24.410> much<00:06:24.590> towards<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:24.980> sides<00:06:25.280> but<00:06:25.580> we<00:06:25.700> can

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
too much towards the sides but we can

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.640 
too much towards the sides but we can
take<00:06:25.970> care<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.240> that<00:06:26.360> later<00:06:29.230> one<00:06:30.230> more<00:06:30.440> EDS

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
take care of that later one more EDS

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.760 
take care of that later one more EDS
loop<00:06:30.860> here<00:06:31.100> don't<00:06:31.370> define<00:06:31.820> that<00:06:32.090> cavity<00:06:32.540> and<00:06:32.770> I

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
loop here don't define that cavity and I

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.700 
loop here don't define that cavity and I
think<00:06:34.160> we're<00:06:34.310> pretty<00:06:34.430> good<00:06:35.260> move<00:06:36.260> around<00:06:36.440> some

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
think we're pretty good move around some

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.260 
think we're pretty good move around some
of<00:06:36.770> these<00:06:36.860> vertices<00:06:37.190> make<00:06:37.760> sure<00:06:37.910> we<00:06:38.000> got<00:06:38.120> the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
of these vertices make sure we got the

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.490 
of these vertices make sure we got the
depth<00:06:38.540> coming<00:06:38.840> from<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:40.000> upper<00:06:41.000> I<00:06:41.500> eyebrow

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
depth coming from the upper I eyebrow

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.230 
depth coming from the upper I eyebrow
area<00:06:42.710> and<00:06:45.040> will<00:06:46.040> soften<00:06:46.280> our<00:06:46.490> normals<00:06:46.850> here<00:06:47.090> in

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
area and will soften our normals here in

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
area and will soften our normals here in
just<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.840> second<00:06:48.320> there<00:06:48.860> we<00:06:48.980> go<00:06:50.260> looking

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
just the second there we go looking

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.310 
just the second there we go looking
pretty<00:06:51.440> good<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:52.300> we've<00:06:53.300> now<00:06:53.840> been<00:06:53.990> able<00:06:54.140> to

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
pretty good and we've now been able to

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.850 
pretty good and we've now been able to
complete<00:06:55.250> the<00:06:55.880> eye<00:06:59.290> in<00:07:00.290> this<00:07:00.440> next<00:07:00.650> section

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
complete the eye in this next section

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.320 
complete the eye in this next section
we're<00:07:01.130> going<00:07:01.220> to<00:07:01.310> look<00:07:01.400> at<00:07:02.320> manipulating<00:07:03.320> the

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
we're going to look at manipulating the

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.990 
we're going to look at manipulating the
faces<00:07:05.330> along<00:07:05.690> the<00:07:05.960> mouth<00:07:06.530> and<00:07:07.370> we'll<00:07:07.729> start

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
faces along the mouth and we'll start

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.610 
faces along the mouth and we'll start
your<00:07:08.210> by<00:07:08.330> pushing<00:07:08.870> around<00:07:09.020> the<00:07:09.200> nose<00:07:09.410> a<00:07:09.440> little

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
your by pushing around the nose a little

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.360 
your by pushing around the nose a little
bit

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
bit

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.830 
bit
but<00:07:10.790> I<00:07:11.060> really<00:07:11.270> want<00:07:11.389> to<00:07:11.449> take<00:07:11.510> a<00:07:11.570> look<00:07:11.690> here<00:07:11.810> at

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
but I really want to take a look here at

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.780 
but I really want to take a look here at
the<00:07:11.960> mouth<00:07:12.139> so<00:07:12.889> that<00:07:12.919> we<00:07:13.040> can<00:07:13.190> get<00:07:13.310> similar

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
the mouth so that we can get similar

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.139 
the mouth so that we can get similar
edge<00:07:14.000> loop<00:07:14.240> functionality<00:07:14.930> built
