00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.900
 [Music] 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.349
 it was a great vision party today in your 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.150
 back to the monumental the people asked for 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.789
 you and well finally river got the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.470
 classify the rooms as you are 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.330
 Well, the most important thing is that 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.330
 we could achieve the classification that was 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.860
 what we had waiting beyond 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.510
 how good in the first game can not 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.010
 be the colleagues who have a 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.750
 opportunity to be answered from a 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.670
 good way since we do not have a great 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.829
 visitor result and good 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.379
 last processed by purifying us with 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.940
 let's say them with the three points and with the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.309
 partial of the next round in the cup 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.780
 cost the recovery as it exists for 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.059
 to be able to get ahead and good to be able to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.440
 get ready to play this game 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.069
 if it 's always difficult because when 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 come injuries or o that one 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.409
 it's up to stop one or two games you lose 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.550
 a little the rhythm of the parties but 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.350
 we did a good job with the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.989
 kinesiologists and a job 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.309
 recovery we hope will stay ahead 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.780
 do not suffer more injuries and we can 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.280
 have an order towards the end of turn 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.110
 ramÃ³n said that one of the pillars 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.760
 main this equipment is the sacrifice 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
 do you think that's the way 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.580
 and the truth is that they are very much a team that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.730
 try to give the best for all 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.050
 minutes of play in all matches 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.310
 we know that in some moments we are 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.290
 complicated to develop the game that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.800
 we're used to and that's why we try 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.750
 to equate the forces running and 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.310
 putting that is also part of the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.050
 football last and also in a 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.460
 when you left you for alante you 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.630
 you went to attack you do not have problems 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 in playing in any position of the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.519
 court 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.519
 [Applause] 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.930
 I had two or three times that I had the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.820
 opportunity to go forward more than 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.520
 everything to open up the spaces 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.230
 because when a defender breaks the line 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.790
 of the ruffles with dominated ball is 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.710
 loses reference to the brands of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.290
 then it was more true to try 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.120
 do that and also so as not to lose 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.860
 the ball and to not make me so easy to 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.110
 the balls good then to rest 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.940
 for what's coming if you 're going to rest and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.920
 thinking about the match of the weekend 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.229
 which is a very important game 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.229
