00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.639
 with you Dmitri kolesnikov 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.459
 and the survival academy being in nature 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.180
 in the fresh air in a hike or on 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.870
 walk 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.270
 especially when you have no equipment 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.380
 automatically take the habit 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.470
 collect items and things that 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 useful to you when a fire in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.430
 extreme situation along the river banks 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.370
 you can always find awards which 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.440
 will help the product also for 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.469
 kindling a fire 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.350
 we will need labor in this quality 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:51.370
 very good to use dry old 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.269
 bird nests with their help very well 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.269
 spread the fire 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:06.420
 dry grass is also an ideal source 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.420
 making fire 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.979
 birch bark from here this very dry 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.270
 which peels off 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:25.360
 and will give fire from a small spark 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 so what we have in stock and equipment 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.789
 we have no matches but you found on the river 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.619
 stone in the forest we found an old bird's 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:43.569
 nest and forced this nest 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:47.440
 bark dry grass and moss still with us 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.240
 there is a presence of a small multitool set 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.840
 tools with pliers 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 so my multitool miraculously turned out 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 file 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.270
 which we will use with that 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.090
 The goal is that we have this file bun 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.020
 strike at the kremlin with that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.280
 strike a spark 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.280
 now we will demonstrate it 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.700
 so we made a matchless fire with you 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.379
 was Dmitri kolesnikov 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.379
 and the survival academy
