00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
little bit but so one of the methods

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
little bit but so one of the methods
that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.280> used<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> obviously<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that I used which is obviously the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.950 
that I used which is obviously the
friend<00:00:37.050> safari<00:00:37.399> chaining<00:00:38.399> method<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.690> walk

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
friend safari chaining method just walk

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
friend safari chaining method just walk
around<00:00:40.430> until<00:00:41.430> eventually<00:00:41.760> shiny<00:00:42.450> appears

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
around until eventually shiny appears

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
around until eventually shiny appears
and<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:46.430> was<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.789> off<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:49.160> facts<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and so I was going off of facts when I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
and so I was going off of facts when I
read<00:00:50.700> off<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.270> form<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.059> said<00:00:54.420> it's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
read off of a form and it said it's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.650 
read off of a form and it said it's
possible<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> every<00:00:56.640> 600<00:00:57.300> Pokemon

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
possible that one in every 600 Pokemon

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
possible that one in every 600 Pokemon
in<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.320> safari<00:00:58.710> could<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.250> shiny<00:00:59.550> well<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
in this on safari could be shiny well I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.579 
in this on safari could be shiny well I
wanted<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.190> follow-up<00:01:02.579> video

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
wanted to make this follow-up video

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.130 
wanted to make this follow-up video
after<00:01:04.589> encountering<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.369> shiny<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.570> sort<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
after encountering a shiny to sort of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010 
after encountering a shiny to sort of
correct<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> information<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.840> has

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
correct the information that I has

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
correct the information that I has
received<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.869> quite<00:01:13.380> possible<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
received so it is quite possible that it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
received so it is quite possible that it
could<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.970> every<00:01:15.090> thousand<00:01:15.750> 01<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
could be one in every thousand 01 in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.700 
could be one in every thousand 01 in
every<00:01:16.770> step<00:01:17.360> 1200<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> meet<00:01:19.110> because

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
every step 1200 that you meet because

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.179 
every step 1200 that you meet because
this<00:01:20.310> particular<00:01:20.729> journey<00:01:21.299> took<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:22.189> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this particular journey took me I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
this particular journey took me I
believe<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> chain<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:25.310> 826<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.049> this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
believe it was a chain of 826 so this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
believe it was a chain of 826 so this
one<00:01:28.680> took<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> bit<00:01:29.729> longer<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.659> catch<00:01:30.840> than

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
one took me a bit longer to catch than

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
one took me a bit longer to catch than
any<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> other<00:01:31.740> ones<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> i<00:01:32.100> found<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
any of the other ones that i found the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.399 
any of the other ones that i found the
longest<00:01:34.200> took<00:01:34.409> me<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> find<00:01:35.630> any<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:37.170> my

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
longest took me to find any of my

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
longest took me to find any of my
previous<00:01:37.680> ones<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.909> 408<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.930> just

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
previous ones was about 408 so I just

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
previous ones was about 408 so I just
wanted<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> follow-up<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
wanted to make a follow-up and so I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.569 
wanted to make a follow-up and so I
guess<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.619> first<00:01:46.920> live-action<00:01:48.200> shiny

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
guess this is my first live-action shiny

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.600 
guess this is my first live-action shiny
encounter<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.259> um<00:01:52.259> let's<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.460> can

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
encounter so um let's see if we can

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
encounter so um let's see if we can
catch<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.930> fact<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.439> they

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
catch this I know for a fact that they

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.679 
catch this I know for a fact that they
learn<00:01:56.280> whirlwind<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:58.579> because<00:01:59.579> i<00:01:59.969> believe

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
learn whirlwind so because i believe

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.630 
learn whirlwind so because i believe
flexion<00:02:01.259> capability<00:02:01.860> keeps<00:02:02.100> your<00:02:02.250> pokemon

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
flexion capability keeps your pokemon

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
flexion capability keeps your pokemon
from<00:02:02.969> being<00:02:03.390> switched<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.170> through

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
from being switched out through

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.670 
from being switched out through
whirlwind<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.869> i'm<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> send<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.530> my

machete pokemon that I wanted because I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.710 
machete pokemon that I wanted because I
know<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:07.459> octillery<00:03:08.030> was<00:03:08.329> one<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.599> I<00:03:08.659> really

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720

video<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.709> showed<00:03:13.220> pumpkaboo<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.959> was<00:03:15.079> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
video I showed pumpkaboo that was the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.130 
video I showed pumpkaboo that was the
first<00:03:15.470> real<00:03:15.709> shiny<00:03:16.010> from<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.840> in<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> new

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
first real shiny from this in the new

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.940 
first real shiny from this in the new
region<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.040> i<00:03:19.069> extremely<00:03:19.459> wanted<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.950> it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
region that i extremely wanted so it's

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.569 
region that i extremely wanted so it's
super<00:03:22.310> happy<00:03:22.519> when<00:03:22.819> i<00:03:22.849> received<00:03:23.299> pumpkaboo

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
super happy when i received pumpkaboo

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.699 
super happy when i received pumpkaboo
now<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.819> EV<00:03:26.329> trained<00:03:26.659> by<00:03:26.840> artillery<00:03:27.200> for

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
now I EV trained by artillery for

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.140 
now I EV trained by artillery for
special<00:03:28.069> defense<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.579> think<00:03:28.879> this<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.030> probably

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
special defense I think this is probably

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.750 
special defense I think this is probably
the<00:03:29.540> best<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.290> actually<00:03:31.190> go<00:03:31.370> into<00:03:31.549> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the best that actually go into the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:43.860 
the best that actually go into the
saddle<00:03:32.030> with<00:03:32.299> oops<00:03:34.659> one<00:03:35.859> two<00:03:36.859> three<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.940> cool

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.470 

yes<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.049> was<00:03:45.200> right<00:03:45.409> suction<00:03:45.859> cups<00:03:46.150> protects<00:03:47.150> me

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
yes I was right suction cups protects me

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.259 
yes I was right suction cups protects me
from<00:03:47.510> being<00:03:47.959> blown<00:03:48.139> away<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.700> no<00:03:49.700> chance<00:03:49.970> for

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
from being blown away so no chance for

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.300 
from being blown away so no chance for
this<00:03:50.450> should<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.319> need<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:51.739> away<00:03:51.859> from<00:03:52.010> me

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
this should I need to get away from me

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.759 
this should I need to get away from me
for<00:03:52.819> long<00:03:52.849> as<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.120> keep<00:03:53.329> octillery<00:03:54.170> alive<00:03:56.769> once

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
for long as I keep octillery alive once

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.409 
for long as I keep octillery alive once
oh<00:03:58.010> do<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.790> shake<00:03:59.269> that's<00:03:59.870> a<00:04:01.419> little

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
oh do you shake that's a little

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.310 
oh do you shake that's a little
depressing

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.110 

so<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.720> good<00:04:09.170> point<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.830> try<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.700> b-train

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
so so good point to try and a b-train

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.260 
so so good point to try and a b-train
all<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.540> pokemon<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.760> plan<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:14.000> using

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
all the pokemon that you plan on using

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.710 
all the pokemon that you plan on using
in<00:04:15.020> any<00:04:15.380> situation<00:04:16.130> because<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:17.000> EV<00:04:17.330> trained<00:04:17.600> my

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
in any situation because I EV trained my

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.490 
in any situation because I EV trained my
auxiliary<00:04:18.110> doing<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.070> super<00:04:19.220> training<00:04:19.610> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
auxiliary doing the super training and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.520 
auxiliary doing the super training and
since<00:04:21.500> doing<00:04:21.770> it<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:23.240> probably<00:04:23.570> one<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.290> my

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
since doing it it's probably one of my

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.610 
since doing it it's probably one of my
best<00:04:25.600> special<00:04:26.600> defense<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.260> special

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
best special defense and special

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.970 
best special defense and special
attackers<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:31.270> plus<00:04:32.590> octillery<00:04:33.590> is<00:04:33.710> one<00:04:33.860> of

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
attackers so plus octillery is one of

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.530 
attackers so plus octillery is one of
those<00:04:34.100> book<00:04:34.310> moment<00:04:34.700> learns<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.240> bunch<00:04:35.450> of

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
those book moment learns a bunch of

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.150 
those book moment learns a bunch of
different<00:04:35.630> moves<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:37.060> one<00:04:38.200> two<00:04:39.580> three<00:04:42.160> there

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
different moves so one two three there

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.830 
different moves so one two three there
we<00:04:43.250> go<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:45.620> my<00:04:45.860> first<00:04:46.160> live-action<00:04:46.570> capture<00:04:47.570> of

we go so my first live-action capture of

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.630 
we go so my first live-action capture of
