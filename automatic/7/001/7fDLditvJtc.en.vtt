 hello everyone i'm paolo and this is a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.570
 small video short enough for 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.139
 show you how it will be possible 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 delete those pop ups if those 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.050
 advertisements that continue to appear 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.350
 on your computer just like 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.449
 being able to eliminate them through one 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.160
 very small application that we can 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.219
 install inside the voodoo chrome 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 not from the media point of view, especially 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.320
 if especially if you pass a lot 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 time on the internet by opening many 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.760
 pages and following direct and several links 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.640
 within the site 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.780
 some advertising some pop ups is 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 almost impossible to avoid 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 however there are some small gods 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 small apps like the ones I got 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.090
 I'm waiting now for them to help us 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 to eliminate or at least to limit 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.869
 let's say the problem of pop ups to do 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 other than going to your web browser 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.970
 chrome has precisely click on this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 icon here with literals nothing to go up 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.460
 tools and click on extensions 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.369
 then you don't have to do anything else 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.280
 go down, click try others 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:39.549
 extensions the search type 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.950
 simply simple to the application 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:48.350
 what interests us is this the fourth here 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 starting from the top click on free e 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.560
 click on add perfect as 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.549
 you can see here top right is 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.770
 this is the icon we say it tells us 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.479
 which is the application has been installed 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 successfully within ours 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.870
 browser and it's all here and that's all 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.720
 if you have any problems with the visionary 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.019
 for example some videos and you don't have to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.380
 do nothing but click on this one 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.410
 there should be maybe this though 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.790
 application could block us 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.560
 some videos that we say are considered 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.659
 to be a spa but precisely 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.030
 from the application and within the 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.569
 our browser 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.730
 click on the icon click on 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:51.340
 chernoff simple ad hoc and had to same 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:56.260
 report click again and much 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.290
 simple and should also work for 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.739

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.230
