00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.849
 of this channel this time we have 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.590
 camera reviews of the galaxy great max 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.210
 you are going to know their functions and you are going to see 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 that brings practically the same as the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 galaxy grand prime then the interface 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 as always button to exchange 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.029
 between front camera and rear camera 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.670
 button to activate disable or put in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 automatic flash button configuration 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 that already has some generations 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 we are although they are simplifying it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 more access to more configurations 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 resolution effects and more things we're going 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 to see right here on this side button 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.190
 to start recording the video and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 like good samsung you can take pictures 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 while you are recording video to use 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.600
 the video or stop it after the button 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.969
 to take the picture a button to access 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
 to the modes to the list of modes that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.670
 we have here and ready as you see here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.940
 up was the icon to indicate me 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.170
 automatic capture is activated 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.640
 let's deactivate it because if not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 while I'm talking then it's 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 taking pictures and now we are going to start 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.369
 to see 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.289
 the list of modes then we go here and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.259
 let's start with facial beauty this 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.179
 obviously will fade from the face 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.619
 but it has a selector here that both 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.000
 You want me to change your face 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.859
 example how much do you want me to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 Blur that where do you want to get 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.490
 lose weight or enlarge your eyes 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.649
 now we see it clearer in the camera 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 front let's go to another mode that is the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.789
 panoramic this as always is 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.299
 good enough let's put that 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.560
 take a small picture here as well and what 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.990
 I like it, you can stop it in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.810
 any time but process fast and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.239
 you have it with a resolution let's say not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.789
 very good but acceptable let's put 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:47.340
 back and let's go the next way now 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.170
 we have the posterior fit this is a way 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 I really do not think anyone uses 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.879
 in all his life but he comes here you put 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 the box where you want to appear by 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.659
 example I say I want to appear here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.969
 then you go on the other side and you 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.950
 you try to stop and try to put your face 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.770
 here smiling so that the cell phone the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 detect and take the picture then I do not think 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.860
 that serves nothing in that way 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 honestly they should not put it anymore 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.850
 we have the continuous capture this is going 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
 to allow to leave 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.710
 all the button and start to capture up 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.990
 30 photos but not so quickly 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.630
 we are going to press the button and we are going now to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.210
 the hdr and as you see in all these modes 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.830
 the camera like that cut out this because 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.390
 change the resolution of the photograph to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.630
 8 megapixels 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.240
 then in hdr let's take it you take 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.490
 a time to process and we have the 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.800
 result as you see during the time that 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.050
 it says processing does not matter if you move the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.730
 camera already really does not matter anymore 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.100
 I thought you had to have it fixed 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 while saying processing but we're not going 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.360
 now with the night mode obviously 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.090
 when there is not enough light it is very 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 comfortable using a night mode so that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.400
 catch more light then we have the gif 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.040
 animated that is an easy way is supposed 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 to make an animation you leave pressed 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.930
 and you can make a move and then 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.940
 will start to capture it and here you can 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.980
 put what speed you want me to go and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.540
 what quality do you want me to have then 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.880
 It's fine too if you want if you like it 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.530
 create gif because it's pretty good here 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 the list of modes is finished and you can not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.069
 download more let's go to automatic and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.739
 let's exchange the camera 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.510
 the front and as you see has the gesture with 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.760
 the hand to take the photo with the hand 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.519
 there it is that easy 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.069
 you take the picture we have then here this 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.340
 facial beauty selector look how 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.500
 I can smudge the face, touch the face 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.629
 he says and like he already blurs me a little 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.810
 here my expressions after we have 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:42.150
 to lose weight more then how do you see there 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 He made my face very thin and as you see 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.829
 sometimes it detects me and sometimes not and already 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.599
 I have my face all thin and crushed 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.459
 and I can make the eyes still 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.219
 look bigger then she sees me 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.469
 like a distorted alien but 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.439
 good to women they might be interested 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.030
 this type of function is what 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.370
 we found in the front camera and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.379
 we also find the wide selphy and already 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.829
 same to do the self and wide gif 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.600
 it is basically the same as a 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.870
 panoramic you just do this 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.490
 this was not going to come out my finger but it's for 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.640
 take from a self and with a group of 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.560
 bigger friends and that you can do that 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.990
 more people appear in the photo as 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.780
 you see there came out more of the cell more of the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.950
 bookseller and my finger that was clogging 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.620
 then that is all 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.720
 let's go back to the automatic menu to 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.580
 the rear camera first mode 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.560
 automatic and in the configuration we are going to 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.810
 find the list of effects that you can 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.000
 make a timer you can select 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
 the white balance also what 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.390
 do you want me to do the volume key 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.010
 then like any good camera 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.590
 samsung has many things for 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.110
 customize some modes and that's it 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.640
 with respect to the galaxy's great camera 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.220
 max and I hope you liked this 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.930
 video and see you next the first thing 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.510
 as always screenshot a 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.830
 basic in all samsung is letting 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.770
 pressed the on / off button 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.290
 and the home button we leave them pressed 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.290
 and ready the capture is made
