00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
from Panasonic it uses a Leica lens and

from Panasonic it uses a Leica lens and
it's<00:00:25.000> got<00:00:25.149> some<00:00:25.329> great<00:00:25.419> features<00:00:25.829> like<00:00:26.829> a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
for HD video recording and that sort of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.479 
for HD video recording and that sort of
thing<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.469> really<00:00:35.829> nice<00:00:35.890> camera<00:00:36.160> I've<00:00:36.370> had

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
thing it's a really nice camera I've had

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.040 
thing it's a really nice camera I've had
a<00:00:36.520> lot<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.760> fun<00:00:37.030> using<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.390> but<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.660> does<00:00:37.810> have

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
a lot of fun using it but it does have

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.810 
a lot of fun using it but it does have
two<00:00:38.590> problems<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.250> wanted<00:00:39.490> to<00:00:39.580> point<00:00:39.700> out

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
two problems that I wanted to point out

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.900 
two problems that I wanted to point out
here<00:00:39.970> on<00:00:40.060> video<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.800> here<00:00:42.310> goes<00:00:42.460> with<00:00:42.670> number

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
here on video so here goes with number

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.830 
here on video so here goes with number
one<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.270> it's<00:00:44.050> at<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.350> zoom<00:00:45.840> adjustment

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
one and it's at the zoom adjustment

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.069 
one and it's at the zoom adjustment
right<00:00:46.930> here<00:00:47.580> trying<00:00:48.580> to<00:00:48.700> focus<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.240> tends<00:00:49.990> to

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
right here trying to focus that tends to

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.790 
right here trying to focus that tends to
get<00:00:50.200> stuck<00:00:50.490> so<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.610> cameras<00:00:51.910> on<00:00:52.060> and<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:53.710> at

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
get stuck so the cameras on and look at

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.729 
get stuck so the cameras on and look at
that<00:00:53.950> stuck<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.750> camera<00:00:59.079> is<00:00:59.320> relatively

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
that stuck and this camera is relatively

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.860 
that stuck and this camera is relatively
new<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.190> it's<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.730> you<00:01:01.180> know<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.510> hasn't<00:01:01.690> been

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
new and it's in you know it hasn't been

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.920 
new and it's in you know it hasn't been
mishandled<00:01:02.290> at<00:01:02.739> all<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:04.180> want<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.570> zoom<00:01:04.689> in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
mishandled at all but I want to zoom in

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.260 
mishandled at all but I want to zoom in
and<00:01:05.110> -<00:01:05.979> popping<00:01:06.490> back<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:07.780> should<00:01:09.270> get

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
and - popping back like it should get

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.050 
and - popping back like it should get
stuck<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.900> just<00:01:11.890> using<00:01:12.190> one<00:01:12.340> finger<00:01:12.550> not

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
stuck and just using one finger not

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.830 
stuck and just using one finger not
forcing<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.300> that's<00:01:16.300> pretty<00:01:16.420> annoying

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.539 

and<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.649> really<00:01:21.829> doesn't<00:01:22.130> seem<00:01:22.280> like<00:01:22.430> there's

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
and it really doesn't seem like there's

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.330 
and it really doesn't seem like there's
any<00:01:22.670> reason<00:01:23.000> they<00:01:23.090> should<00:01:23.270> do<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:25.100> that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
any reason they should do that it that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.109 
any reason they should do that it that
it<00:01:25.490> should<00:01:25.640> do<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.840> could<00:01:26.990> see<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:27.439> just

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
it should do that you could see it just

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.039 
it should do that you could see it just
sometimes<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.240> get<00:01:29.299> stuck<00:01:29.450> sometimes<00:01:29.960> it

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
sometimes you get stuck sometimes it

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.859 
sometimes you get stuck sometimes it
doesn't<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.329> it's<00:01:32.479> quite<00:01:32.600> annoying

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
doesn't what it is it's quite annoying

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.810 
doesn't what it is it's quite annoying
the<00:01:33.590> other<00:01:33.740> problem<00:01:34.039> is<00:01:34.159> with<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.579> mode<00:01:34.789> dial

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the other problem is with the mode dial

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.480 
the other problem is with the mode dial
right<00:01:35.270> here<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.659> it's<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.289> it's<00:01:37.189> really

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
right here and it's that it's really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.060 
right here and it's that it's really
easy<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.880> shift<00:01:38.299> from<00:01:38.509> mode<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.960> mode<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.920> go

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
easy to shift from mode to mode so go

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.359 
easy to shift from mode to mode so go
from<00:01:40.369> normal<00:01:40.970> Auto<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.259> intelligent<00:01:42.950> Auto<00:01:43.070> and

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
from normal Auto to intelligent Auto and

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.690 
from normal Auto to intelligent Auto and
it<00:01:43.429> takes<00:01:43.990> very<00:01:44.990> little<00:01:45.170> force<00:01:45.590> which<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:46.549> off

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it takes very little force which is off

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.950 
it takes very little force which is off
which<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.119> fine<00:01:47.299> you're<00:01:47.509> gonna<00:01:47.600> be<00:01:47.720> doing<00:01:47.869> with

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
which is fine you're gonna be doing with

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.910 
which is fine you're gonna be doing with
a<00:01:48.049> single<00:01:48.350> finger<00:01:49.720> but<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.110> problem<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:51.679> that

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
a single finger but the problem is that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.169 
a single finger but the problem is that
there's<00:01:52.700> not

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
there's not

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.149 
there's not
they<00:01:53.270> don't<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.600> hard<00:01:53.899> stops<00:01:54.310> over<00:01:55.310> here<00:01:55.700> or

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
they don't have hard stops over here or

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.699 
they don't have hard stops over here or
over<00:01:58.159> here<00:01:58.190> which<00:01:58.819> means<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.270> could<00:01:59.420> spin<00:01:59.810> out

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
over here which means you could spin out

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.789 
over here which means you could spin out
of<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.250> mode<00:02:01.549> area<00:02:02.240> into<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> dead<00:02:03.530> space

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
of this mode area into a dead space

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.969 
of this mode area into a dead space
which<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.490> 50%<00:02:04.819> of<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.149> dial<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.530> when<00:02:06.830> you're

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
which is 50% of the dial and when you're

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.449 
which is 50% of the dial and when you're
in<00:02:07.039> that<00:02:07.159> dead<00:02:07.340> space<00:02:08.530> mode<00:02:09.530> dial<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.310> in

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
in that dead space mode dial is not in

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:20.490 
in that dead space mode dial is not in
the<00:02:10.549> proper<00:02:10.789> position<00:02:11.299> and<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.750> can't<00:02:12.019> shoot

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.750 

so<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.130> go<00:02:21.280> back<00:02:21.870> everything's<00:02:22.870> good<00:02:23.020> again

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
so you go back everything's good again

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.990 
so you go back everything's good again
you<00:02:24.760> move<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.240> little<00:02:25.600> bit<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.840> force<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you move it a little bit of force a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.470 
you move it a little bit of force a
millimeter<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:29.400> yeah<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.820> we'll<00:02:31.000> do<00:02:31.120> both<00:02:31.300> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
millimeter and yeah so we'll do both the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.300 
millimeter and yeah so we'll do both the
same<00:02:31.690> time<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.050> can<00:02:32.200> see<00:02:32.410> it
