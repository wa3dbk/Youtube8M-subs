00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.160
 after specifying another visit to the center 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.960
 educational environmental passes already with the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 money available to start the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.670
 process of obtaining the title of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 nursing we go to the place where 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.490
 would begin the process however the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.980
 professor gloria was not in the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.679
 place when we think the process is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.869
 would lengthen before this setback a person 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.109
 calls us again to redouble the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.720
 bet we were not willing to 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 wait until November or go through 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.760
 the stress of having to perform 48 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.130
 matters because in that scenario it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.170
 opened the possibility of some error that 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.640
 could delay that we reach this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 goal 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 that's why the conversation with Carlos 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 sovereign opens us such a broad panorama 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.940
 as interesting 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 Clear 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.259
 so I do not want me to point you higher 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.830
 success the title says working I need 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.820
 they include you from 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 and the nursing title 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:30.790
 and with the comic stop for we won 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.440
 and improved 3 of the title 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.330
 and I mentioned it 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.330
 in a four-year class 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.580
 of pills 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.580
 yes 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.670
 I have, I'm not going to pay you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.090
 I need I sold my house 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 and I have money I have the same 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 8,800 of chrysolite those things 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.990
 but I do not have I am from 89 10 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.500
 million 980 the anxiety crisis 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.820
 the years in which surely that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.260
 knowledge of experience in 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.980
 question with each other 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.980
 but one 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.799
 this 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.799
 they need 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.340
 but 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 Hello 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.480
 no no 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.000
 and let's go 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 [Music] 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.660
 yes 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.430
 no way 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430
 ah 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.500
 hiding the sign of the traces 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.500
 tickets 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 then 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.379
 Hello 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.379
 no way 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.870
 the score or they do not take it in their life 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.870
 to the normalization of the fact 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.270
 yes 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.280
 so 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.160
 maybe not 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.580
 and has relied on our new know 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.580
 that our 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.440
 and then we tell him he said 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.769
 that at the end of the course it does not matter 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.530
 when 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.990
 that needs its beginnings and will take 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.990
 all the classes 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:32.320
 Thank you 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.790
 and especially because having 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.430
 in the heart 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.160
 we'll see 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.800
 and the more and the more the total of 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.320
 800 complete only that you have to 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 depend need 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.490

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.200
 Question 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.750
 It depends 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.750
 [Applause] 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.449
 the issue is that I 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.120
 you have to give us 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.509
 yes 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.950
 October I think there is a 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.950
 that break does not like anything 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.380
 ah 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.620
