00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.670
 warning this video is not about 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.410
 explain ways to destroy beings 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.360
 human or animals of any kind 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.369
 neither is it intended to incite anyone to 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.740
 destroy the planet are only video 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:15.940
 informative about hypothetical forms of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.940
 that the world comes to an end 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.960
 collision against a giant black hole 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.590
 if somehow something somebody was 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.170
 able to drag the earth in the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.480
 direction of a giant black hole 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 that is not far away in about 500 years 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.570
 of travel we could face the earth 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.460
 to a clear chaotic and unpleasant ending 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.010
 that the technology needed to achieve 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.350
 we would not have this until inside 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.320
 about a thousand years but in the distant future 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.480
 if it could be achieved it would be very difficult 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.980
 but not impossible 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.140
 when the earth is in 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.970
 vicinity of the black hole and fall 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
 towards him the back would be 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 practically impossible and once the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.480
 earth plus the horizon events of the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280
 black hole the result would be 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.860
 similar to throwing a wooden house 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 against a category 5 tornado 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.050
 explosion by a matter reaction 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.050
 antimatter 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.859
 it is known that antimatter is the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 most explosive substance that can be 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.270
 manufacture in a particle accelerator 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.840
 that's why some are building 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 bombs of this type so that I do not end 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.759
 I want to imagine what country does not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.969
 I need to say it and you can 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.630
 suppose but how much antimatter would 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.460
 lack 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.469
 according to the calculations that have been made 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.480
 it would take a bomb that was so 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.940
 large that will weigh 2500 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.850
 millions of tons something almost 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.710
 impossible with current technology that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.990
 assuming zero loss of energy 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.380
 by heat and radiation what is little 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.660
 probable in reality probably 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.610
 you need 10 times that amount when 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.170
 everything is ready, you just have to crash 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.210
 the against the earth the planet 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 it would explode into pieces, 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.069
 energy that the sun gives off in a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 week 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.250
 divert an asteroid to earth 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.590
 this technology would be feasible within 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.959
 a few years but to drag a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.550
 asteroid that is big enough 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.069
 to destroy the earth in a way 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.930
 explosive we would need such a body 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.599
 big as the moon and throw it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.480
 strongly against the earth and more or 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.000
 less would have to have half of the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.640
 speed of light and this is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.769
 practically impossible at present 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.060
 maybe in a thousand years there would be 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.550
 said probability 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.739
 with an impact of such magnitudes the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.489
 land as we know it would come 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.500
 to its end 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.830
 only large chunks of 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.470
 rock roaming the space 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.780
 that a little sun like nemesis hits 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.819
 against the earth 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 there is a lot of talk about the hypothesis 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.990
 nemesis course which would form a system 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.970
 binary with ours and that would orbit 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.560
 in the outer part of the solar system 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.420
 next to the order cloud 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.489
 many scientists believe in the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.380
 possibility that there is this second 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.349
 sun and believe that is the cause of that 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.090
 every 25,000 years a comet is directed to 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.209
 the earth from the outside of the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.250
 solar system if somehow from 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.680
 that a comet suddenly appeared 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 will present nemesis and go straight to the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.840
 earth would only pray would be much 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.069
 worse than throwing to the ground against 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.890
 little jupiter would be left of it 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.290
 absorbed by a black hole created 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.209
 accidentally 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 it is known that there is an accelerator 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.959
 particles could be created by accident 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.890
 a black hole and this in the future 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.180
 it would be a fairly likely matter 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.609
 assuming that in the future we have a 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.470
 giant particle accelerator that is 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.509
 able to create a black hole by 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.850
 accident large enough 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.190
 while the black hole has matter 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.310
 from which to feed the following would be 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.139
 a catastrophic chain reaction the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.240
 black hole would sink into the earth 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.610
 until you reach the other side of the planet and 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.400
 would return again while absorbing 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.919
 matter and pulverize everything as if it were throwing 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.389
 a grape to a blender 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.699
 as the black hole grows 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.470
 it slows down and gets closer 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.139
 to the center of the earth and so 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 successively until there is no more 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.940
 land at the end would be a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.030
 smallest singularity a ball of 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.919
 golf orbiting the sun and surely 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.759
 would disappear over time by the 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.759
 hawking radiation 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.740
 thank you very much for watching another video that 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.740
 go through the unknown
