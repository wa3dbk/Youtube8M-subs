00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
destroying the boxes a little bit and I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
destroying the boxes a little bit and I
just<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> put<00:01:32.790> less<00:01:33.000> pressure<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.360> the

just want to put less pressure on the
box<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:35.689> six-foot<00:01:36.689> shelf<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> my

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
box so it's a six-foot shelf and my

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
box so it's a six-foot shelf and my
ceiling<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:39.600> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> low<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
ceiling is obviously kind of low is my I

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.219

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
I don't have to have this over here I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.300 
I don't have to have this over here I
could<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.440> move<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:43.919> one<00:03:44.040> over<00:03:44.099> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
could have just to move this one over a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.469 
could have just to move this one over a
little<00:03:44.430> bit<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.669> then<00:03:44.729> have<00:03:44.940> two<00:03:45.180> shelves

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
little bit and then have two shelves

side<00:03:45.810> by<00:03:45.930> side<00:03:46.169> I<00:03:46.409> think<00:03:46.709> that'd<00:03:46.829> be<00:03:46.949> a<00:03:46.979> really

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
side by side I think that'd be a really

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.129 
side by side I think that'd be a really
good<00:03:47.280> look<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.760> um<00:03:48.030> yeah<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.810> guys<00:03:48.959> use

good look so um yeah you guys use

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.530 
good look so um yeah you guys use
shelves<00:03:49.590> um<00:03:50.370> or<00:03:50.819> do<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.060> stack<00:03:51.389> your

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
shelves um or do you just stack your

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.149 
shelves um or do you just stack your
boxes<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.989> mean<00:03:52.139> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> ton<00:03:52.859> of<00:03:52.889> kicks
