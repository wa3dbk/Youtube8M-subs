00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
that i divided my hair into to detangle

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.670 
that i divided my hair into to detangle
and<00:02:04.400> like<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:05.030> said<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.360> was<00:02:05.480> way<00:02:05.840> less<00:02:06.140> time<00:02:06.470> it

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
and like I said it was way less time it

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.550 
and like I said it was way less time it
was<00:02:06.830> weight<00:02:07.100> easier<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.180> it<00:02:09.110> was<00:02:09.230> less

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
was weight easier and it was less

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
was weight easier and it was less
shedding<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.520> use<00:02:11.300> less<00:02:11.600> product<00:02:12.130> because<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.370> i

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
shedding I use less product because I i

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.520 
shedding I use less product because I i
usually<00:02:14.000> use<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.150> whole<00:02:14.390> body<00:02:14.570> hook<00:02:14.750> vo5<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.500> I
