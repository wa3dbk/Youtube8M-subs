00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.920
 all right 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 and very good and here we are again in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 creams for inmates a super map 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.250
 superchulo made with like in blogs in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
 minecraft 1.8 I'm playing the 1.8 point 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 one simply by bus arrangement and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.310
 well you can play pokemon inside 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 minecraft really is not pokemon do not go 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.220
 to get out the pokemon inside minecraft 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.770
 but you can use the mods of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 pokemon to play pokemon is a 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.220
 bestiality is only a concept 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 we can only play in this park 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.940
 cited that we have just here behind 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.920
 but it is a chulada I think it will be 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.480
 great and when they expand it to a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 universe is not a pokemon map by 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 example that there is a lot that's good 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 on the internet then you can play 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.090
 pokemon really inside the minecraft 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 in a very special way because it makes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.020
 lack you do not have baltanÃ¡s simply 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 have minecraft 1.8 and the map and point 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.040
 So, as you can see, this is a 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.320
 world testing the creator of this 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.270
 concept that really is quite 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.430
 cool and apart from all this I'm going to give you 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 to begin play in voucher and we have to give it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
 from here and here is where started more or 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 less where is the pokemon screen 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 fish version of fright feast version of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
 fire red version 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.150
 Well, if we do not come here, we're going 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.250
 to give this little button to start 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 vanilla pokemon proof of concept 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 hello welcome to mini town gravestone where 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.399
 the few minecraft modes have 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 been transformed into creatures that now 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.119
 you can meet like pokemon to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 help you during your time here you can 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.190
 choose one of the three initial pokemon 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 for good then to choose the points 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 which one are you going to choose this case we can 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 choose this one called the well-worth 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.950
 that's a boom here we have this one that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.789
 called the ereim and this one who does not know here 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.710
 but what is a silver fish is called 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.990
 grill bar good well in this case the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.149
 Betis comes out you can choose but not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.580
 it comes out then I'm not going to choose it and we're going 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.429
 to choose the good because it is the one that has 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.080
 chosen the creator of this map in 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.789
 uploaded on youtube me for being for example 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.590
 I have put in the description of the video its 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.880
 video since I think it's a person that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.799
 deserves a lot more subscribers a lot more 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.510
 visits that you have and I think that 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.450
 well then mind a little more support not 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.200
 then give it to 10 and we choose 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.120
 no one 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280
 we have also here we have the points 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 of life that has the good at the moment and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 tells you your adventure because we are going to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 point to start we are on route 3 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.319
 the 9 and 34 the harry potter route is 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 totally done for that so that we 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.280
 remember harry potter and we will give 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.930
 realize that I can not skip it and today 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.430
 it has space and we can not jump because 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.260
 we have several effects that in this case 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.090
 as they are made as the amp 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.290
 directly so we can not get there 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.480
 to jump we can for example upload 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.090
 stairs but we can not jump so 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.959
 if we do not put the basic poop in the water 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.090
 then well let's go to here 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.099
 because when we are in the tall grass 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.920
 As you can see, a combat begins because 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.579
 this case is given me slowly and after 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.769
 some time then I'm going to this screen in 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.950
 what we have the fight is a 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.840
 genius is a genius is that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.730
 I put you up here a carling save 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.230
 that appeared is very cool thing 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.810
 we have four things in which we can 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.930
 to click on the chat it can give 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.700
 backpack to pokemon to run and fight 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.170
 in this case we can not choose or 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.819
 pokemon and backpacks why are you looking 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.980
 because there is nothing made nothing 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.540
 programmed to do it so 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.440
 let's give it to run so you can see 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.480
 we can run away 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.390
 a fight in this case as you see we have 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.250
 climbed well and if we go back again if 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.500
 we continue walking through the tall grass 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.980
 we will find another combat in the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.790
 that in this time then we are going to fight 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.939
 we'll see 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.819
 does not appear catlin the video of the 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.590
 creator came out other pokemon between 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.290
 quotes that would be a was a golem of 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.909
 iron and I do not know what else but in this case 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.469
 I think we have been trying to open 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.359
 combats and it's going to be that they do not come out 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.459
 we have to play with what we have 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.530
 what is this kitty worth we are going to give 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.950
 fight we can choose for example 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.510
 tackle illusion fire black or flame water 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.909
 I am going to give for example this to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.000
 that you see how the attack is fixed what 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.590
 past the flamethrower is a pass and he 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.569
 also because it attacks us in 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.419
 this case has not done anything to us because 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.220
 we have dodged and this is totally at 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.019
 chance is worth then we give it back to 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.110
 fight and in this case we are going to give 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.370
 that which is a plate that is worth as you see 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.919
 makes a tackle and also lowers the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.990
 life the life of the opponent is here 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.280
 it's worth it for those who do not know what good 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.780
 so we get the experience points 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.759
 while the life of another pokemon us 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.720
 it comes out here and for the moment it has not given us 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.419
 one time 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.729
 we now give eruption so that what 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.810
 see also the next attack and 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.820
 then 22 well 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.920
 we have gained 32 experience points in 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.740
 This case, as you can see, will not go up 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.090
 level or anything like that because in the end 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.700
 it's just a concept it's an idea 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.680
 but the same can be done and 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.290
 it may look great guys the truth is 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.870
 which looks very good from here to 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.370
 future to do cool things worth 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.010
 here just now seem behind the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.130
 fence the thing is we can give it now to 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.720
 see fight that we are going to fight we give to 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.730
 fire flash that is the only one that has been 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.380
 left without teaching and as you see 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.150
 Well, here we have all the attacks that 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.330
 we can get to do u and has attacked me 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.460
 come 274 well then a cat that 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.760
 really yes yes that attacks yes that 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.070
 works well then let's try bar 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.660
 It is over because we have charged another 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.340
 point of experience point but this 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.380
 case as you see then nothing happens and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.650
 How are we out of the grass? 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.360
 no opponent will come out 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.070
 then it's pretty cool is not in the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.600
 water in the good I think I get nothing 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.820
 but through the water to see what happens 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.470
 watching the water looks as it does 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.590
 I can leave if not because although I can not 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.040
 jump yes I can go swimming 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.230
 then it is not clear that it does not come out 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.180
 no enemy in the moment sheet 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.580
 but you could do very cool things 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.260
 guys, I think it's a very big idea 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.080
 It is a very cool idea for any 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.850
 map of pokemon adventures and that we 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.050
 it can serve simply as an example 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:09.800
 this good as I'm going to give you here 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.870
 break I came out with game mode 1 I'm going to 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.730
 give him here to turn off the experiment when 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.340
 I was played or when you can not follow 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.140
 so you give this button and so 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.780
 power again jump again and come back 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.120
 to fly and so on and well 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.380
 commands used to make this map 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.300
 Well, it's all these videos over here 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.100
 ok I could not do a tutorial 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.810
 of command blogs better than the one 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.580
 you can do is simply 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.200
 downloading the map that is in the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.060
 video description of these people 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.800
 and things so I leave the link of the 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.210
 description in the description to the video 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.950
 is people and in the video this person 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.720
 Download is the map to give you a 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.120
 little bit of audience a bit to sag al 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.130
 because I think he deserves it and good 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.690
 then you can download the map you can 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.790
 look at the copan blogs you can see how 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.800
 it's done and you can have it a little bit 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.070
 account to make your problem for 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.630
 my 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.030
 from pokemon that I think deserves 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.410
 very much not worth it then here the 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.300
 decision we hope has cost a lot 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.590
 you can press like and favorites not 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.590
 we see in the following video 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.650
 ah 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.650
 see you later
