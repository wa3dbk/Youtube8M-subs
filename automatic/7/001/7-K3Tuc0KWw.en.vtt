00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
what's going on right now is a rocket

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
what's going on right now is a rocket
launcher<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.430> hit<00:01:14.549> kill<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
launcher it's like a one hit kill the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.960 
launcher it's like a one hit kill the
best<00:01:15.330> gun<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> flak

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
best gun I think actually the flak

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
best gun I think actually the flak
cannon<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.479> pretty<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
cannon is pretty good but like this is a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.070 
cannon is pretty good but like this is a
kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> new<00:01:21.180> begun<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.230 

some<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:24.980> said<00:01:26.410> to<00:01:27.410> show<00:01:27.950> different<00:01:28.820> guns

it the crosshair cursor thing whatever

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.949 
it the crosshair cursor thing whatever
you<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.519> call<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.670> moves<00:02:35.120> too<00:02:35.390> fast<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
you want to call it moves too fast and

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.060 
you want to call it moves too fast and
it<00:02:37.000> there<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.120> no<00:02:38.269> small<00:02:38.540> movements<00:02:39.070> it's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
it there are no small movements it's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.259 
it there are no small movements it's
just<00:02:40.310> one<00:02:40.900> very<00:02:41.900> large<00:02:42.640> spike<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.820> time<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
just one very large spike at a time and

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.120 
just one very large spike at a time and
here<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.900> Redeemer<00:02:45.290> it's<00:02:45.890> like<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
here this is the Redeemer it's like a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.600 
here this is the Redeemer it's like a
nuke<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.500> strongest<00:02:49.070> gun<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> game

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
nuke it is the strongest gun in the game

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.280 
nuke it is the strongest gun in the game
I<00:02:49.820> remember<00:02:49.940> using<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.660> wasn't<00:02:50.930> sure<00:02:51.170> how

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
I remember using this I wasn't sure how

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.210 
I remember using this I wasn't sure how
to<00:02:51.380> use<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.739> in<00:02:53.709> honestly<00:02:54.709> gave<00:02:54.860> him<00:02:54.950> killed

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
to use this in honestly gave him killed

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.729 
to use this in honestly gave him killed
anyone<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.780> yeah<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:57.560> know<00:02:57.620> how<00:02:57.709> you

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
anyone but yeah I don't know how you

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.800 
anyone but yeah I don't know how you
using<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.400> game<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:59.120> other<00:02:59.300> games<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.750> know

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
using this game in other games I know

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.660 
using this game in other games I know
you<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.200> another<00:03:00.680> Unreal<00:03:01.190> Tournament<00:03:01.220> ones

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
you can another Unreal Tournament ones

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.540 
you can another Unreal Tournament ones
you<00:03:01.910> can<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:03.769> can<00:03:03.920> actually<00:03:04.040> control<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you can you can actually control the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.150 
you can you can actually control the
missile<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.180> it's<00:03:06.170> basically<00:03:06.440> like<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.920> nuke

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
missile and it's basically like a nuke

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.699 
missile and it's basically like a nuke
it's<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.610> awesome<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.850> yeah<00:03:10.850> back<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
it's so awesome but yeah back to the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.160 
it's so awesome but yeah back to the
crosshair<00:03:12.709> thing<00:03:13.220> whatever<00:03:14.019> it's<00:03:15.019> very

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
crosshair thing whatever it's very

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.820 
crosshair thing whatever it's very
arctic<00:03:15.530> hard<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.920> control<00:03:17.320> basically<00:03:18.320> how<00:03:18.800> I

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
arctic hard to control basically how I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.850 
arctic hard to control basically how I
aim<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.690> by<00:03:20.690> strafing<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:22.790> getting<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
aim is by strafing like getting the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.590 
aim is by strafing like getting the
right<00:03:24.860> analog<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.640> certain<00:03:26.000> level<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.480> then

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
right analog to a certain level and then

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.000 
right analog to a certain level and then
just<00:03:26.780> strafing<00:03:27.080> back<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.530> forth<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
just strafing back and forth and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.920 
just strafing back and forth and
shooting<00:03:28.850> that's<00:03:29.390> what<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:29.630> in<00:03:29.750> call<00:03:29.900> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
shooting that's what I do in call of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.010 
shooting that's what I do in call of
duty<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> don't<00:03:30.650> know

my<00:03:34.020> accuracy<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:35.130> really<00:03:35.640> bad<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.330> I'm<00:03:36.450> still

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
my accuracy is really bad but I'm still

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.460 
my accuracy is really bad but I'm still
a<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:37.260> good<00:03:37.410> player<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.750> I'm<00:03:39.750> not<00:03:40.260> sure<00:03:40.350> how

when<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.880> was<00:04:29.910> actually<00:04:30.240> playing<00:04:30.390> some<00:04:30.570> call<00:04:30.720> of

when I was actually playing some call of
duty<00:04:31.080> earlier<00:04:31.380> today<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.730> was<00:04:32.970> freaking

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
duty earlier today and I was freaking

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.380 
duty earlier today and I was freaking
beasting<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.170> kids<00:04:34.530> with<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.030> m40<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.150> card

beasting on kids with the m40 on card
for<00:04:36.890> now<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.919> think<00:04:38.040> I'm<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.640> pretty<00:04:38.910> good<00:04:39.120> sniper

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
for now I think I'm a pretty good sniper

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.100 
for now I think I'm a pretty good sniper
I<00:04:40.140> think<00:04:40.980> if<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.160> snipe<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:42.120> couple<00:04:43.020> days

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
I think if I snipe for a couple days

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.290 
I think if I snipe for a couple days
straight<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.590> would<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.919> really<00:04:44.250> really<00:04:44.580> good

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
straight I would be really really good

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.070 
straight I would be really really good
and<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:46.110> could<00:04:46.169> get<00:04:46.470> like<00:04:47.240> crazy<00:04:48.240> montage<00:04:48.720> clips

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
and I could get like crazy montage clips

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920 
and I could get like crazy montage clips
or<00:04:49.230> something<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.740> got<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> bunch<00:04:51.360> of<00:04:51.480> nice<00:04:51.660> quick

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
or something I got a bunch of nice quick

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.350 
or something I got a bunch of nice quick
scopes<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.410> stuff<00:04:52.620> it's<00:04:53.160> much<00:04:53.370> easier<00:04:53.880> to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
scopes and stuff it's much easier to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.230 
scopes and stuff it's much easier to
snipe<00:04:54.660> on<00:04:54.810> cod4<00:04:55.640> just<00:04:56.640> because<00:04:56.910> there's<00:04:57.120> no

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
snipe on cod4 just because there's no

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.159 
snipe on cod4 just because there's no
lag<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:59.390> the<00:05:00.390> gun<00:05:01.970> all<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.330> guns<00:05:03.540> they<00:05:03.930> just

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
lag and the gun all the guns they just

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.090 
lag and the gun all the guns they just
feel<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.419> precise<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.500> if<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.620> hit<00:05:07.830> someone

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
feel so precise and if you hit someone

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.750 
feel so precise and if you hit someone
like<00:05:09.169> when<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.200> hit<00:05:10.440> someone<00:05:10.680> in<00:05:10.800> cod4<00:05:11.040> like<00:05:11.610> I

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
like when I hit someone in cod4 like I

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.180 
like when I hit someone in cod4 like I
know<00:05:11.850> they're<00:05:12.210> gonna<00:05:12.270> die<00:05:12.710> modern<00:05:13.710> warfare<00:05:13.890> 2

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
know they're gonna die modern warfare 2

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.670 
know they're gonna die modern warfare 2
i'm<00:05:14.220> never<00:05:14.640> sure<00:05:14.760> as<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.870> never<00:05:16.140> snipe<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:16.590> that

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
i'm never sure as I never snipe in that

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.470 
i'm never sure as I never snipe in that
game<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.190> can't<00:05:18.060> stand<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:19.669> like<00:05:20.669> with<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:20.970> m40

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
game I can't stand it like with the m40

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.740 
game I can't stand it like with the m40
I<00:05:21.510> don't<00:05:21.750> use<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.990> cog<00:05:22.230> I<00:05:22.380> hate<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.680> cog<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:23.750> don't

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
I don't use a cog I hate a cog I don't

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.800 
I don't use a cog I hate a cog I don't
know<00:05:24.810> why<00:05:24.930> people<00:05:24.960> use<00:05:25.350> it<00:05:26.330> but<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.450> regular

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
know why people use it but the regular

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.140 
know why people use it but the regular
scope<00:05:28.080> on<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.350> gun<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.800> just

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
scope on that gun I just

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.090 
scope on that gun I just
when<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.180> hit<00:05:32.390> someone<00:05:32.600> i<00:05:32.720> know<00:05:32.810> i<00:05:33.320> hate<00:05:33.710> them<00:05:33.860> i

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
when I hit someone i know i hate them i

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.660 
when I hit someone i know i hate them i
guess<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.910> lot<00:05:35.540> of<00:05:35.570> hit<00:05:35.750> mark<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.080> still<00:05:36.290> but

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
guess a lot of hit mark is still but

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.980 
guess a lot of hit mark is still but
compared<00:05:37.670> to<00:05:37.700> 10<00:05:38.000> fair<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.570> gun<00:05:38.720> seems

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
compared to 10 fair to the gun seems

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.470 
compared to 10 fair to the gun seems
more<00:05:39.200> powerful<00:05:40.750> just<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.110> call<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.560> guns

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
more powerful just the call the guns

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.480 
more powerful just the call the guns
like<00:05:44.480> it<00:05:44.900> card<00:05:45.260> for<00:05:45.530> such<00:05:45.920> a<00:05:45.950> better<00:05:46.220> game<00:05:46.460> than

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
like it card for such a better game than

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.440 
like it card for such a better game than
motto<00:05:46.850> or<00:05:47.060> fair<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.740> only<00:05:48.920> thing<00:05:49.450> it's

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
motto or fair to the only thing it's

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.570 
motto or fair to the only thing it's
just<00:05:50.630> not<00:05:50.810> as<00:05:50.990> complex<00:05:51.650> as<00:05:51.920> modern<00:05:52.220> warfare<00:05:52.370> 2

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
just not as complex as modern warfare 2

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.940 
just not as complex as modern warfare 2
there's<00:05:52.760> not<00:05:52.880> many<00:05:52.970> things<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.630> can<00:05:54.410> do<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.800> it

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
there's not many things you can do in it

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.800 
there's not many things you can do in it
but<00:05:55.670> i<00:05:55.730> guess<00:05:55.910> that<00:05:56.120> that's<00:05:56.300> what<00:05:56.480> makes<00:05:56.660> the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
but i guess that that's what makes the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.050 
but i guess that that's what makes the
game<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.020> good<00:05:57.500> it's<00:05:57.860> just<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.250> simplicity<00:05:58.550> of

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
game so good it's just the simplicity of

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.780 
game so good it's just the simplicity of
it<00:06:01.480> this<00:06:02.480> game<00:06:02.720> actually<00:06:03.490> reasonable<00:06:04.490> talking

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
it this game actually reasonable talking

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.820 
it this game actually reasonable talking
about<00:06:04.970> this<00:06:05.120> games<00:06:05.420> I<00:06:05.780> don't<00:06:06.560> want<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.770> talk

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
about this games I don't want to talk

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.860 
about this games I don't want to talk
about<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.850> be<00:06:07.970> honest<00:06:08.240> I<00:06:08.390> don't<00:06:08.450> play<00:06:08.750> this

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870
