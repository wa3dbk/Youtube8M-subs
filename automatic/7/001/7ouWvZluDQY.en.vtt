00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
important part is that we go out there

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.839 
important part is that we go out there
and<00:02:02.469> play<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.829> game<00:02:02.859> we<00:02:03.159> play<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.369> game<00:02:03.490> to

was<00:03:35.920> tough<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.250> overcome<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:37.599> one

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
was tough to overcome and that was one

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.030 
was tough to overcome and that was one
of<00:03:37.780> those<00:03:37.930> situations<00:03:38.139> where<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.739> said<00:03:38.950> you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
of those situations where I said you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.020

know<00:03:39.130> I'm<00:03:39.310> going<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.519> take<00:03:39.639> over<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.880> game

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
know I'm going to take over the game

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.599 
know I'm going to take over the game
offensively<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.810> dominate<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:41.290> game<00:03:41.549> but<00:03:42.549> I

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
offensively and dominate this game but I

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.250 
offensively and dominate this game but I
didn't<00:03:42.910> do<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.150> because<00:03:43.299> we<00:03:43.660> knew<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
didn't do that because we knew that the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.720 
didn't do that because we knew that the
strategy<00:03:44.500> was<00:03:44.769> get<00:03:45.010> everybody<00:03:45.370> involved

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
strategy was get everybody involved

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.250 
strategy was get everybody involved
because<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.299> affects<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.690> defensive<00:03:47.169> end

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
because that affects the defensive end

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.050 
because that affects the defensive end
of<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.410> floor<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.220> we<00:03:48.400> did<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:48.760> very<00:03:48.940> well

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
of the floor and we did that very well

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.089 
of the floor and we did that very well
in<00:03:49.329> game<00:03:49.510> 4<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:49.959> fact<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.260> shot<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:51.010> know
