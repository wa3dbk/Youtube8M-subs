six you're still just a golfer nothing
wrong<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> up

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
wrong with that but if you can get it up

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.710 
wrong with that but if you can get it up
there<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.030> hit<00:01:39.150> six<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> nine

and<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.439> reason<00:01:40.740> why<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.310> game<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and the reason why I like this game is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.080 
and the reason why I like this game is
it<00:01:42.600> handles<00:01:43.110> any<00:01:43.380> wind<00:01:43.680> direction<00:01:43.829> any<00:01:44.399> hole

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it handles any wind direction any hole

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.050 
it handles any wind direction any hole
location<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> shot<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.579> thing<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> if

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
location I got a shot in the thing is if

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
location I got a shot in the thing is if
you<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.479> nine<00:01:48.689> shots<00:01:49.020> grooved<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you have these nine shots grooved you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
you have these nine shots grooved you
have<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.640> greenlight<00:01:51.180> shots<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.899> these

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
have more greenlight shots to all these

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
have more greenlight shots to all these
different<00:01:52.259> wind<00:01:52.680> directions<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.369> hole

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
different wind directions and hole

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
different wind directions and hole
locations<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.079> shoot<00:01:55.290> lower<00:01:55.680> shots

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
locations so you can shoot lower shots

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
locations so you can shoot lower shots
and<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> play<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.509> C<00:01:57.719> word<00:01:57.930> right

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and you can play with the C word right

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
and you can play with the C word right
there<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.799> choke<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.270> confidence<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there not choke but with confidence you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.630 
there not choke but with confidence you
can<00:02:01.380> play<00:02:01.680> these<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.979> might<00:02:02.130> find<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
can play these you might find out the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you can hit three out of nine but you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260 
you can hit three out of nine but you
can<00:02:04.320> hit<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> low<00:02:04.770> fade<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.729> straight<00:02:06.090> one

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.920 

if<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.280> see<00:03:49.460> those<00:03:49.610> balls<00:03:50.300> so<00:03:50.630> far<00:03:50.840> I've

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
if you can see those balls so far I've

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.860 
if you can see those balls so far I've
hit<00:03:51.080> six<00:03:51.350> balls<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:53.240> I've<00:03:53.330> hit<00:03:53.510> every<00:03:53.840> shot

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
hit six balls and I've hit every shot

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.620 
hit six balls and I've hit every shot
exactly<00:03:54.260> what<00:03:54.740> I<00:03:54.770> called<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.910> hardest

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
exactly what I called and the hardest

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.710 
exactly what I called and the hardest
one<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:57.460> believe<00:03:58.460> is<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.730> high<00:03:58.880> series<00:03:59.330> because

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
one I believe is the high series because

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.320 
one I believe is the high series because
now<00:04:00.200> you're<00:04:00.380> trying<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.650> hit<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:00.950> high<00:04:01.210> if<00:04:02.210> you

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
now you're trying to hit it high if you

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.240 
now you're trying to hit it high if you
pop<00:04:02.540> your<00:04:02.720> belly<00:04:02.900> out<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:03.380> can<00:04:03.590> hit<00:04:03.710> behind<00:04:03.890> it

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
pop your belly out and can hit behind it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.170 
pop your belly out and can hit behind it
a<00:04:04.310> little<00:04:04.490> so<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.700> need<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.880> good<00:04:05.060> lie<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:08.030> this

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
a little so you need a good lie so this

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.060 
a little so you need a good lie so this
would<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> high<00:04:08.570> straight<00:04:08.900> ball<00:04:09.110> watch<00:04:09.920> how

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
would be a high straight ball watch how

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.440 
would be a high straight ball watch how
high<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.280> follow-through<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:16.180> that's<00:04:17.180> dead

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
high the follow-through is that's dead

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.380 
high the follow-through is that's dead
straight<00:04:17.810> can<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.560> use<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.910> one<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.150> call

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
straight can I use this this one I call

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.440 
straight can I use this this one I call
