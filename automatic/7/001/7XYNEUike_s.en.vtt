00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769
 the problem today of international aid 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.289
 it is both insufficient 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.859
 and fragmented 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.029
 so fragmented because there are some united nations organizations that 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.119
 deals with the question of the feeding of agriculture and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.909
 food aid that his host 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.430
 the parena and faro 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.780
 or the figaro called three years romance 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 and who plays the role then these are big institutions that have some 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.290
 inertia that have running costs that are relatively 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.940
 heavy 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.570
 but who plays the role 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.800
 with them some relevance of their areas of business problems 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.150
 that she does not play it separately 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.160
 and that the device lacks coordination 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.750
 and then the second problem that we face 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 it is that there is an overall inadequacy of the means to deal with the question 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.720
 of malnutrition and hunger in the world action against hunger is constantly on 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.120
 to repeat that this a scourge it's a scandal that's still got 150 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.480
 millions of people who are hungry in the world 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.400
 and it's time on the occasion of these food crises to mobilize the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390
 international community to mobilize public opinion 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 to find additional financial resources 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 to eradicate this scourge in a definitive way 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.270
 and therefore the proposal for action against hunger and create a fund 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.299
 global fight against hunger and malnutrition, which is a vision 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.039
 but more comprehensive and more complementary than what exists 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.760
 today 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.979
 and then which is modes 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.409
 governance and management methods or renovated in break with the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.840
 current device 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 that give confidence 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.810
 and attract new donors 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620
 whether on the state side or on the side 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.250
 private partners or private foundations, especially the large ones 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 private American foundations 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.240
 I think that it has two pitfalls in this level in which it is not necessary 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.159
 fall that is liberalism at all horsehair and consider agriculture and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.460
 agricultural materials 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.529
 still very much like another 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.339
 and then the other pitfall that you have to avoid these two 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.029
 suresnes show it on protect 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:18.009
 and suddenly animated the fluidity of editorial actions and and products 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.949
 food 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.519
 between these two extremes 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.759
 I think there is room for reflection at the level of financial institutions 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.289
 to ask the question as soon as they are the best economic mods for 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.759
 manage it an issue as strategic as crucial as the 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.769
 food question 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.169
 I have no concrete proposals to make but I think that it really 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.289
 that the experts 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.369
 look at this issue we must not fall into the wind in excess 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.349
 that is to say that all bio fuel 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.900
 we do not seem relevant to me since it works from surface to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.779
 detriment 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.199
 of cereal production for human consumption but in all 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.559
 case the question 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.750
 agrofuels 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.489
 do not have the single answer to the food crisis 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.749
 it's only a party party apparently wants 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 relatively modest gold compared to managing this crisis 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.979
 perrier of things skid% and the immediate repercussions convoy because 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.399
 only in IDP camps in refugee camps 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.899
 you have to deal with food distributions 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.309
 and there is a need for additional means to distribute the 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.559
 same amounts of food as themselves in paragliding 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.479
 and then there were also consequences that we see again in somalia eyes 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.549
 in Liberia directly affect problems 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.709
 nutrients and there we have to face we must act 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.779
 to put in place appropriate nutritional treatment, in particular for 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:34.459
 children 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.929
 so that's what we do but also what I called bombs to 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.259
 delaying this severe food crisis from things that are not seen 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.759
 to take a simple example for example at liberia women 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.589
 today 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.229
 rather than two years ago 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.000
 put them in trouble their children 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.260
 and good to change their model and nanterre instead of consuming rice and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.939
 we eat cassava which is going to be a little bit cheaper 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.799
 they may be reducing their number of meals a day to cope 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.420
 to the brief difficulty we see sneakily rising costs and 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.169
 adaptation behavior but may not be able to last very long 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.619
 a long time in the coming months 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.749
 hence the need to devalue statutes and situations 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.440
 in the countryside and in the city 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.260
 and to see which populations targeted that the most affected in the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.439
 coming months since the water 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.349
 all experts agree that the trend 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.619
 2% and inflation on foodstuffs will continue in 

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:24.979
 months and in the years to come 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.210
 so it's all about preparing for the trans-alert to deal with situations 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.370
 that may not appear today but that could 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.469
 appear in the coming months
