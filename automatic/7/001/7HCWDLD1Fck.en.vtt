00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 Hi, my name is bianca duarte. I have 28 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 years and advertising production here in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.090
 Unicid 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 It was a course that brought me many 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.220
 horizons scenarios that I did not know 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.830
 and that made me have a very 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.050
 the market through this 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.930
 I got everything I got. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 today through the teachers who were 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.390
 very attentive through the structure 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 of university structure classes 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.100
 brought me knowledge and luggage to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.750
 facing the labor market 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 I chose to unicid because I come from 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 a very simple origin I had not 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 money to pay for college 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 so I went through several processes of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 public college entrance exams 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 I spent some of them but I went to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 chemistry for programming and I do not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 thank god I found did not work 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 because when I gave so much 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.050
 advertising that I get 100% 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.800
 does not require through the notes that I 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.750
 I reached the event and I identified myself 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.750
 complete I chose does not require because 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.940
 she was a good she is a good college 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.860
 it has a good concept in the market and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.750
 When I came to visit the campus, I liked it. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.750
 I found the fantastic structure too 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.400
 honey 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 I think it rolls in Argentina. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.390
 ae 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.959
 I chose the first advertising 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.340
 contact 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.010
 Actually, I've always worked with 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.750
 service and in the commercial area 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.040
 when I joined the world of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.980
 marketing 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.829
 I was very much in love, I thought 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.319
 strange marketer name but when I 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.239
 I came into this environment to hear everything that was 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.879
 and that I have identified that what I 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.799
 I would like to do was to be an advertiser. 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.689
 even not knowing not knowing 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.000
 profession that's when I made the decision 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.060
 and he saw that he was going to 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 and it worked because I liked it a lot and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.370
 also work very well in the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.319
 financially in the social part I 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.079
 I quite identified with the profession 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.810
 I had several godmothers in us several 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.799
 several godmothers and godparents angels in 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.780
 truth on my side in college that 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.760
 opened the doors for me and gave me 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.290
 a lot of strength when I started 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.930
 college and I had no concept I thought 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.449
 that I could follow area of ​​creation 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.489
 that the advertiser make creation I 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.229
 I imagined Washington olivetto I 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.120
 I need to speak like him right I 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.739
 I need to be a creative person, but I 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.829
 I did not know of any tools 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.870
 For this I knew that I did very well. 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.109
 The service I always worked on 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.150
 and also felt that programs that did not 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.979
 I was pulling a few pieces 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.319
 of social media 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.299
 Only when I started doing the 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.900
 jobs that teachers do 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.000
 began to show the world scenario was 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.269
 very large began to present everything 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.280
 this I started to identify where I 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.229
 I wanted to get there and had an opportunity 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.989
 to work is in the same area as in the 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:59.319
 digital marketing and this opportunity 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.290
 appeared inside the classroom had a 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.629
 was an associate of an agency that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.540
 I was studying with myself and through my 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.379
 work from my notes from my 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.590
 evidences 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.260
 he finds it attractive, is not this kind of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.549
 this kind of note everything and then he 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.310
 He called to work with me 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.820
 invited I came I started in this agency 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.510
 a small agency but brought me a 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.360
 very strong luggage, then the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.400
 digital world he was very so my 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.889
 God, what's going to happen now, nobody? 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.530
 knew what the professional and the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.020
 to do to which side was going then we 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.389
 we go to work giving the face 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.060
 slapped and really lifted a lot of lid 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.350
 people suffered a lot to get everything 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.190
 It's all baggage the whole experience and I 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:57.979
 I left this agency with three months 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.740
 It works because it is the hang of it 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.650
 I did not like working at 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.770
 I managed to get very well there, I left. 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.530
 from there I got unemployed I needed 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.060
 pay the bills and then my boyfriend in 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 Today, my husband said that because 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.020
 you did not open an agency I told him 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.900
 I was crazy, right? 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.210
 a simple working proletariat in the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.830
 agency 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.240
 the salary is very low also in this 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.669
 agency 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.560
 And then he said so, yes, but I think 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.840
 Cool, did you think about it? 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.389
 unemployment insurance and end and I was going to stay 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.200
 no money needed money to 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.349
 to live 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.770
 so I said what I'm going to do 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.710
 is or send you a resume because then 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.479
 time you stand still in the mean time 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.979
 You do not get in touch with your 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.510
 customers because I had very 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.190
 faithful in three months I got 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.050
 finalize many clients 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.729
 they liked my understanding he 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.320
 said why do not you call them and 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.139
 Speak that you are working as 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.220
 freelo until you get something 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.010
 in the market 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.960
 was the way I had money I had to 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.750
 connect and offer a service 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.050
 and then I rely on two large client 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.789
 so it was there that the public was born that is 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.090
 the agency where the work today she 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.479
 was founded in 2011 by me and my 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.479
 husband 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:27.040
 and if you buy the electronic market, it is 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.120
 a market that he goes to steps 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.860
 nelly is always growing 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.919
 currently it grows two digits per 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.810
 year already represents 1% of the Brazilian GDP 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.450
 so to the market that people 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.510
 can see many opportunities 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.919
 IstoÉ is 2014 will be a year of the cup 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.480
 year of event here in brazil super 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.630
 important and how will this be 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.720
 present is essential in our 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.669
 world is I believe the reconcilers 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.190
 they can not imagine but without this resource 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.610
 without this ease of purchase 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.350
 just so you have idea you currently have 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.690
 purchases on the web then the 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.690
 people can have the convenience of making a 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.340
 purchase is for 12 months a ration of 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.700
 dog that we do not have time to 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.250
 buy at the store in from close to home and 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.340
 You get it every month then so 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.470
 just to give you an idea of ​​the size of 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.960
 opportunities that is growing idea 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.600
 no professional shortage is missing 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.479
 need to qualify so I think 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.250
 The business will expand 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:33.720
 in the next few years and will have 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.720
 enough opportunity to offer
