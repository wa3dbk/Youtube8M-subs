00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
to happen it's going to be a hot day

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.990 
to happen it's going to be a hot day
like<00:03:23.859> we<00:03:23.980> said<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.459> there's<00:03:24.609> gonna<00:03:24.699> be<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:24.879> lot

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
like we said and there's gonna be a lot

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.520 
like we said and there's gonna be a lot
of<00:03:25.060> people<00:03:25.180> who<00:03:25.569> kind<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.900> fall<00:03:26.049> off<00:03:26.199> the<00:03:26.349> pace

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
of people who kind of fall off the pace

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.080 
of people who kind of fall off the pace
later<00:03:26.829> in<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.069> race<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.459> think<00:03:27.849> it's<00:03:27.940> going<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
later in the race I think it's going to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.170 
later in the race I think it's going to
take<00:03:28.299> 15-30<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:29.169> 1545<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.129> win<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> mm-hmm<00:03:30.909> so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
take 15-30 to 1545 to win it mm-hmm so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.149 
take 15-30 to 1545 to win it mm-hmm so
you<00:03:31.269> pace<00:03:31.540> your<00:03:31.720> race<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.260> run<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.859> kind<00:03:33.040> of

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
you pace your race to run that kind of

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.569 
you pace your race to run that kind of
finish<00:03:33.430> time<00:03:33.669> and<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:35.260> know<00:03:35.379> if<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:36.010> can<00:03:36.220> run<00:03:36.400> in

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
finish time and you know if I can run in

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.339 
finish time and you know if I can run in
that<00:03:36.699> range<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.359> think<00:03:37.599> I'm<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.169> be

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
that range and I think I'm going to be

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.009 
that range and I think I'm going to be
I'm<00:03:38.620> going<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.919> be<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.159> mix<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.870> we'll<00:03:40.870> see

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
I'm going to be in the mix so we'll see

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.110 
I'm going to be in the mix so we'll see
I<00:03:41.199> the<00:03:41.680> way<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.829> think<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.370> probably<00:03:42.760> going<00:03:43.030> to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
I the way I think it probably going to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.830 
I the way I think it probably going to
go<00:03:43.269> out<00:03:43.449> as<00:03:43.659> they'll<00:03:43.840> be<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.319> lead<00:03:45.280> pack<00:03:45.840> that'll

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
go out as they'll be a lead pack that'll

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.830 
go out as they'll be a lead pack that'll
probably<00:03:46.870> go<00:03:47.199> out<00:03:47.229> hard<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.120> chased

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
probably go out hard and then I chased

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.930 
probably go out hard and then I chased
back<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.919> myself<00:03:51.069> being<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.699> chase

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
sure you doubting the VA station just

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.330 
sure you doubting the VA station just
you<00:04:31.690> know<00:04:31.810> do<00:04:32.020> what<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.260> can<00:04:32.440> stay<00:04:32.680> cool<00:04:32.890> so<00:04:33.280> if

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
you know do what you can stay cool so if

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.680 
you know do what you can stay cool so if
you<00:04:33.400> gonna<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.670> back<00:04:33.700> off<00:04:34.060> during<00:04:34.630> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you gonna have to back off during the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.060 
you gonna have to back off during the
heat<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.930> day<00:04:35.020> does<00:04:35.170> it<00:04:35.260> mean<00:04:35.380> maybe<00:04:35.800> push

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
heat of the day does it mean maybe push

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.620 
heat of the day does it mean maybe push
a<00:04:36.100> little<00:04:36.220> more<00:04:36.430> early<00:04:36.970> well<00:04:37.330> I've<00:04:37.600> been

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
a little more early well I've been

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.020 
a little more early well I've been
thinking<00:04:37.720> about<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.590> yeah<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.400> think

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
thinking about that and yeah I think

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.280 
thinking about that and yeah I think
there<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:40.510> some<00:04:40.660> group<00:04:40.840> sets<00:04:41.050> for<00:04:41.200> that

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
there is some group sets for that

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.760 
there is some group sets for that
strategy<00:04:41.470> maybe<00:04:42.070> push<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:42.490> through<00:04:43.060> to

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
strategy maybe push a little through to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.680 
strategy maybe push a little through to
aha<00:04:44.770> maybe<00:04:45.040> Robinson<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.940> then<00:04:46.030> cruise<00:04:46.420> the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
it's gonna be better than that so it's

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.760

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
gonna be 25 degrees hotter so it's going

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.460 
gonna be 25 degrees hotter so it's going
to<00:05:50.830> be<00:05:50.919> really<00:05:51.250> hot<00:05:51.520> going<00:05:51.760> down<00:05:51.970> there<00:05:52.470> and

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
to be really hot going down there and

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.080 
to be really hot going down there and
then<00:05:53.950> up<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.220> Green<00:05:54.400> Gate<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.760> course<00:05:54.940> it's

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
then up to Green Gate of course it's

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.490 
then up to Green Gate of course it's
super<00:05:55.360> exposed<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:56.020> that's<00:05:56.200> going<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.440> be

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
super exposed so that's going to be

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.700 
super exposed so that's going to be
super<00:05:56.740> hot<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.160> then<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.640> get<00:05:57.760> in<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.030> trees
