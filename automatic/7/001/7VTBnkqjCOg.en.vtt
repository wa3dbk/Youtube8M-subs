00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.459 
around there and to be caught by the
wind<00:04:38.729> always<00:04:39.270> was<00:04:39.659> a<00:04:39.689> somewhat<00:04:40.229> uncomfortable

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
wind always was a somewhat uncomfortable

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.070 
wind always was a somewhat uncomfortable
experience<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.789> didn't<00:04:42.389> have<00:04:42.479> great<00:04:42.719> regard

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
experience so I didn't have great regard

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.839 
experience so I didn't have great regard
for<00:04:43.349> them<00:04:43.499> but<00:04:43.710> they<00:04:43.830> were<00:04:43.889> part<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
for them but they were part of the

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.540 
for them but they were part of the
tissue<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:46.050> fabric<00:04:46.559> of<00:04:46.740> New<00:04:46.919> York<00:04:47.309> and

tissue the fabric of New York and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.089 
tissue the fabric of New York and
certainly<00:04:47.969> in<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:49.020> mountain<00:04:49.439> range<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:50.069> I

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
certainly in the mountain range that I

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.610 
certainly in the mountain range that I
was<00:04:50.400> photographing<00:04:51.180> from<00:04:51.389> my<00:04:51.569> studio<00:04:51.930> they

was photographing from my studio they

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.260 
was photographing from my studio they
played<00:04:52.979> their<00:04:53.580> part<00:04:54.449> of<00:04:54.719> the<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:56.639> know<00:04:56.759> the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
played their part of the you know the

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:03.749 
New York so so certainly there was a

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.760 
New York so so certainly there was a
kind<00:05:04.259> of<00:05:05.360> love-hate<00:05:06.360> relationship<00:05:07.319> with

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
