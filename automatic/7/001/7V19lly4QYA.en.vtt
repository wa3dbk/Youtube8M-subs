00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:44.390

 and good people welcome to my degree and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 then I'm a master and well we're in another 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 super gameplay in another Spanish record no 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.370
 as age 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 You saw me leaving spain we are with 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.150
 two hundred and twenty casualties the specialist 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 besides adding a triple and one of 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 them in 85 s in 45 seconds forgive something 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 quite pretty amazing I do not know that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 it's terminal but the guys as you know 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.970
 this is this kind of that starts a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 impossible to get on another map though 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.760
 there would be some that could be 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.300
 possible but we are not so quick nor 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.670
 so many casualties not good too if it's that 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.010
 at the beginning I saw the run of 22 in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 27 seconds that was the one that his wine that 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.360
 is something bestial do not like as 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.270
 the reading not for a hundred love 85 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 seconds and good as well these are 220 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 to start after a whole team of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.119

 both so why do not I tell them 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 to understand ourselves lives and so on, not so 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.560
 well we would be missing two although in all 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 case we would be proof of all 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.780

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.750

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.650
 There are kids and also if 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.450
 play at least a little during the week 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.340
 even if it's just one or two games 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.870
 when losing so as not to lose 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.660
