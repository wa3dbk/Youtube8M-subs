00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.970
 Hi, welcome to another video of the last 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 only the second 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.260
 bitrem trailer and today let's finish 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 this thumbnail 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.749
 the process is the same as in the first 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.490
 some mdf pieces let it dry 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:35.890
 use some providers to help 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:38.280
 even some ready now that we have the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.019
 body, let's make a load 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.719
 The first thing is to take the 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.620
 body width and length 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.929
 but attention to the internal measurement and 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.329
 leaves a few millimeters less 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.379
 then pass these measures to a 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.170
 cardboard 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.620
 I'm not going to spend anything with this 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.499
 because she will not show up I'm 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.019
 making four adults each side has 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.970
 almost the same length and width of the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:14.170
 body because if it is the same 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:16.090
 length it will not fit and will not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.119
 forget to leave some water for later 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.200
 roll after doing all the lines 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.200
 let's remember 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 then just fold in the closed lines and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.730
 necklace 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.640
 let dry thoroughly before continuing what 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.950
 now we're going to fit into the body and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240
 we will use these same measures to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.850
 make the canvas 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.190
 only this time I'm going to make a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.450
 centimeter less so as not to hide the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.060
 bodywork 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 this time using a sheet of paper 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.210
 brown 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.960
 note that it has one frosted side and one 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.090
 dangerous 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.100
 I'm going to use the dull side to make the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 canvas then I'll scratch on the religious side 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.320
 make the lines as the video 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.630
 use the measurements in your thumbnail if you 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can use a piece of cloth 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.460
 as we did on the sack 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.980
 Your choice 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.850
 I found it cool to show other ways 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.850
 make the canvas 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.430
 is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.970
 after doing all the straight is only 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.310
 cut and fold on the lines like this 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.460
 Paper is too thin 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.920
 They help when folding but this can 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.920
 be solved with the aid of a ruler 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.520
 a lady ruler of 50 centimeters 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.240
 then it becomes easier to bend and then we 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.240
 do the following 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.950
 fold well on the four lines and then 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.930
 noble corners as the video the paper 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.260
 have to fold in after 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.010
 let's paste this part do it in 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.010
 four corners 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.540
 If you want you can make another fold to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.540
 take the time to fit the canvas 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.040
 done that, let's paste the fields 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.470
 then we'll stick the ends make the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.290
 same thing on both sides and then 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.600
 we will remember a possible excess for 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.050
 ensure that you will not be appearing the 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050
 fold 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.599
 ready made the adjustments let's cover the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.910
 cardboard say let's install the tarp 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.310
 you can replace the cardboard with 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.220
 anything else a box of juice 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.389
 or milk provided that they remain in the size 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.940
 wanted 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.500
 the next step is to pass a string to 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.080
 under canvas 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.560
 remember those pins that we put in the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 beginning as it is now we use them 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.449
 the marvel string on the first wine and 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.610
 then it 's only going from one side to the 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.610
 another through the pins 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:30.360
 then go through the sides and over 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:33.120
 also tie and tie at the end and is 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 ready and towing do the same thing 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.849
 I put the brown paper in the other 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.039
 the other side to see the difference almost 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:45.780
 does not notice another is more 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:48.389
 brightness and to finish I'll use more 113 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.409
 orange color I have to pull 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.110
 this bitrem 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:55.939
 Anyway, after so much work, I 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.939
 I deserve to have some fun 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.539
 I had childhood 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.219
 only that in my time I did not have these 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:13.250
 thumbnails and we're staying here opzz 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:16.740
 almost get off the road 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:19.469
 if you have more miniatures you can do 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.610
 many combinations just drop the 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:23.339
 imagination 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.930

 leave your suggestions for new 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.289
 but have patience since each 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.509
 project takes quite a while 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:35.509
