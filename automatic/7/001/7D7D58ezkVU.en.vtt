talk about people been experiencing
strange<00:00:23.880> sounds<00:00:24.449> around<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.019> world<00:00:25.310> like

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
strange sounds around the world like

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.200 
strange sounds around the world like
rumbling<00:00:26.970> sounds<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.890> loud<00:00:29.189> noises<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
rumbling sounds really loud noises and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
rumbling sounds really loud noises and
people<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.840> questioning<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.619> some<00:00:32.340> believe

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
people are questioning it some believe

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.049 
people are questioning it some believe
it's<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> couple<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> end<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.649> time

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
it's the a couple it's the end of time

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's the a couple it's the end of time
but<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.660> know<00:00:36.750> i<00:00:37.020> don't<00:00:37.230> believe<00:00:37.649> these

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
but I don't know i don't believe these

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030 
but I don't know i don't believe these
things<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.940> did<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:39.870> resume<00:00:40.710> about

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
things so I did a little resume about

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880 
things so I did a little resume about
solar<00:00:41.399> storm<00:00:41.820> may<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.690> people<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.710> they

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
solar storm may be that people what they

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
solar storm may be that people what they
hear<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.910> sounds<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:45.570> comes<00:00:45.930> from<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
hear the sounds maybe comes from the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.760 
hear the sounds maybe comes from the
solar<00:00:46.590> system<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.610> let's<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.649> scientists<00:00:49.649> has

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
solar system so let's see scientists has

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
solar system so let's see scientists has
been<00:00:50.010> warning<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> sun's<00:00:51.210> solar<00:00:51.539> cycle

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
been warning that the sun's solar cycle

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.670 
been warning that the sun's solar cycle
which<00:00:52.469> peaks<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.039> 2012<00:00:54.000> could<00:00:54.690> cause<00:00:54.930> powerful

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
solar storms that could leave many

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
solar storms that could leave many

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and electricity for months solar storm

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
and electricity for months solar storm
starts<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> powerful<00:01:05.040> magnetic<00:01:05.790> fields

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
starts with a powerful magnetic fields

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.109 
starts with a powerful magnetic fields
in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> Sun<00:01:06.810> which<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.380> snap<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:08.040> any<00:01:08.119> time

in the Sun which can snap at any time

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.780 
in the Sun which can snap at any time

the explosion can hit earth at about a

the explosion can hit earth at about a
million<00:01:17.880> miles<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.570> hour<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.310> does<00:01:20.520> like

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
million miles an hour so it does like

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.320 
million miles an hour so it does like
crackling<00:01:21.750> noise<00:01:22.549> explosions<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> don't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
crackling noise explosions so I don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
crackling noise explosions so I don't
know<00:01:24.540> maybe<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.140> data<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.799> hearing

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
know maybe it's data we're hearing

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
know maybe it's data we're hearing
another<00:01:27.150> concern<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.229> researcher

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
another concern is that researcher

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
another concern is that researcher

we should be too but scientists say

and the degree other in intensity so we
know<00:02:24.210> there's<00:02:24.480> little<00:02:24.960> explosion<00:02:25.770> around<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
know there's little explosion around the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.050 
know there's little explosion around the
solar<00:02:26.790> system<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.140> maybe<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.280> why<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:29.700> here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
solar system so maybe that's why we here

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.990 
solar system so maybe that's why we here
in<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.390> atmosphere<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:31.500> know<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.980> don't<00:02:32.670> think

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
in the atmosphere you know I don't think

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.510 
in the atmosphere you know I don't think
it's<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> ground<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.230> believe<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.250> more

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
it's on the ground I believe it's more

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.110 
it's on the ground I believe it's more
atmosphere<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.709> should<00:02:37.740> take<00:02:38.100> an<00:02:38.280> eye<00:02:38.490> up

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
atmosphere so we should take an eye up

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.260 
atmosphere so we should take an eye up
in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> sky<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.740> don't<00:02:41.040> worry<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.820> know<00:02:42.000> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
in the sky so don't worry you know I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.410 
in the sky so don't worry you know I
mean<00:02:42.930> look<00:02:43.440> they're<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.880> hundred<00:02:45.000> percent

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
mean look they're not a hundred percent

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.840 
mean look they're not a hundred percent
I<00:02:46.610> create<00:02:47.610> about<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.620> maybe<00:02:49.890> while<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.400> here

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I create about it so maybe while we here

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.270 
I create about it so maybe while we here
it's<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.810> leave<00:02:52.080> me<00:02:52.110> your<00:02:52.410> your<00:02:53.040> your
