00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
is that this gets put out becomes

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.200 
is that this gets put out becomes
mainstream<00:00:54.680> newsworthy<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.550> sends<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> lot

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
mainstream newsworthy and it sends a lot

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
mainstream newsworthy and it sends a lot
of<00:00:57.329> mixed<00:00:57.690> messages<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.879> go<00:01:00.000> back<00:01:00.239> and

of mixed messages and as we go back and

a measurement and survey analysis

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
a measurement and survey analysis
looking<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> Canadians<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.540> were

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
looking at Canadians that were

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
looking at Canadians that were
participating<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> program<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
participating in a program for the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Prevention of that vascular disease the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
Prevention of that vascular disease the
participants<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.240> already<00:01:12.510> had<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.290> sort

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
participants had already had some sort

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
participants had already had some sort
of<00:01:13.680> vascular<00:01:14.189> complications<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.150> qualify

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of vascular complications that qualify

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
of vascular complications that qualify
them<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> program<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> means<00:01:17.520> all

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
them for the program so this means all

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.460 
them for the program so this means all
the<00:01:18.000> participants<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.080> were<00:01:19.140> looking

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the participants that they were looking

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
the participants that they were looking
at<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:20.310> already<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.270> version<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
at had already had some version of a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
at had already had some version of a
stroke<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> mini<00:01:23.100> stroke<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.090> can

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stroke or a mini stroke right so we can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
stroke or a mini stroke right so we can
assume<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.930> weren't<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> healthy<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
assume they weren't that healthy to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
assume they weren't that healthy to
begin<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.240> brought<00:01:27.479> these

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
begin with then they brought these

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
begin with then they brought these
participants<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.400> asked<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.880> how

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
participants in and they asked them how

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.240 
participants in and they asked them how
much<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.840> smoke<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> also<00:01:32.040> how

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
much do they smoke and also how

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
much do they smoke and also how
frequently<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.210> consume<00:01:33.630> eggs<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
frequently do they consume eggs the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.590 
frequently do they consume eggs the
median<00:01:35.430> age<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.479> 62<00:01:37.200> years<00:01:37.560> old<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
median age was about 62 years old and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.090 
median age was about 62 years old and
what<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.750> found<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.619> measured

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
what they found and then they measured

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
what they found and then they measured
the<00:01:41.280> carotid<00:01:41.880> artery<00:01:42.329> thickness<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.409> plaque

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the carotid artery thickness for plaque

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
the carotid artery thickness for plaque
and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.220> used<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.350> analysis<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and then they used you know analysis to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
and then they used you know analysis to
find<00:01:46.710> correlations<00:01:47.130> between<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.939> smoking

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
find correlations between the smoking

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
find correlations between the smoking
and<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> egg<00:01:49.350> consumption<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.640> drew

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and the egg consumption and they drew

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
and the egg consumption and they drew
the<00:01:51.030> conclusion<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.600> those<00:01:51.990> people<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the conclusion that those people that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.370 
the conclusion that those people that
smoke<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.399> eight<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.180> eggs<00:01:54.360> had<00:01:54.960> more

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
smoke more or eight more eggs had more

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.280 
smoke more or eight more eggs had more
at<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.700> thick<00:01:57.000> plaque<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> carotid

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
at a more thick plaque in the carotid

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.749 
at a more thick plaque in the carotid
arteries<00:01:58.729> and<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.890> smoking's

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
arteries and so just like that smoking's

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
arteries and so just like that smoking's
bad<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> eggs<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.930> bad<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.290> that's<00:02:04.439> not

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
bad and eggs are bad and that's not

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
bad and eggs are bad and that's not
really<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> case<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
really the case and this is really a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
really the case and this is really a
very<00:02:06.810> bad<00:02:07.409> study<00:02:08.030> because<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.560> participants

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
very bad study because the participants

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
very bad study because the participants
had<00:02:11.370> already<00:02:11.790> had<00:02:12.270> some<00:02:12.870> sort<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> vascular

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
had already had some sort of vascular

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
had already had some sort of vascular
application<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.900> imagine<00:02:16.020> they

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
application so I would imagine they

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.370 
application so I would imagine they
weren't<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.800> healthy<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> begin<00:02:17.400> with<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
weren't that healthy to begin with and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.780 
weren't that healthy to begin with and
asking<00:02:19.380> someone<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:19.890> many<00:02:20.070> eggs<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:20.520> eat

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
asking someone how many eggs they eat

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.910 
asking someone how many eggs they eat
doesn't<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:21.660> take<00:02:22.020> into<00:02:22.230> consideration

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
doesn't really take into consideration

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.500 
doesn't really take into consideration
what<00:02:23.220> kind<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.580> eggs<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.210> are<00:02:24.390> they

drawing<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.390> broad<00:03:51.660> conclusion<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.800> then<00:03:53.310> also

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
drawing a broad conclusion and then also

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.970 
drawing a broad conclusion and then also
when<00:03:54.030> we<00:03:54.180> take<00:03:54.450> multiple<00:03:55.200> studies<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.800> can

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
when we take multiple studies we can

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.470 
when we take multiple studies we can
actually<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.430> problems<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.060> drawing<00:03:57.360> a

broad conclusion and there was a study

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.310 
broad conclusion and there was a study
