building I'll bring the outside of the
building<00:00:53.430> either<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.390> does<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
building either way does it really

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
matter and then you end up just in this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
matter and then you end up just in this
little<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.570> path<00:00:57.780> rod<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.289> some

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
little like little path rod here some

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
little like little path rod here some
people<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.160> spawn<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.670> but<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.329> very

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
people can spawn there but it's not very

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
people can spawn there but it's not very
often<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
often that they will do and now this is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
often that they will do and now this is
the<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.460> important<00:01:02.910> part<00:01:02.940> you've<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the most important part you've got this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
the most important part you've got this
building<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> wanna<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.369> go

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
building here so what you wanna do is go

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.710 
building here so what you wanna do is go
into<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.880> building<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.689> see

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
into this building and as you can see

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
into this building and as you can see
the<00:01:06.900> point<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.250> basically

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the point is right there so basically

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
the point is right there so basically
you<00:01:08.760> jump<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> building<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you jump out to this building which is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
you jump out to this building which is
pretty<00:01:10.229> hidden<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> points<00:01:11.640> right

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
pretty hidden and then the points right

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.039 
pretty hidden and then the points right
there<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.900> got

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
there so as you can see I just got

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
there so as you can see I just got
another<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.350> though<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> I'll<00:01:14.430> repeat<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
another one though and I'll repeat it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
another one though and I'll repeat it
again<00:01:15.119> I'll<00:01:15.270> speed<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.869> until<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.590> finish

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
again I'll speed this up until we finish

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.410 
again I'll speed this up until we finish
cause<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:17.939> captures<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
cause I think I get three captures in a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
cause I think I get three captures in a
row<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.369> another<00:01:20.369> teammate<00:01:20.640> does

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
row and then another teammate does

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
row and then another teammate does
actually<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.330> another<00:01:21.509> captcha<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.259> we'll

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
actually get another captcha so we'll

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
actually get another captcha so we'll
leave<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.880> we'll<00:01:24.060> move<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
leave this now and then we'll move on to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.800 
leave this now and then we'll move on to
the<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.900> side<00:01:26.210> okay<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.780> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the other side okay so now that we're on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.090 
the other side okay so now that we're on
the<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:27.990> side<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> map<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.860> actually

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the other side of the map I'm actually

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
the other side of the map I'm actually
going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> show<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> route<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
going to show you the route that you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
going to show you the route that you
want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> absolutely

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
want to take now this one is absolutely

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
want to take now this one is absolutely
take<00:01:32.400> slightly<00:01:32.820> longer<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
take slightly longer because you want to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
take slightly longer because you want to
stay<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> outskirts<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> mat<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
stay on the outskirts with the mat and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.580 
stay on the outskirts with the mat and
like<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.299> said<00:01:36.479> before<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like I said before so you just want to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.780 
like I said before so you just want to
throw<00:01:37.710> I'll<00:01:37.860> run<00:01:38.369> through<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.640> these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
throw I'll run through all these

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
throw I'll run through all these
buildings<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> XX<00:01:39.659> nobody<00:01:40.229> honestly

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
buildings on the XX nobody honestly

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
buildings on the XX nobody honestly
really<00:01:40.740> comes<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.299> just

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
really comes this way and then you just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.460 
really comes this way and then you just
want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> run<00:01:42.810> through<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:43.290> here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
want to run through the back here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
want to run through the back here
because<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.369> never<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.850> anybody<00:01:45.090> around

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
because you never see anybody around

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
because you never see anybody around
here<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> getting<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
here so this is just getting you that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.069 
here so this is just getting you that
slight<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.579> closer<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.149> ease<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
slight bit closer with ease so you just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
slight bit closer with ease so you just
climb<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.500> these<00:01:49.619> um<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> stuffer

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
climb up these um this these a stuffer

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
climb up these um this these a stuffer
and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.380> run<00:01:52.560> through<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and you run through the back like this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.010 
and you run through the back like this
now<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.509> many<00:01:54.689> people

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
now you don't really see many people

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.069 
now you don't really see many people
over<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> couple<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.759> I

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
over here you can see a couple but I

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.090 
over here you can see a couple but I
that's<00:01:58.079> someone<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.530> either<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.009> can

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's someone here either so you can

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.069 
that's someone here either so you can
kill<00:01:59.340> him<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.700> boom<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.659> cities<00:02:00.930> 02

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
kill him and then boom that cities 02

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
kill him and then boom that cities 02
the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> only<00:02:02.250> problem<00:02:02.579> with

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the way now and the only problem with

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.280 
the way now and the only problem with
this<00:02:02.880> earth<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.329> its<00:02:03.479> own<00:02:03.780> company<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this earth is its own company on the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
this earth is its own company on the
ship<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> time<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.969> harder<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> see

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
ship all the time it is harder to see

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.550 
ship all the time it is harder to see
though<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.990> don't<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.229> look<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
though because they don't really look in

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.630 
though because they don't really look in
this<00:02:07.619> direction<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.310> there's<00:02:08.489> still<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
this direction but there's still a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.770 
this direction but there's still a
possibility<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.300> could<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.509> someone<00:02:09.660> on

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
possibility that I could be someone on

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
possibility that I could be someone on
the<00:02:09.929> ship<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.170> watching<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.670> flag

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the ship just watching you and this flag

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.900 
the ship just watching you and this flag
is<00:02:12.000> instant<00:02:12.120> heard

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
is instant heard

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.760 
is instant heard
capture<00:02:13.240> business<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.900> open<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.710> you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
capture business more in the open so you

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.020 
capture business more in the open so you
just<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.280> hide<00:02:15.460> your<00:02:15.610> way<00:02:15.700> around<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
just have to hide your way around the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.730 
just have to hide your way around the
rocks<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.420> actually<00:02:17.110> use<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.440> sliding

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
rocks and actually use your sliding

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.100 
rocks and actually use your sliding
process<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.610> i'm<00:02:18.850> using<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.780> sliding

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
process because i'm using the sliding

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
process because i'm using the sliding
technique<00:02:20.350> does<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.860> help<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.250> lot<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.030> as

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
technique does that to help a lot so as

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.400 
technique does that to help a lot so as
you<00:02:22.210> can<00:02:22.300> see<00:02:22.450> again<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.870> actually<00:02:23.050> score

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you can see again I do actually score

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.860 
you can see again I do actually score
idea<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.830> almost<00:02:24.100> got<00:02:24.250> killed<00:02:24.490> for<00:02:24.780> local<00:02:25.780> I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
idea I almost got killed for local I

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110 
idea I almost got killed for local I
think<00:02:26.080> my<00:02:26.140> teammate<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.130> guy<00:02:27.280> out<00:02:27.460> anyway

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
think my teammate to the guy out anyway

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.040 
think my teammate to the guy out anyway
as<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.300> see<00:02:28.450> I'm<00:02:28.540> running<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:28.810> I'll

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
as you can see I'm running here I'll

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
as you can see I'm running here I'll
just<00:02:29.230> slide<00:02:29.440> around<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.740> back<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
just slide around the back of the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.350 
just slide around the back of the
building<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.430> call<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.730> live<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.090> long<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
building I call this live for long the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.710 
building I call this live for long the
bar<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.780> was<00:02:32.080> quite<00:02:32.200> safe<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
bar I was quite safe and I just do the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
bar I was quite safe and I just do the
exact<00:02:35.080> same<00:02:35.110> route<00:02:35.560> again<00:02:35.800> no<00:02:36.190> I'm<00:02:36.280> much<00:02:36.400> done

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
exact same route again no I'm much done

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.980 
exact same route again no I'm much done
I<00:02:36.640> think<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.030> nine-point<00:02:37.240> street<00:02:37.840> right

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
I think it's a nine-point street right

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.530 
I think it's a nine-point street right
now<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.130> effectiveness<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.000> route<00:02:40.300> can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
now so this effectiveness this route can

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.600 
now so this effectiveness this route can
actually<00:02:40.840> help<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.770> do<00:02:41.920> as<00:02:42.190> well<00:02:42.340> because

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
actually help you can do as well because
