I'm gonna do a control Z I'll rewind the
storyboard<00:03:58.590> there<00:03:59.590> we<00:03:59.709> go<00:03:59.860> now<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.370> should

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
storyboard there we go now I should

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.610 
storyboard there we go now I should
change<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.940> size<00:04:01.120> here<00:04:01.420> grab<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.350> corner

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620

change the size here grab this corner
and<00:04:02.950> slide<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> little<00:04:04.180> bit<00:04:04.300> smaller<00:04:04.600> now

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
and slide it a little bit smaller now

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.840 
and slide it a little bit smaller now
when<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.470> run<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.770> animation<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.400> will<00:04:06.580> change

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
when I run the animation it will change

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.770 
when I run the animation it will change
in<00:04:07.030> size<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.680> also<00:04:08.680> rotate<00:04:09.459> let's<00:04:10.390> look<00:04:10.600> at<00:04:10.690> in

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
in size and also rotate let's look at in

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.420 
in size and also rotate let's look at in
the<00:04:10.840> storyboard<00:04:11.320> I'm<00:04:11.920> gonna<00:04:12.130> make<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.370> a

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the storyboard I'm gonna make this a

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.550 
the storyboard I'm gonna make this a
little<00:04:12.670> bit<00:04:12.850> taller<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.570> we're<00:04:14.410> going<00:04:14.530> to

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
little bit taller and we're going to

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.680 
little bit taller and we're going to
look<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.920> image<00:04:15.040> if<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.910> expand<00:04:16.359> this<00:04:16.510> you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
look in the image if I expand this you

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.420 
look in the image if I expand this you
can<00:04:16.780> see<00:04:16.900> there's<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.140> render<00:04:17.470> transform<00:04:18.100> and

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
can see there's a render transform and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.650 
can see there's a render transform and
in<00:04:19.330> there's<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.600> rotation<00:04:20.430> for<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.520> angle<00:04:21.940> this

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
in there's a rotation for the angle this

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.450 
in there's a rotation for the angle this
is<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.140> value<00:04:23.440> that's<00:04:23.530> being<00:04:23.650> animated<00:04:24.190> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
is the value that's being animated the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.760 
is the value that's being animated the
angle<00:04:24.970> property<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:26.020> right<00:04:26.350> click<00:04:26.380> on<00:04:26.650> this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
angle property I can right click on this

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.340 
angle property I can right click on this
and<00:04:26.919> say<00:04:27.160> edit<00:04:27.370> repeat<00:04:27.789> count<00:04:28.140> let's<00:04:29.140> say<00:04:29.289> you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
and say edit repeat count let's say you

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.700 
and say edit repeat count let's say you
know

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
know

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080
