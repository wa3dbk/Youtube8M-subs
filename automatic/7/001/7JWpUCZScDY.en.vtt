00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
unboxings for us because we usually get

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.010

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
lightning pot I'm not really sure about

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.500 
lightning pot I'm not really sure about
the<00:01:06.750> screen<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.650> taller<00:01:08.159> obviously<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the screen it is taller obviously but we

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.929 
the screen it is taller obviously but we
definitely<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.310> display<00:01:11.580> with

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
definitely have to see the display with

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
definitely have to see the display with
turned<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
turned on so that we can really see the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.899 
turned on so that we can really see the
difference<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.830> usual<00:01:17.009> cuts<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.759> was

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
difference and the usual cuts that was

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
difference and the usual cuts that was
seen<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> iPhone<00:01:18.689> 4<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.020> 4s<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> little

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
seen on the iPhone 4 and 4s is a little

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
seen on the iPhone 4 and 4s is a little
bit<00:01:20.369> different<00:01:21.020> usually<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> slot

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
bit different usually there was a slot

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
bit different usually there was a slot
there<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:23.670> cut<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> time

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
there where they cut it but this time

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
there where they cut it but this time
they<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.960> filled<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.580> color<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
they have filled it with the color of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
they have filled it with the color of
your<00:01:27.150> choice<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.380> either<00:01:28.560> white<00:01:28.890> or

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
your choice which is either white or

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
your choice which is either white or
black<00:01:29.400> depending<00:01:29.460> upon<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> model<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.720> have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
black depending upon the model you have

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649

maybe yeah something new here is the new
ear<00:01:51.509> pods<00:01:51.930> which<00:01:52.710> Apple<00:01:53.340> apparently<00:01:53.850> have

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
ear pods which Apple apparently have

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.990 
ear pods which Apple apparently have
scanned<00:01:54.360> tons<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.930> ears<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.790> finally<00:01:56.790> come

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
scanned tons of ears and finally come

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.800 
scanned tons of ears and finally come
about<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.450> design<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.170> actually<00:01:59.780> pushes<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
about the design that actually pushes a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.440 
about the design that actually pushes a
lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> music<00:02:01.590> into<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.009> ears<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
lot of music into your ears and it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
lot of music into your ears and it's
supposed<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.049> work<00:02:04.320> well<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.680> I'm

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
supposed to really work well but I'm

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
supposed to really work well but I'm
really<00:02:05.130> skeptical<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:07.140> ear

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
really skeptical about it because my ear

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.949 
really skeptical about it because my ear
does<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.520> go<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> in-ear<00:02:09.690> type

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
does not really go with the in-ear type

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.559 
does not really go with the in-ear type
of<00:02:10.110> headphones<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.580> check<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
of headphones so I got really check that

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.940 
of headphones so I got really check that
like

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
like

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.520 
like
now<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.930> apple<00:02:16.930> lightning<00:02:17.170> port

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
now this is the apple lightning port

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.090 
now this is the apple lightning port
connector<00:02:18.010> which<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.620> new<00:02:20.620> kind<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
connector which is a new kind of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.860 
connector which is a new kind of
connector<00:02:21.490> they<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.760> invented<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.630> seems

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
connector they have invented it seems

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.800 
connector they have invented it seems
and<00:02:23.370> what<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> like<00:02:24.700> about<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.630> can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and what I like about it is that you can

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.690 
and what I like about it is that you can
connect<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.260> either<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.340> don't<00:02:27.460> have

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
connect it either way so you don't have

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.180 
connect it either way so you don't have
to<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:28.120> connect<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.110> always<00:02:29.530> one<00:02:29.770> side<00:02:30.010> up

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
to really connect it always one side up

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.970 
to really connect it always one side up
you<00:02:30.460> can<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:30.790> pin<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:30.940> anyway<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:32.770> have

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you can just pin it anyway and we have

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.890 
you can just pin it anyway and we have
the<00:02:33.130> standard<00:02:33.460> european<00:02:34.030> plug<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:37.000> let's<00:02:37.240> take

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the standard european plug so let's take

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.140

introduced the Lightning connector in

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.140 
introduced the Lightning connector in
the<00:03:29.140> iphone<00:03:29.590> 5<00:03:29.880> replacing<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> traditional

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
the iphone 5 replacing the traditional

the iphone 5 replacing the traditional
30<00:03:31.750> pin<00:03:31.989> connector<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:33.040> Lightning<00:03:33.400> connector

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
30 pin connector the Lightning connector

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.910 
30 pin connector the Lightning connector
is<00:03:33.940> supposed<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.450> be<00:03:34.570> faster<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.470> way

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
is supposed to be faster and it's way

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.259 
is supposed to be faster and it's way
smaller<00:03:36.220> compared<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.060> previous

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
smaller compared to the previous

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.840 
smaller compared to the previous
connector<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.049> it's<00:03:38.769> reversible<00:03:39.250> which

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
connector and it's reversible which

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.750 
connector and it's reversible which
means<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.269> can<00:03:40.450> connect<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.870> either<00:03:41.080> way

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
means you can connect it either way

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.190 
means you can connect it either way
