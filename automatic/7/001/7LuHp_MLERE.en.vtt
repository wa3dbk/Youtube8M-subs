00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:10.680
 She 's been in a state where I just stretched 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 The top layer is the floor by say I want to change have Well something Hen'a style radically this time 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.289
 In advance 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.950
 Basically to the bottom and leave the image 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.780
 a 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:26.340
 On the other hand the hottest thing in which the thickness to come down to the bottom is what one is the best had been accumulated under Nde 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.170
 I liked way up 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.170
 By Mayer has entered this sentence 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.590
 Here is the most expansive place when the top hair falls 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:47.100
 I've raised the layer from that Bob's state that 1 was at the bottom, so I'm sorry 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:53.699
 This part will be the one that swells most 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:58.970
 The right side still has a part I'm making all the time on the right side, so with my right hand 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.140
 I think you think I use of'll over is pretty ingrained in person 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.140
 Ignore it 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.910
 Even if you make bangs that flow from left to right 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.969
 I chose but bought 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.560
 This gradation color is applied this time and it is gradually understood toward the end of the hair 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.759
 Has become in such a way that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 So when it works 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:36.460
 In the dark , she had originally had a lot of hair on the left side 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.460
 More than before 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.230
 Blood flow 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.230
 Hmm 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.960
 I moved the hair to the place where I thought it was overdone at first and looked there 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.150
 It is better to suppress from 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:10.959
 Think in the head or it will be interesting styling 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:14.230
 It is a cut that was accumulated each time and how the result was matched to that child every time 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.980
 Please do find the thing called or the singer Henriette 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.819
 In the case of her this time I was able to do something good in terms of changing the mood 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.819
 I do not think
