we move on to Town Hall 10 with this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.050 
we move on to Town Hall 10 with this
true<00:02:05.229> capacity<00:02:05.439> definitely<00:02:06.369> easier<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.880> bring

3 golems to the attack and we're looking

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.009 
3 golems to the attack and we're looking
at<00:02:08.979> one<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.160> my<00:02:09.310> own<00:02:09.460> replays<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.450> here

at one of my own replays here and here

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.690 
at one of my own replays here and here
I've<00:02:11.170> spread<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.620> golems<00:02:11.980> out<00:02:12.129> all<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.610> way
