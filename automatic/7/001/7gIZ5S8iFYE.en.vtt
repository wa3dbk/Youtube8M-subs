way to introduce someone to layering as

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.669 
way to introduce someone to layering as
well<00:02:02.819> as<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.869> previous<00:02:04.200> episodes

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
well as you know in previous episodes

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.130 
well as you know in previous episodes
you<00:02:05.039> can<00:02:05.490> layer<00:02:05.759> spirits<00:02:06.390> upon<00:02:06.810> each<00:02:06.959> other

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you can layer spirits upon each other

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.509 
you can layer spirits upon each other
depending<00:02:07.289> on<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.709> heavy<00:02:07.890> each<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
depending on how heavy each one is

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.609 
depending on how heavy each one is
higher<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> alcohol<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.259> lighter<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
higher the alcohol the lighter the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
higher the alcohol the lighter the
spirit<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.099> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.459> we're<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.329> use

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
spirit is going to be we're going to use

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.930 
spirit is going to be we're going to use
the<00:02:12.540> aromatic<00:02:12.989> bitters<00:02:13.079> today<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> 45%

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the aromatic bitters today that is 45%

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.729 
the aromatic bitters today that is 45%
alcohol<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.049> be<00:02:16.140> considerably

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
alcohol so it's going to be considerably

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
alcohol so it's going to be considerably
lighter<00:02:16.920> than<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.670> sugar<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> lemon<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.510> we

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
lighter than the sugar and lemon that we

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.150 
lighter than the sugar and lemon that we
just<00:02:18.810> put<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.379> will<00:02:19.560> layer<00:02:19.860> very

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
just put in so this will layer very

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
just put in so this will layer very
easily<00:02:20.720> normally<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.870> will<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.170> showing<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
easily normally I will be showing you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.880 
easily normally I will be showing you
this<00:02:22.680> by<00:02:22.950> layering<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.900> spoon<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
this by layering it over a spoon but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.069 
this by layering it over a spoon but
because<00:02:26.099> we<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:26.459> big<00:02:26.760> flat<00:02:27.480> pieces<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
because we have these big flat pieces of

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.630 
because we have these big flat pieces of
ice<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.040> layer<00:02:29.190> over<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> ice

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
ice I can just layer over the ice

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.720 
ice I can just layer over the ice
especially<00:02:30.000> considering<00:02:30.720> how<00:02:31.379> high<00:02:32.010> alcohol

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
