00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
these bandos and I know you've probably

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
these bandos and I know you've probably
seen<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> billion<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> them<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.390> other<00:00:48.780> walls

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
seen a billion of them and other walls

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
seen a billion of them and other walls
of<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.530> LF<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.760> more<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of them from LF but this one is more of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
of them from LF but this one is more of
like<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> grayish<00:00:52.260> green<00:00:52.410> taupe<00:00:53.010> color

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
like a like a grayish green taupe color

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
like a like a grayish green taupe color
