00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 it's not with a slow game it's not with the game 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.860
 denounced that it is possible to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.230
 to disorganize or arrange to arrange 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 moment of penetration into the structure of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.699
 compact as I believe the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.789
 Estoril Sol presenting us 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.060
 therefore there is the possibility 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.070
 considered offensive strong pace 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.899
 first comes as strong a transition 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 long be good and then concentrated 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 in those moments that I already spoke 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 concentrated on the standing balls was fair 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.149
 I as a team as guests with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 with defensive organization knowing a lot 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.230
 in particular is to play against 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 the other big ones organize this well 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.620
 make the most of the moment of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.309
 offensive transition because there are players 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 fast players who have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 ordered and unbalanced in one 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 against one and enjoy and with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.320
 take advantage of the still balls 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.479
 therefore these are the arguments of these 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 of these teams I truly have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:25.619
 sense a team from the point of view 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 more more affective connected bound 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.619
 I have felt a certain age the work 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 greater and all contribute to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.869
 We are currently in one and want 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.119
 maintaining this is the main objective of this 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.290
 game built this fact the great 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:57.210
 objective is to keep in the group of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 of teams that command their 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.119
 respective groups in the fauna in the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.930
 champions but command size aspects 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.080
 large field 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.670
 jackson 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.160
 a Mr. Jackson maybe the best is 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.020
 I asked Carlos the question with you. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 I already know people that there is not much 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.300
 time has long looked to whom 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 few advances in the matter are 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.820
 surprising are a cupcake to call 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.230
 condemned sooner than they think they will 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.230
 add to our game
