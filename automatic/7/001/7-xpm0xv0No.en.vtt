00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hanau 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.039
 so should have 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.359
 I do not know 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.659
 January 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.659
 Berlin by Dr 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.159
 Round 7 food 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:20.930
 in conversation 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.019
 they acquire Momo Ildiz from 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.810
 come to us 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.319
 in total 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.720
 Overall, it easily leads off whoever drops me 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.560
 the colonel 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.760
 Minden MT Ulrich I have to think that's easy 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 she must know that basically for herself the owner next to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.970
 otherwise we are dead these settings Â»also at the end is then 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.630
 yes also peripheral locations such as place in Moscow at the end it is always 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.180
 Dr more 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.500
 and then 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 the right of withdrawal did not show 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 he chooses that is yes that will be my words basically 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.430
 and i have a lot i have i have my mouth shut 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 as a precaution talked 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 I just need to go from the bottom 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.000
 since I am anyway 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.510
 I never wanted to be guided 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.060
 percent 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.790
 because what is where to think of that has come many say year and so Nordmann 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.049
 Sachsa half-year, the European judges are likely to puzzle over 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.440
 Google 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.610
 I do not mix myself too 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030
 But I could interfere 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.900
 but I do not do it 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 but so shelf 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.780
 I am impressed there is a forum that knows the content that is for 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.300
 It was important to me that it was just what I had to say and run 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.240
 Point loss should that was not so stupid to Laber that is such a guy 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.299
 to be open to the report there is a meticulous one in it 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.740
 one percent next to set 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560
 Narayen 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.750
 flow 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 terrible this one but i really cant find anyone thats thats easy 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 Then that's how it is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.979
 in the whole thing that's me 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.929
 But that is really such an antipathy 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.939
 should the simplest ones be meaningless you are just as well in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.550
 with the sentence Demel about he had such a squatter Andechser so good 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.969
 because now and then comes the index 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.119
 or that maybe there is somehow Sony there is just as well 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.299
 stale black Laber December again 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.600
 the neighbors are in themselves 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.939
 to give them the pay or money 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.499
 well not expecting too much if i know then i would have succeeded to APA 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.389
 Dr 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.389
 when I sit my mother GM 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:47.400
 even though
