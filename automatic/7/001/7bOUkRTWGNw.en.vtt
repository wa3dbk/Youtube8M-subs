the orb oh and did you mix this up on me
while<00:00:41.649> I<00:00:41.680> wasn't<00:00:42.010> looking<00:00:42.539> alright<00:00:43.539> well<00:00:43.719> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
while I wasn't looking alright well the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740 
while I wasn't looking alright well the
orb<00:00:44.050> oh<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.500> this<00:00:44.800> little<00:00:45.190> circle<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.450> it<00:00:46.629> has

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
orb oh is this little circle and it has

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750 
orb oh is this little circle and it has
all<00:00:47.050> these<00:00:47.140> little<00:00:47.379> balls<00:00:47.559> on<00:00:48.010> there<00:00:48.520> and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
all these little balls on there and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.420 
all these little balls on there and
there's<00:00:49.180> rings<00:00:49.750> around<00:00:50.079> each<00:00:50.289> ball<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
there's rings around each ball and you

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.670 
there's rings around each ball and you
can<00:00:51.610> move<00:00:51.789> them<00:00:52.030> from<00:00:52.210> slot<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.780> slot<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.289> the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
can move them from slot to slot and the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.670 
can move them from slot to slot and the
idea<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:55.059> match<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.840> ball<00:00:56.020> with<00:00:56.469> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
idea is to match the ball with the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
idea is to match the ball with the
circle<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:59.199> can<00:00:59.410> easily<00:00:59.590> go<00:00:59.890> through<00:01:00.250> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
circle so you can easily go through and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100 
circle so you can easily go through and
go<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:03.269> put<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.360> right<00:01:04.539> ball<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:04.899> the<00:01:04.989> right

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
go and put the right ball in the right

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.920 
go and put the right ball in the right
slot<00:01:05.410> there's<00:01:05.710> always<00:01:06.009> one<00:01:06.310> open<00:01:06.940> circle<00:01:07.690> and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
slot there's always one open circle and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.219 
slot there's always one open circle and
so<00:01:08.440> there's<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.160> circle<00:01:10.000> down<00:01:10.539> here<00:01:10.929> that<00:01:11.110> has
