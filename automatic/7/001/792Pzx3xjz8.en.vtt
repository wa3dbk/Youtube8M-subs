and certain concealers being too dark

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
and certain concealers being too dark
for<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> too<00:00:44.160> light<00:00:44.430> it's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
almost white so the purpose of it is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
almost white so the purpose of it is
that<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> mix<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> two<00:00:49.410> together<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.520> can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that you mix the two together you can

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.560

that's why there's only three of these

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.270

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
as it settles into the lines and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
as it settles into the lines and
everything<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> also<00:01:51.750> melts<00:01:52.200> away<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
you get less coverage so instead of just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
you get less coverage so instead of just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
looks decent because I can't tell from

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.020 
looks decent because I can't tell from
looking<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> camera<00:02:43.190> all<00:02:44.190> right<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
looking in the camera all right so I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.330 
looking in the camera all right so I
know<00:02:45.960> I<00:02:46.080> don't<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.680> looks<00:02:46.710> really

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
know I don't know if it looks really

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.890 
know I don't know if it looks really
light<00:02:47.550> right<00:02:47.820> now<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> camera<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
light right now and in the camera I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
light right now and in the camera I
think<00:02:48.990> when<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.830> usually<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.460> concealer<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
think when I usually do my concealer I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.090 
think when I usually do my concealer I
do<00:02:51.240> my<00:02:51.360> under<00:02:51.630> eye<00:02:51.660> concealer<00:02:51.780> before<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.710> set

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
do my under eye concealer before I set

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.530 
do my under eye concealer before I set
my<00:02:53.220> makeup<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:53.670> powder<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.270> kind<00:02:54.480> of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
my makeup with powder and that kind of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.350 
my makeup with powder and that kind of
like<00:02:54.710> blends<00:02:55.710> it<00:02:55.860> all<00:02:55.920> together<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.300> don't

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
like blends it all together but I don't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600 
like blends it all together but I don't
know<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.170> tell<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> difference<00:02:59.430> right

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
know if you can tell a difference right

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.850 
know if you can tell a difference right
now<00:02:59.670> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.270> looking<00:03:00.600> like<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> little

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
now this is looking like I have a little

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
now this is looking like I have a little
bit<00:03:01.950> better<00:03:02.100> coverage<00:03:02.490> here<00:03:02.820> than<00:03:03.090> here

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
bit better coverage here than here

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.720 
bit better coverage here than here
because<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.960> has<00:03:04.020> faded<00:03:04.380> away<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.160> let<00:03:05.700> me

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
because this has faded away and let me

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.630 
because this has faded away and let me
just<00:03:05.850> show<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.210> up<00:03:06.480> close<00:03:08.540> camera<00:03:10.520> what<00:03:11.520> it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
looks like after you applied it can look

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.490 
looks like after you applied it can look
a<00:03:14.850> little<00:03:14.880> bit<00:03:15.450> cakey<00:03:17.810> see<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.170> already

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
a little bit cakey see that it's already

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.490 
a little bit cakey see that it's already
kind<00:03:19.770> of<00:03:19.860> creasing<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.370> little<00:03:20.550> bit<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:22.230> look<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
kind of creasing a little bit can look a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.560 
kind of creasing a little bit can look a
little<00:03:22.650> bit<00:03:22.920> cakey

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
little bit cakey

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.290 
little bit cakey
if<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.620> good<00:03:25.980> coverage<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
if you get good coverage of it and you

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.960 
if you get good coverage of it and you

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
know apply it and a decent amount but so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.830 
know apply it and a decent amount but so
here<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.810> here<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:35.270> do<00:03:36.270> not<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.690> this

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
here it is here and I do not like this

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.740 
here it is here and I do not like this
product<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.489> not<00:03:38.790> want<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.150> recommend<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
product I do not want to recommend it

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.830 
product I do not want to recommend it
and<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:41.370> reason<00:03:41.760> why<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:41.940> exactly<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> just

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
and the reason why is exactly I just

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080 
and the reason why is exactly I just
showed<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.709> mean<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> coverage<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:45.000> great

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
showed you I mean the coverage is great

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.870 
showed you I mean the coverage is great
but<00:03:46.080> what's<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> point<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:47.670> just

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
but what's the point of it if it's just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.660 
but what's the point of it if it's just
gonna<00:03:48.000> settle<00:03:48.420> into<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.260> lines<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.550> know

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
gonna settle into the lines and you know

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.420 
gonna settle into the lines and you know
fade<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.239> crease<00:03:51.750> on<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.080> right<00:03:52.320> away<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.890> it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
fade and crease on you right away if it

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.240 
fade and crease on you right away if it
lasted<00:03:54.120> for<00:03:54.330> at<00:03:54.390> least<00:03:54.660> maybe<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.680> couple<00:03:56.040> of

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
lasted for at least maybe a couple of

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.030 
lasted for at least maybe a couple of
hours<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.870> could<00:03:58.080> be<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.380> short-term

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
hours so this could be like a short-term

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.729 
hours so this could be like a short-term
wear<00:03:59.430> concealer<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:00.390> maybe<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.590> don't

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739

the coverage to cover it up if you try

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.770 
the coverage to cover it up if you try
and<00:04:25.530> set<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.980> powder<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.639> top<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.600> that

and set it with a powder on top of that

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.010 
and set it with a powder on top of that
then<00:04:28.169> it's<00:04:28.350> gonna<00:04:28.530> get<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:29.070> mega<00:04:29.639> cakey<00:04:30.090> so

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
that's not really an option I know

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.930 
that's not really an option I know
sometimes<00:04:33.389> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.020> set<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.590> Korean<00:04:35.400> product

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
sometimes you can set a Korean product

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.420 
sometimes you can set a Korean product
with<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.990> powder<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.560> makes<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.950> last<00:04:38.130> a

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
with it powder and that makes it last a

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.510 
with it powder and that makes it last a
little<00:04:38.610> bit<00:04:38.730> longer<00:04:38.850> about<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:41.280> was

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
little bit longer about it so this was

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.390 
little bit longer about it so this was
kind<00:04:41.730> of<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.150> big<00:04:42.540> miss<00:04:42.870> for<00:04:43.139> me<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.950> product

person where things just don't crease
underneath<00:05:15.479> your<00:05:15.660> eye<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.810> mean<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.350> have<00:05:16.620> dry

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919

skin<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:17.520> not<00:05:17.580> like<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:17.910> have<00:05:18.060> oily<00:05:18.360> skin<00:05:18.570> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
skin it's not like I have oily skin and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.990 
skin it's not like I have oily skin and
things<00:05:19.229> just<00:05:19.410> melt<00:05:19.800> off<00:05:19.950> my<00:05:20.130> face<00:05:20.340> normally
