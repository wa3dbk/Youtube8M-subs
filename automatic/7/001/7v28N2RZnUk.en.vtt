plenty<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.940> light<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.360> there<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:44.270> it's<00:02:45.270> about

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
plenty of light in there and it's about

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.820 
plenty of light in there and it's about
300<00:02:46.440> bucks

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
300 bucks

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.500 
300 bucks
I<00:02:47.010> believe<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.460> find<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:47.850> about<00:02:48.030> 300

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
I believe you can find it for about 300

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.330 
I believe you can find it for about 300
bucks<00:02:48.660> rockin<00:02:49.320> on<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.190> also

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
bucks rockin on I think that it also

actually<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.680> don't<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.160> any

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
actually because I don't have any

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.320 
actually because I don't have any
autofocus<00:03:00.060> lenses<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.030> manual

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
autofocus lenses but I just like manual

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.350 
autofocus lenses but I just like manual
focus<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.930> into<00:03:04.230> video<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.920> well<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:06.120> like

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
focus I'm into video as well so I like

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600 
focus I'm into video as well so I like
to<00:03:06.570> use<00:03:07.020> manual<00:03:07.290> focus<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.190> for

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
to use manual focus a lot because for

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.750 
to use manual focus a lot because for
video<00:03:09.050> that's<00:03:10.050> all<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.320> use<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.310> helps

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
video that's all I use and it helps

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.320 
video that's all I use and it helps
practice<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.190> feel<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.730> adds

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
practice and it just I feel like it adds

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380 
practice and it just I feel like it adds
a<00:03:15.600> little<00:03:15.780> more<00:03:16.640> feeling<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:18.000> some<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.300> my

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
a little more feeling to some of my

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.660 
a little more feeling to some of my
pictures<00:03:18.840> because<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.860> not<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.520> it's

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
pictures because it's just not that it's

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.670 
pictures because it's just not that it's
more<00:03:20.910> work<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.660> more<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.530> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
more work but it's more you have to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.130 
more work but it's more you have to
concentrate<00:03:23.400> more<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:24.120> know<00:03:24.900> what

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
concentrate more and really know what

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.680 
concentrate more and really know what
you're<00:03:25.350> focusing<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.180> autofocus<00:03:27.180> lenses<00:03:27.540> are

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you're focusing on autofocus lenses are

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.630 
you're focusing on autofocus lenses are
great<00:03:27.720> too<00:03:28.230> I'm<00:03:28.530> planning<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.070> getting<00:03:29.310> one

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
great too I'm planning on getting one

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.300 
great too I'm planning on getting one
because<00:03:29.820> sometimes<00:03:30.510> those<00:03:30.989> moments<00:03:31.320> split

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
because sometimes those moments split

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.130 
because sometimes those moments split
second<00:03:32.820> where<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.270> can't<00:03:33.510> grab<00:03:33.840> nail

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
second where you just can't grab nail

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.640 
second where you just can't grab nail
focus<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.730> miss<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.090> shot<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:36.690> autofocus

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
focus and you miss the shot so autofocus

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.590 
focus and you miss the shot so autofocus
lenses<00:03:38.040> are<00:03:38.220> great<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.670> sports<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.420> lot<00:03:39.570> of

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
lenses are great for sports and a lot of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.590 
lenses are great for sports and a lot of
action<00:03:39.900> fast-paced<00:03:40.860> movement<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.270> lens

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
action fast-paced movement but this lens

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.140 
action fast-paced movement but this lens
actually<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.440> good<00:03:43.800> lens<00:03:43.980> because<00:03:44.489> since

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
actually is a good lens because since

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.350 
actually is a good lens because since
it's<00:03:45.300> such<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> wide<00:03:45.840> angle<00:03:46.110> even<00:03:46.530> at<00:03:46.830> F<00:03:46.980> 2.8<00:03:47.640> I'm

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
it's such a wide angle even at F 2.8 I'm

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.729 
it's such a wide angle even at F 2.8 I'm
going<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:48.780> show<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.019> I'm<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.530> D

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
focus I'm going to go to my closest

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.380

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
about it will be out of focus but not by

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.610 
about it will be out of focus but not by
much<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.690> let<00:03:57.989> me<00:03:58.080> just<00:03:58.110> show<00:03:58.440> you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.509 

all<00:04:01.549> right<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.090> that's<00:04:02.590> closest<00:04:03.590> focus<00:04:04.099> it

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
all right and that's closest focus it

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.059 
all right and that's closest focus it
says<00:04:04.700> point<00:04:05.090> three<00:04:05.480> meters<00:04:06.349> I<00:04:06.500> guess<00:04:06.709> about<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
says point three meters I guess about a

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.259 
says point three meters I guess about a
foot<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.170> yeah<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.040> can<00:04:10.159> see<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.670> even

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
foot and yeah so as you can see and even

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.110 
foot and yeah so as you can see and even
if<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.629> just<00:04:11.930> let<00:04:12.440> me<00:04:12.530> put<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.069> point<00:04:13.610> zero

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
if I just let me put it to point zero

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.090 
if I just let me put it to point zero
four<00:04:14.450> point<00:04:15.140> four<00:04:15.409> meters<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.590> you'll<00:04:18.889> see

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
four point four meters and you'll see

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.230 
four point four meters and you'll see
there<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.419> picture<00:04:20.900> also<00:04:22.000> looks<00:04:23.000> pretty

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
there that the picture also looks pretty

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.870 
there that the picture also looks pretty
much<00:04:23.389> in<00:04:23.570> focus<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:23.979> unless<00:04:24.979> if<00:04:25.190> something<00:04:25.639> is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
much in focus so unless if something is

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.120 
much in focus so unless if something is
really<00:04:26.120> close<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.590> be<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.770> really

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
really close you have to be a really

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.219 
really close you have to be a really
close<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.729> really<00:04:28.970> get<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.360> depth<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.930> field

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
close to really get that depth of field

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.650 
close to really get that depth of field
in<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.680> lens<00:04:31.070> but<00:04:31.520> that's<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.389> good<00:04:32.510> thing

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
in this lens but that's the good thing

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.710 
in this lens but that's the good thing
about<00:04:32.690> wide-angle<00:04:33.530> lenses<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.479> maybe<00:04:35.479> when

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
about wide-angle lenses so maybe when

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.420 
about wide-angle lenses so maybe when
I'm<00:04:35.840> longboarding<00:04:36.470> sometimes<00:04:37.039> this<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.400> a

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
I'm longboarding sometimes this is a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.430 
I'm longboarding sometimes this is a
good<00:04:37.639> lens<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.120> use<00:04:38.330> if<00:04:38.600> I'm<00:04:38.750> longboarding<00:04:39.320> I

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
good lens to use if I'm longboarding I

just want to capture anything that I see

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.540 
just want to capture anything that I see

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
really quick BAM don't have to worry

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.310 
really quick BAM don't have to worry
about<00:04:43.610> grabbing<00:04:44.000> focus<00:04:44.630> or<00:04:44.780> anything<00:04:44.990> just

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
about grabbing focus or anything just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.590 
about grabbing focus or anything just
takes<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.680> picture<00:04:45.860> snap<00:04:46.729> it<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.060> leave<00:04:47.300> the

takes a picture snap it I leave the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.540 
takes a picture snap it I leave the
focus<00:04:48.050> pretty<00:04:48.770> much<00:04:48.949> usually<00:04:49.340> set<00:04:49.520> to

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
focus pretty much usually set to

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.790 
focus pretty much usually set to
infinity<00:04:50.240> because<00:04:50.870> things<00:04:51.229> are<00:04:51.440> usually

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
infinity because things are usually

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.409 
infinity because things are usually
further<00:04:52.310> away<00:04:52.580> from<00:04:52.610> me<00:04:52.940> when<00:04:53.090> I'm<00:04:53.180> taking

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
further away from me when I'm taking

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.230 
further away from me when I'm taking
pictures<00:04:53.949> with<00:04:54.949> this<00:04:55.100> lens<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.699> longboard

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
and this little little mini tree with a

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.589 
and this little little mini tree with a
spiderweb<00:05:28.190> on<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:28.820> let's<00:05:29.000> see<00:05:29.210> if<00:05:29.330> we<00:05:29.389> can

spiderweb on it so let's see if we can
get<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.810> spider<00:05:30.110> web

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.790 

all<00:05:44.830> right<00:05:45.100> there<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.580> go<00:05:45.790> so<00:05:46.230> yeah<00:05:47.230> that's<00:05:47.530> uh

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
all right there you go so yeah that's uh

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.040 
all right there you go so yeah that's uh
just<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:48.550> little<00:05:48.760> demonstration<00:05:48.910> not<00:05:49.630> really<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
just a little demonstration not really a

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.770 
just a little demonstration not really a
huge<00:05:50.890> amount<00:05:51.160> of<00:05:51.250> depth<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.550> field<00:05:51.820> I'm<00:05:51.970> at<00:05:52.120> 2.8

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
huge amount of depth of field I'm at 2.8

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.900 
huge amount of depth of field I'm at 2.8
the<00:05:53.050> lowest<00:05:53.410> aperture<00:05:53.890> you<00:05:54.010> can<00:05:54.190> go<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.640> I<00:05:54.730> was

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
the lowest aperture you can go and I was

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.530 
the lowest aperture you can go and I was
at<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.150> point<00:05:55.600> three<00:05:55.870> meters<00:05:56.730> really<00:05:57.730> no<00:05:57.940> not

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
at a point three meters really no not

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.210 
at a point three meters really no not
too<00:05:58.690> much<00:05:58.720> depth<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.230> field<00:05:59.410> but<00:05:59.560> you<00:05:59.590> can<00:05:59.890> see

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
too much depth of field but you can see

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.860 
too much depth of field but you can see
that<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.550> background<00:06:00.760> is<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.210> little<00:06:01.750> more

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
that the background is a little more

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.670 
that the background is a little more
blurry<00:06:02.260> than<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.680> foreground<00:06:03.100> so<00:06:04.200> all<00:06:05.200> in<00:06:05.560> all

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
blurry than the foreground so all in all

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.460 
blurry than the foreground so all in all
is<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.670> worth<00:06:06.820> 300<00:06:07.270> bucks<00:06:07.300> hell<00:06:07.930> yes

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
is it worth 300 bucks hell yes

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.830 
is it worth 300 bucks hell yes
it's<00:06:08.680> definitely<00:06:09.310> worth<00:06:09.460> 300<00:06:09.940> bucks<00:06:09.970> the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
it's definitely worth 300 bucks the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.990 
it's definitely worth 300 bucks the
great<00:06:11.140> lens<00:06:11.410> just<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.860> have<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.100> mean<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.550> use<00:06:12.820> it

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
great lens just to have I mean I use it

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.140 
great lens just to have I mean I use it
a<00:06:13.090> lot<00:06:13.500> but<00:06:14.500> if<00:06:14.680> you<00:06:15.040> if<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.580> really<00:06:15.880> want<00:06:16.060> to

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
a lot but if you if you really want to

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.850 
a lot but if you if you really want to
get<00:06:16.270> sometimes<00:06:16.630> that<00:06:17.110> certain<00:06:17.440> look<00:06:17.620> it's

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
get sometimes that certain look it's

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.670 
get sometimes that certain look it's
great<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:19.780> yeah<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.170> comes<00:06:20.500> in

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
great and so yeah this comes in

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.320 
great and so yeah this comes in
different<00:06:20.920> mounts<00:06:21.430> as<00:06:21.550> well<00:06:21.760> I<00:06:21.790> think<00:06:22.030> you<00:06:22.240> can

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
different mounts as well I think you can

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.020 
different mounts as well I think you can
get<00:06:22.420> in<00:06:22.540> next<00:06:23.020> mount<00:06:23.700> there's<00:06:24.700> a<00:06:24.760> whole<00:06:24.910> bunch

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
get in next mount there's a whole bunch

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.630 
get in next mount there's a whole bunch
of<00:06:25.180> fish<00:06:25.450> eyes<00:06:25.720> around<00:06:26.470> the<00:06:26.770> 300<00:06:27.010> dollar<00:06:27.340> price

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
of fish eyes around the 300 dollar price

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.430 
of fish eyes around the 300 dollar price
range<00:06:27.670> you<00:06:28.090> can<00:06:28.180> probably<00:06:28.420> pretty<00:06:28.990> much<00:06:29.080> get

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
range you can probably pretty much get

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.190 
range you can probably pretty much get
for<00:06:29.620> any<00:06:29.830> mount<00:06:30.190> out<00:06:30.910> there<00:06:31.330> all<00:06:31.810> made<00:06:32.020> by

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
for any mount out there all made by

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.460 
for any mount out there all made by
rocking<00:06:32.770> on<00:06:32.890> Bauer<00:06:33.220> and<00:06:33.640> all<00:06:33.790> those<00:06:34.470> Panasonic

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
rocking on Bauer and all those Panasonic

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.190 
rocking on Bauer and all those Panasonic
makes<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.860> few<00:06:36.330> for<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.420> micro<00:06:37.720> four-thirds

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
makes a few for the micro four-thirds

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.920 
makes a few for the micro four-thirds
but<00:06:38.500> they're<00:06:38.650> I<00:06:38.680> think<00:06:38.920> seven<00:06:39.220> point<00:06:39.430> five

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
but they're I think seven point five

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.740 
but they're I think seven point five
just<00:06:40.930> because<00:06:41.200> it's<00:06:41.380> a<00:06:41.440> smaller<00:06:41.970> sensor<00:06:42.970> but

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
just because it's a smaller sensor but
