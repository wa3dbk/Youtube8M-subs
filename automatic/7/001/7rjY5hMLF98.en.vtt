so there it's dead and usually the first
time<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.530> battle<00:03:31.710> Oh<00:03:32.160> be<00:03:32.370> like<00:03:32.580> level<00:03:32.880> 35<00:03:33.330> so

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
time you battle Oh be like level 35 so

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.190 
time you battle Oh be like level 35 so
you're<00:03:33.840> only<00:03:33.930> getting<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:35.720> 18,000<00:03:36.720> coins

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
you're only getting like 18,000 coins

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.450 
you're only getting like 18,000 coins
but<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.620> sends<00:03:37.950> mine

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
but it sends mine

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.690 
but it sends mine
the<00:03:39.240> chatot<00:03:39.750> leveled<00:03:40.530> up<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.890> 61<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> get

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the chatot leveled up to the 61 I get

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.170 
the chatot leveled up to the 61 I get
24,000<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.410> after<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.890> walk<00:03:44.430> 100<00:03:44.970> steps

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
24,000 so after that you walk 100 steps

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:57.290 
24,000 so after that you walk 100 steps
to<00:03:45.690> recharge<00:03:46.200> your<00:03:46.380> our<00:03:46.650> secret<00:03:47.070> battery<00:03:56.300> and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.040 
to recharge your our secret battery and
I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> should<00:03:58.410> be<00:03:58.470> good<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:58.980> and<00:04:00.050> then

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
I think that should be good and and then

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.780 
I think that should be good and and then
you<00:04:01.170> come<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:01.410> here<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:01.980> use<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.640> first
