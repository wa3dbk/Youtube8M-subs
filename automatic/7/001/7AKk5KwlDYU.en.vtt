00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
boiler structure tent called my boiler

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.800 
boiler structure tent called my boiler
house<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.920> shelter<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.300> could<00:00:30.510> run<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
don't want to get the camera wet
I<00:00:52.219> threw<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.280> insulation<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> pipes

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I threw some insulation on the pipes

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.860 
I threw some insulation on the pipes
which<00:00:55.260> used<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.610> hanging<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.660> there

here<00:01:05.549> haven't<00:01:06.000> yet<00:01:06.810> dug<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.060> channel<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> bury

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
here haven't yet dug the channel to bury

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.800 
here haven't yet dug the channel to bury
them<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> ground<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:12.360> boilers

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
them in the ground and the boilers

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
them in the ground and the boilers
running<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:16.290> steam<00:01:17.009> coming<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> top

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
running that steam coming out of the top

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
running that steam coming out of the top
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> boiler<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.740> smoke<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:23.689> running

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
of the boiler not smoke so it's running

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.080 
of the boiler not smoke so it's running
great

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
great

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.039 
great
burning<00:01:26.450> clean<00:01:28.359> Muncie<00:01:29.359> I'll<00:01:29.479> go<00:01:29.659> around<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
burning clean Muncie I'll go around the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.709 
burning clean Muncie I'll go around the
other<00:01:30.170> side<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:31.520> that'll<00:01:31.729> show<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:37.719> new

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
other side and that'll show the new

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.760 
other side and that'll show the new
reservoir<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.859> I<00:01:40.689> don't<00:01:41.689> have<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:42.079> completely

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
reservoir so I don't have it completely

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.580 
reservoir so I don't have it completely
finished<00:01:43.189> yet<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.209> got<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:46.219> lair<00:01:46.549> of<00:01:47.590> our

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
finished yet but I got the lair of our

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.809 
finished yet but I got the lair of our
13<00:01:49.399> insulation<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.600> 2x4<00:01:51.259> studs<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:52.189> are

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
13 insulation in the 2x4 studs that are

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.959 
13 insulation in the 2x4 studs that are
the<00:01:53.329> vertical<00:01:53.840> wall<00:01:54.109> supports<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.369> then<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
the vertical wall supports and then I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.940 
the vertical wall supports and then I
put<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:57.759> nine<00:01:58.759> inch<00:01:59.030> layer<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.950> inflation

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
put a nine inch layer of inflation

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.460 
put a nine inch layer of inflation
around<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> outside<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.849> that<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.329> still<00:02:03.289> need

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.270 
around the outside of that I still need
to<00:02:03.770> zip<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.429> up<00:02:04.489> and<00:02:05.289> then<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:06.619> laid<00:02:06.920> some

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
to zip that up and then I just laid some

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.780 
to zip that up and then I just laid some
two<00:02:07.549> by<00:02:07.729> sixes<00:02:08.440> over<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.910> top<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:10.940> the

and dry and everything is running well
here's<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:34.080> woodchip<00:02:35.080> beach<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.980> running

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.050 

or<00:02:39.439> oh<00:02:40.459> maybe<00:02:41.459> an<00:02:41.700> hour<00:02:41.849> now

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:59.840 

you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.390> hear<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.959> dropping<00:02:46.470> ships

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.990 

looking<00:03:00.690> down<00:03:00.990> through<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.000> woodchip

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
looking down through the woodchip

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.980 
looking down through the woodchip
feature<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:07.700> again<00:03:08.700> that's<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.360> gear<00:03:09.780> motor

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
feature and again that's the gear motor

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.309 
feature and again that's the gear motor
with<00:03:10.380> speed<00:03:10.680> reducer<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.470> see

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.649 

that's<00:03:17.950> how<00:03:18.219> fast<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.849> deer<00:03:19.120> motor<00:03:19.390> is

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
that's how fast the deer motor is

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.370 
that's how fast the deer motor is
turning<00:03:20.909> and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
turning and

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.990 
turning and
you<00:03:23.800> really<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:26.020> have<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.470> watch<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.950> while<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
you really you have to watch a while to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.250 
you really you have to watch a while to
see<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.480> actual

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.390 

auger<00:03:33.300> staff<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.709> turning<00:03:36.159> about

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
I put the ladder there to keep the part

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.030 
I put the ladder there to keep the part
out<00:03:57.670> away<00:03:58.090> from<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.629> heat<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.349> I<00:03:59.620> put<00:03:59.890> that

out away from the heat and I put that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.680 
out away from the heat and I put that
just<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.150> hunk<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:02.280> sheet<00:04:03.280> metal<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.329> guy<00:04:04.629> just

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
just a hunk of sheet metal this guy just

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.670 
just a hunk of sheet metal this guy just
reflect<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:07.060> hottest<00:04:07.480> gases<00:04:07.989> when<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.319> have

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
reflect the hottest gases when I have

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.949 
reflect the hottest gases when I have
the<00:04:09.040> top<00:04:09.459> open<00:04:10.030> they<00:04:10.870> have<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:12.660> lid<00:04:13.660> right

there that I can open up when I'm
starting<00:04:16.900> up<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.560> don't<00:04:17.620> push<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.400> start<00:04:19.209> up

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
starting up I don't push the start up

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:27.870 
starting up I don't push the start up
smoke<00:04:19.720> grooving<00:04:20.729> boiler<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:25.320> then<00:04:26.880> what's

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
smoke grooving boiler and then what's

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.260 
smoke grooving boiler and then what's
going<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.360> happen<00:04:30.539> in<00:04:31.539> a<00:04:31.660> while<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:35.380> will

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
going to happen in a while is I will

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.820 
going to happen in a while is I will
tear<00:04:37.270> down<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.349> this<00:04:39.750> wood<00:04:40.750> structure

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
tear down all of this wood structure

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.089 
tear down all of this wood structure
and<00:04:42.949> rebuild<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.060> burner<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.900> put<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> new

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
and rebuild the burner and put a new

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.450 
and rebuild the burner and put a new
higher<00:04:46.490> pressure<00:04:47.139> boiler<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:49.400> for<00:04:50.090> turbine

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
higher pressure boiler in for turbine

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.559 
higher pressure boiler in for turbine
experiments<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.610> I'll<00:04:52.699> be<00:04:52.849> doing<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.449> now<00:04:53.539> I

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
experiments that I'll be doing and now I

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.409 
experiments that I'll be doing and now I
have<00:04:53.900> this<00:04:54.080> nice<00:04:54.379> big<00:04:55.210> experiment<00:04:56.210> room

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
have this nice big experiment room

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.730 
have this nice big experiment room
basically<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.720> all<00:04:59.960> of<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.229> will<00:05:00.470> tear

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
basically and so all of this will tear

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.399 
basically and so all of this will tear
down<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> boiler<00:05:01.789> will<00:05:01.970> move<00:05:02.150> inside<00:05:02.900> the

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
down and the boiler will move inside the

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.140 
down and the boiler will move inside the
can<00:05:04.310> kind<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:06.099> middle<00:05:07.099> of<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.520> Bay

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
can kind of to the middle of this Bay

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.300 
can kind of to the middle of this Bay
here

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
here

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.600 
here
so<00:05:10.310> then<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.610> want<00:05:10.819> to<00:05:10.940> have<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:12.220> do<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.400> Mickey

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
so then I want to have to do the Mickey

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.959 
so then I want to have to do the Mickey
Mouse<00:05:13.819> ladder<00:05:14.539> trick<00:05:15.310> with<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.460> tarp<00:05:16.759> because

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
Mouse ladder trick with the tarp because

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.529 
Mouse ladder trick with the tarp because
the<00:05:17.210> boiler<00:05:17.419> will<00:05:18.169> be<00:05:18.639> centers<00:05:19.639> more<00:05:19.969> in<00:05:20.419> the

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
the boiler will be centers more in the

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.939 
the boiler will be centers more in the
room<00:05:20.719> and<00:05:21.370> then<00:05:22.569> this<00:05:23.569> will<00:05:23.750> be<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.229> turbine

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
room and then this will be the turbine

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.450 
room and then this will be the turbine
laboratory<00:05:25.819> for<00:05:26.770> developing<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.949> turbines

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
laboratory for developing the turbines

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.619 
laboratory for developing the turbines
and<00:05:29.139> getting<00:05:30.139> things<00:05:30.319> going<00:05:31.030> so<00:05:32.030> that's<00:05:32.180> a

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
and getting things going so that's a

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.420 
and getting things going so that's a
little<00:05:33.319> update<00:05:33.979> for<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.550> time<00:05:34.819> being

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
little update for the time being

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.700 
little update for the time being
everything's<00:05:37.599> going<00:05:38.599> great<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.289> it's<00:05:39.440> really

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
everything's going great and it's really

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.469 
everything's going great and it's really
nice<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.250> be<00:05:40.340> able<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.729> stand<00:05:41.150> up<00:05:41.419> here<00:05:41.659> this

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
nice to be able to stand up here this

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.769 
nice to be able to stand up here this
now<00:05:44.479> I<00:05:44.509> can<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:45.610> reach<00:05:46.610> up<00:05:46.909> here<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.300> hook

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:47.779 
now I can just reach up here and hook

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.800 
now I can just reach up here and hook
the<00:05:47.990> tarps<00:05:48.349> up<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.949> I<00:05:49.219> hooked<00:05:50.180> it<00:05:50.300> up<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:50.779> that

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
the tarps up and I hooked it up so that

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.890 
the tarps up and I hooked it up so that
I<00:05:51.080> have<00:05:51.620> plenty<00:05:52.580> of<00:05:52.699> airflow<00:05:53.000> coming<00:05:53.539> through

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.600 

but<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:57.930> can<00:05:58.199> do<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.560> by<00:05:58.770> just<00:05:58.800> walking<00:05:59.490> up

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
but I can do that by just walking up

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.360 
but I can do that by just walking up
rather<00:05:59.850> than<00:05:59.970> working<00:06:00.240> off<00:06:00.510> of<00:06:00.690> ladders<00:06:01.370> and

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
rather than working off of ladders and

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.969 
rather than working off of ladders and
that's<00:06:02.520> 12<00:06:03.000> feet<00:06:03.389> off<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.630> ground<00:06:04.139> there<00:06:04.620> and

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
that's 12 feet off the ground there and

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.890 
that's 12 feet off the ground there and
the<00:06:05.160> group<00:06:05.520> is<00:06:05.820> about<00:06:07.160> another<00:06:08.330> 8<00:06:09.330> feet<00:06:09.389> so

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
the group is about another 8 feet so

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.680 
the group is about another 8 feet so
it's<00:06:10.050> about<00:06:10.199> 20<00:06:10.530> feet<00:06:11.040> to<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.580> peak<00:06:11.910> of<00:06:12.240> the

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
it's about 20 feet to the peak of the

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.340 
it's about 20 feet to the peak of the
roof<00:06:12.889> and<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.880> room<00:06:15.090> is<00:06:15.300> about<00:06:16.310> 20<00:06:17.310> feet<00:06:17.340> by<00:06:18.350> 18

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
roof and the room is about 20 feet by 18

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.840 
roof and the room is about 20 feet by 18
feet<00:06:20.010> or<00:06:20.340> so<00:06:20.550> QuickTrim<00:06:21.979> so<00:06:22.979> that's<00:06:23.160> that's

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
feet or so QuickTrim so that's that's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.870 
feet or so QuickTrim so that's that's
what's<00:06:24.270> up<00:06:24.479> for<00:06:24.750> now
