00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
I'm getting fairly low on health at this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.470 
I'm getting fairly low on health at this
point<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.579> was<00:02:24.700> pretty<00:02:24.819> desperate<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.299> pick

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
point so I was pretty desperate to pick

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.119 
point so I was pretty desperate to pick
up<00:02:25.599> this<00:02:25.719> normal<00:02:26.109> colored<00:02:26.379> Superman<00:02:26.859> symbol

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
up this normal colored Superman symbol

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.830 
up this normal colored Superman symbol
which<00:02:27.700> obviously<00:02:27.999> restores<00:02:28.450> some<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.719> your

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
which obviously restores some of your

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
which obviously restores some of your
health<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.379> was<00:02:29.920> still<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.159> little<00:02:30.400> low<00:02:30.549> though

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
health I was still a little low though

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.009 
health I was still a little low though
so<00:02:30.999> I<00:02:31.030> figured<00:02:31.359> I'd<00:02:31.450> slide<00:02:31.629> all<00:02:31.719> the<00:02:31.749> way<00:02:31.840> back

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
so I figured I'd slide all the way back

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.569 
so I figured I'd slide all the way back
to<00:02:32.170> nearly<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.560> star<00:02:32.859> to<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.129> level<00:02:33.400> where<00:02:33.519> I

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
to nearly the star to the level where I

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.920 
to nearly the star to the level where I
remember<00:02:33.999> there<00:02:34.120> being<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.359> static<00:02:34.749> health

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930

pickup waiting for me you can actually

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.949 
spare me your vision to slow the game
down<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.639> a<00:03:00.669> viable<00:03:00.879> tactic<00:03:01.449> but<00:03:01.689> the<00:03:01.810> way<00:03:01.900> you

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
down is a viable tactic but the way you

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.599 
down is a viable tactic but the way you
can<00:03:02.199> actually<00:03:02.349> laser<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.010> coins<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.579> well

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
can actually laser the coins as well

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
to continue every level so you can just

platform<00:04:43.690> but<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.260> decided<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.800> go<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.070> long

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
platform but I decided to go the long

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.790 
platform but I decided to go the long
way<00:04:45.340> around<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.870> was<00:04:46.990> mainly<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.470> try<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
way around that was mainly to try and

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.470 
way around that was mainly to try and
find<00:04:47.950> some<00:04:48.160> more<00:04:48.220> power-ups<00:04:48.730> before<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.270> boss

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
find some more power-ups before the boss

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.820 
find some more power-ups before the boss
