00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the vapor fly vapor carbon fly cleats

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.660 
the vapor fly vapor carbon fly cleats
now<00:00:12.420> these<00:00:12.660> cleats<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.440> around<00:00:13.679> $150<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
now these cleats are around $150 and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.829 
now these cleats are around $150 and
I'll<00:00:14.759> get<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> minute<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.630> they're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
so expensive

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.189 
so expensive
first<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.580> size<00:00:18.240> 12<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.750> feet<00:00:18.990> I'm

first of all size 12 for my feet I'm

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
first of all size 12 for my feet I'm
gonna<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.590> over<00:00:19.650> some<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> benefits<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
gonna go over some of the benefits of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.460 
gonna go over some of the benefits of
these<00:00:20.699> cleats<00:00:20.939> compared<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> others<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
these cleats compared to others which is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.550 
these cleats compared to others which is
why<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:26.150> my<00:00:27.150> code<00:00:27.720> Pro<00:00:27.990> cleats<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.470> as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
why I have my code Pro cleats here as

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
why I have my code Pro cleats here as
well<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.160> well<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.179> both<00:00:30.390> these

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
well and all over well I use both these

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
well and all over well I use both these
pairs<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> leads<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.230> different<00:00:31.619> scenarios

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
pairs of leads for different scenarios

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.610 
pairs of leads for different scenarios
so<00:00:32.250> first<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.840> cleats<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.380> around

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so first of all these cleats for around

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
so first of all these cleats for around
$150<00:00:35.450> these<00:00:36.450> ones<00:00:36.770> were<00:00:37.770> around<00:00:38.480> $90<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
$150 these ones were around $90 and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
$150 these ones were around $90 and
these<00:00:40.320> ones<00:00:40.530> used<00:00:40.770> spikes<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.430> see

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
these ones used spikes as you can see

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
these ones used spikes as you can see
and<00:00:42.510> these<00:00:43.410> ones<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.370> studs<00:00:45.230> molded

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and these ones are just studs molded

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.580 
and these ones are just studs molded
studs

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
studs

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350 
studs
and<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> benefits

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and I'll go over some of the benefits

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
and I'll go over some of the benefits
and<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> kind<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> stuff<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.460> first<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> all

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and that kind of stuff so first of all

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.660 
and that kind of stuff so first of all
as<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:52.410> aren't<00:00:52.620> stock<00:00:53.280> laces

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
as you can see these aren't stock laces

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
as you can see these aren't stock laces
I<00:00:53.760> put<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.210> myself<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> give<00:00:55.140> them

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I put these in myself just to give them

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
I put these in myself just to give them
so<00:00:55.379> they're<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.760> cold

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
so they're a little bit on my cold

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.779 
so they're a little bit on my cold
colors<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.930> ones<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.289> left

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
colors and these ones I just left

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
colors and these ones I just left
because<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.090> believe<00:01:00.390> before<00:01:00.600> practice<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
because I believe before practice and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
because I believe before practice and
the<00:01:01.590> reason<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.890> only<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.309> practice

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the reason I only use them for practice

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.560 
the reason I only use them for practice
it<00:01:03.480> goes<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.229> bad<00:01:04.350> field<00:01:05.570> studs

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it goes with my really bad field studs

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
it goes with my really bad field studs
they're<00:01:06.720> an<00:01:06.780> essential<00:01:07.229> thing<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> can

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.109 
they're an essential thing so you can
dig<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> ground<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> mean<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
dig in the ground as long I mean you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
dig in the ground as long I mean you
want<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.650> cuz<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and light cleats and they're low-cut

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.749 
and light cleats and they're low-cut

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.410 
heavy bulky cleats for when you're
working<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.549> sprint<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.149> stuff<00:01:45.299> like

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
working on sprint out and stuff like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
working on sprint out and stuff like
that<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.899> poles<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> stuff<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that and poles and that kind of stuff so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.190 
that and poles and that kind of stuff so
that's<00:01:48.299> why<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.780> four<00:01:49.020> games

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's why I like these four games

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
that's why I like these four games
compared<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
compared to these now some of the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.109 
compared to these now some of the
benefits<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> these<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.759> padding<00:01:54.060> in

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
benefits one of these is the padding in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.200 
benefits one of these is the padding in
the<00:01:54.210> back<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:56.909> I'm<00:01:57.119> not

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the back so you can see in there I'm not

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.550 
the back so you can see in there I'm not
quite<00:01:57.479> sure<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.630> we'll<00:01:57.780> focus<00:01:58.110> right<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.320> here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
quite sure if we'll focus right in here

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
quite sure if we'll focus right in here
here<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.100> super<00:01:59.460> padded<00:01:59.820> what<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
here it's super padded what you really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
here it's super padded what you really
like<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.259> ankle<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> feels<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
like on your ankle it feels really

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.700 
like on your ankle it feels really
comfortable<00:02:02.840> while<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:04.079> cleats

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
comfortable while these cleats

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
comfortable while these cleats
they<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.509> no<00:02:06.509> padding<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.049> ankle<00:02:07.290> at

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
they have no padding on your ankle at

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.550 
they have no padding on your ankle at
all<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.750> problem<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
all which is a problem with them and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
all which is a problem with them and
I'll<00:02:10.649> go<00:02:10.830> over<00:02:11.009> why<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> switched<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.300> these

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I'll go over why I switched to these

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.199 
I'll go over why I switched to these
he<00:02:13.019> sees<00:02:13.230> don't<00:02:13.650> look<00:02:13.769> super<00:02:14.069> used<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> have

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
he sees don't look super used so I have

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.690 
he sees don't look super used so I have
had<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.569> super<00:02:15.900> long<00:02:16.050> now<00:02:16.920> these<00:02:17.489> ones

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
had it for super long now these ones

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.900 
had it for super long now these ones
another<00:02:18.060> problem<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:18.540> though<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
another problem with these though is the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.830 
another problem with these though is the
arch<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.540> removable<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.500> these<00:02:22.620> ones<00:02:22.860> I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
arch is not removable so in these ones I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.770 
arch is not removable so in these ones I
put<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.470> my<00:02:25.650> extra<00:02:25.890> pair<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.569> my<00:02:27.569> arch

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
put in just my extra pair of my arch

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
put in just my extra pair of my arch
supports<00:02:28.170> because<00:02:28.349> I've<00:02:28.440> fluffy<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> lot

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
supports because I've fluffy like a lot

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
supports because I've fluffy like a lot
of<00:02:29.730> line<00:02:29.849> out<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.269> well<00:02:31.019> wear<00:02:31.440> these<00:02:31.739> ones

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
of line out there well wear these ones

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250 
of line out there well wear these ones
you<00:02:32.700> cannot<00:02:33.000> pull<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.690> no<00:02:33.870> matter<00:02:34.019> how

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you cannot pull these out no matter how

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.449 
you cannot pull these out no matter how
hard<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> try<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:36.420> problem<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.349> these<00:02:38.310> are

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
hard you try that's problem so these are

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.339 
hard you try that's problem so these are
so<00:02:38.580> expensive<00:02:38.819> because<00:02:39.150> these<00:02:39.900> are<00:02:40.049> custom

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
so expensive because these are custom

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.559 
so expensive because these are custom

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
difference on putting onto these prayers

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360 
difference on putting onto these prayers
of<00:03:32.310> cleats<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:34.049> how<00:03:34.380> they<00:03:34.560> differ<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.889> how

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
of cleats and how they differ and how

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.460 
of cleats and how they differ and how
they're<00:03:35.579> better<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.209> worse<00:03:38.180> okay<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.170> here

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
they're better and worse okay so here

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.520 
they're better and worse okay so here
have<00:03:41.120> practice<00:03:42.120> soft<00:03:42.480> practice<00:03:42.900> cleat<00:03:43.109> game

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
have practice soft practice cleat game

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.220 
have practice soft practice cleat game
soft<00:03:43.799> game<00:03:44.040> cleat<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:45.660> these<00:03:45.780> Mexico

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
soft game cleat so with these Mexico

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.349 
soft game cleat so with these Mexico
pros<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.889> simply<00:03:47.220> take<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:49.560> put<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.799> on

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
pros you simply take it you put it on

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.289 
pros you simply take it you put it on
like<00:03:51.359> any<00:03:51.630> wall<00:03:52.349> cleat<00:03:52.819> just<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.060> on

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
like any wall cleat just like that on

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.379 
like any wall cleat just like that on
titan<00:03:55.230> lace<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.530> good<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.829> go<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.459> with<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
titan lace is good to go but with the

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.050 
titan lace is good to go but with the
vapor<00:03:57.900> carbons<00:03:58.410> that's<00:03:59.400> such<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> big<00:03:59.790> loop

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
vapor carbons that's such a big loop

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.360 
vapor carbons that's such a big loop
because<00:04:00.690> since<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.139> tight<00:04:01.349> like<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.739> see

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
because since it's tight like that see

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670 
because since it's tight like that see
how<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.549> elastic<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.209> not<00:04:03.389> different<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
how it's elastic it's not different the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.539 
how it's elastic it's not different the
tongues<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:05.010> part<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.280> it

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
tongues a part of it

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.610 
tongues a part of it
they<00:04:06.510> can<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> more<00:04:06.959> difficult<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.380> get<00:04:07.470> on

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
they can be a more difficult to get on

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.339 
they can be a more difficult to get on
which<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.190> why<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.549> wear<00:04:08.669> a<00:04:09.349> vapor

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
which is why you have to wear a vapor

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.400 
which is why you have to wear a vapor
Cruise<00:04:10.680> because<00:04:11.280> if<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.549> have<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.700> loose<00:04:11.970> sock

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
Cruise because if you have a loose sock

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.590 
Cruise because if you have a loose sock
flop<00:04:13.669> let's<00:04:14.669> get<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:16.639> in

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
flop let's get it in

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.080 
flop let's get it in
Oh<00:04:21.590> God<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:23.580> we<00:04:23.670> go

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
Oh God there we go

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.500 
Oh God there we go
takes<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.530> much<00:04:25.680> longer<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.040> get<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:26.390> but<00:04:27.390> it's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
takes not much longer to get on but it's

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.080 
takes not much longer to get on but it's
a<00:04:27.570> super<00:04:27.960> nice<00:04:28.110> tight<00:04:28.380> cleat<00:04:28.650> there's<00:04:29.090> it's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
a super nice tight cleat there's it's

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.150 
a super nice tight cleat there's it's
really<00:04:30.390> secure<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.930> all<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:32.010> you're

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
really secure and all of it and you're

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.650 
really secure and all of it and you're
not<00:04:32.190> really<00:04:32.340> dependent<00:04:32.880> on<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.060> laces<00:04:33.450> to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
not really dependent on the laces to

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.270 
not really dependent on the laces to
keep<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.020> tight<00:04:34.170> you<00:04:34.350> could<00:04:34.500> go<00:04:34.590> no<00:04:34.770> laces<00:04:35.130> and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
keep it tight you could go no laces and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.270 
keep it tight you could go no laces and
this<00:04:35.460> cleat<00:04:35.670> would<00:04:35.820> be<00:04:36.050> perfectly<00:04:37.050> tight<00:04:37.290> and

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
this cleat would be perfectly tight and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.710 
this cleat would be perfectly tight and
yeah<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:40.700> another<00:04:41.700> benefit<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.330> is

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
yeah so just another benefit of this is

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.930 
yeah so just another benefit of this is
you<00:04:43.200> don't<00:04:43.230> have<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.530> replace<00:04:43.710> these<00:04:43.980> as<00:04:44.790> you

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
you don't have to replace these as you

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.610 
you don't have to replace these as you
can<00:04:44.970> see<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:46.110> spike<00:04:46.670> right<00:04:47.670> here<00:04:48.290> is<00:04:49.290> getting

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
can see this spike right here is getting

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.110 
can see this spike right here is getting
a<00:04:49.740> lot<00:04:49.830> more<00:04:49.890> worn<00:04:50.220> down<00:04:50.400> than<00:04:50.790> some<00:04:50.970> of<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
a lot more worn down than some of the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.390 
a lot more worn down than some of the
other<00:04:51.240> ones<00:04:51.420> so<00:04:51.900> that's<00:04:52.860> how<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.010> looks<00:04:53.160> for<00:04:53.310> me

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
other ones so that's how it looks for me

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.950 
other ones so that's how it looks for me
for<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> game<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.180> there's<00:04:54.330> usually<00:04:54.480> padding

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
for a game and there's usually padding

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.420 
for a game and there's usually padding
along<00:04:55.890> right<00:04:56.280> here<00:04:57.800> but<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.980> don't<00:04:59.040> have<00:04:59.250> that

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
along right here but I don't have that

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.770 
along right here but I don't have that
but<00:04:59.670> there's<00:04:59.850> enough<00:05:00.030> padding<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.420> here<00:05:00.630> where

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
but there's enough padding in here where

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.950 
but there's enough padding in here where
it's<00:05:00.930> still<00:05:01.170> super<00:05:01.470> comfortable
