00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 a nice good evening it is a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.609
 race against time for almost three 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.270
 Weeks will be an 87 year old man 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.220
 missing 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 He is alone on a trip 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 broken up and not anymore 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.630
 The police have returned 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 a puzzle 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 but family and friends do not give up 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 together with volunteer Samaritans 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 you have another search today 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 started 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 accompanied by his house alive 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
 walk 1 in hernals breaks wolfgang 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 bernauer on 7 august to a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 walk towards bisamberg and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 does not return 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.840
 all searches in the bisamberg area 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 run unsuccessfully on leopoldsberg 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 take rescue dogs to the track of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 wieners is found the pension is 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 but until today not like the family 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 For example, get a shoe sole 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.110
 and with diesel shoe sole we have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 tries a trace of the doctor parnassus 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 take 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.489
 in the end it is the search for the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 needle in haystack therefore berner can im 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.670
 the final result be anywhere as long as you 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 maybe got in a train 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 or bus got in you can do that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.610
 Hard to say he was sure 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.619
 we can say here we have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 make several sightings with the dogs 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.450
 scoured and have here on the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 leopoldsberg dogs have one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 smell 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.869
 However, that was already nine days after 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 that disappeared and that was what it was for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.159
 We are also unclear whether the smell is not from 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 days before that is because simply the doctor 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130
 Bernese often went for a walk here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 up to 16 days after disappearing 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.189
 A person can be a beagle over a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.409
 provided garment 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.840
 to record the track of the missing 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.030
 depending on the weather conditions then 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.960
 loses track 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 Nevertheless, it can also be done in the case of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.450
 wolfgang bauer still give hope 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.710
 basically, of course, is the chance 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.329
 very low but the hope dies 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.119
 last and we already had cases 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.829
 where the person weeks later abroad 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.290
 showed up in a hospital 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.659
 on the day of his disappearance wolfgang 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.579
 bernauer similar to this one 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 olive shirt as well as an olive 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.170
 tracking pants with suspenders and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.170
 worn black hiking boots
