00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.830 
and then you're going to make sure you
have<00:03:04.459> some<00:03:04.700> sharp<00:03:05.000> scissors<00:03:05.620> snip<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:07.840> pull

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
have some sharp scissors snip that pull

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.370 
have some sharp scissors snip that pull
out<00:03:08.989> some<00:03:09.260> extra<00:03:09.620> yarn<00:03:09.890> snip<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:14.380> then

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
out some extra yarn snip that then

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.910 
out some extra yarn snip that then
you're<00:03:15.560> going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.770> take<00:03:16.040> your<00:03:16.280> yarn<00:03:16.550> and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
you're going to take your yarn and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.960 
you're going to take your yarn and
you're<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.069> shove<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.430> through<00:03:19.580> your

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you're going to shove it through your

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.430 
you're going to shove it through your
fingers<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.569> know<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.959> probably<00:03:21.230> looks

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
fingers and I know this probably looks

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.040 
fingers and I know this probably looks
dangerous<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.489> carefully<00:03:23.019> push<00:03:24.019> the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
dangerous but just carefully push the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.690 
dangerous but just carefully push the
yarn<00:03:24.380> through<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.819> then<00:03:28.819> grab<00:03:29.630> it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
yarn through like so and then grab it

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.059 
yarn through like so and then grab it
pull<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.850> through<00:03:32.290> grab<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.470> other<00:03:33.590> end<00:03:33.709> pull

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
pull it through grab the other end pull

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.990 
pull it through grab the other end pull
it<00:03:34.160> through<00:03:34.310> your<00:03:34.370> two<00:03:34.549> fingers<00:03:36.819> wrap<00:03:37.819> it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it through your two fingers wrap it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.039

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
fingers like this once you slide it off

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.830 
fingers like this once you slide it off
you<00:03:57.110> are<00:03:57.349> seeing<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:58.280> bundle<00:03:59.030> pull<00:03:59.630> that

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
you are seeing a bundle pull that

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.550 
you are seeing a bundle pull that
section<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.830> middle<00:04:00.980> down<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> little<00:04:02.560> so

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
section in the middle down a little so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.090

it's<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.890> center<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.510> then<00:04:05.510> pull<00:04:05.870> tight

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.990 

once<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.459> tight<00:04:10.640> you're<00:04:10.790> going<00:04:10.850> to

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
once you have it tight you're going to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.449 
once you have it tight you're going to
flip<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.690> now<00:04:12.680> you're<00:04:12.890> going<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.100> tie<00:04:13.400> it

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
flip it and now you're going to tie it

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:22.730 
flip it and now you're going to tie it
twice<00:04:15.459> one<00:04:16.459> two

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.580 

some<00:04:23.370> people<00:04:23.699> save<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.330> tail<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:25.350> tie<00:04:25.530> to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
some people save the tail to tie to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.640 
some people save the tail to tie to
garlands<00:04:26.400> but<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.300> snip<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.810> off<00:04:27.930> because<00:04:28.440> it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
garlands but I snip it off because it

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.920 
garlands but I snip it off because it
actually<00:04:28.819> drives<00:04:29.819> me<00:04:30.000> crazy<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.419> gets<00:04:30.690> in<00:04:30.810> my

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
actually drives me crazy and gets in my

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.930 
actually drives me crazy and gets in my
way<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.889> can<00:04:32.069> do<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.370> without<00:04:32.490> any

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
way if you can do it without any

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.020 
way if you can do it without any
problems<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.080> can<00:04:34.259> leave<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> tail<00:04:35.030> now

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
problems then you can leave the tail now

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.909 
problems then you can leave the tail now
you<00:04:36.090> have<00:04:36.419> your<00:04:36.569> bundle<00:04:37.050> you're<00:04:37.710> going<00:04:37.860> to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
start by cutting your loops just

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.010 
start by cutting your loops just
continually<00:04:51.030> go<00:04:51.300> around<00:04:51.660> cutting<00:04:51.990> your<00:04:52.289> loops

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.510

but it's a fun messy so I don't mind so

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.379 
but it's a fun messy so I don't mind so
once<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:49.600> have<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.139> basically<00:05:50.650> cut<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:52.240> can

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
once you have it basically cut you can

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.640 
once you have it basically cut you can
kind<00:05:52.630> of<00:05:52.690> open<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.139> up<00:05:53.289> shake<00:05:53.979> it<00:05:58.050> shake<00:05:59.050> it<00:05:59.110> and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
then you'll see that there's still some

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.200 
then you'll see that there's still some
scrag<00:06:03.430> lers<00:06:03.699> am<00:06:04.509> I<00:06:04.570> saying<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:04.930> right

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
scrag lers am I saying that right

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.379 
scrag lers am I saying that right
stragglers<00:06:07.479> scrag<00:06:07.930> lers<00:06:08.460> and<00:06:09.460> then<00:06:10.090> you'll<00:06:10.240> go

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
stragglers scrag lers and then you'll go

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:11.939 
stragglers scrag lers and then you'll go
ahead<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:10.750> just<00:06:10.960> trim<00:06:11.199> it<00:06:11.349> up<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.530> little<00:06:11.680> bit

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
ahead and just trim it up a little bit

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:24.180 
ahead and just trim it up a little bit
more<00:06:19.710> once<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.919> get<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.610> formation<00:06:23.190> you're

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
more once you get the formation you're
