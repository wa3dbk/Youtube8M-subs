00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like every other glitch you can you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.319 
like every other glitch you can you
pretty<00:00:44.430> much<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.149> phone

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to see where this is first before we do

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
to see where this is first before we do
it<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> guys<00:00:49.770> actually<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.399> where<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> go

one deathmatch it's over near Vespucci
Beach<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.860> pretty<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.699> count

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Beach and it's pretty much if you count

down<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> left<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.660> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
down to the left and you will make it so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149
