00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 that those handle 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.720
 the sour cream is a matter besides that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.410
 the boat is fixed and it says white 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.010
 sour cream is much denser that appointment 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.560
 and delicious of I put vinegar chive if 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.580

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.130
 of the onion cambray 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.400
 so 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.010
 and chicken soup very important for 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.270
 that gives him flavor but he will not know 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.730

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.450
 very much with very little then we are going to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 start let's put the lettuce that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.719
 icebergs can be lettuce or it can be 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.459

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.250

 he wanted to give a little bit of use then 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.299
 let's put turkey breast the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.019
 slice you want you can do 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.760
 as fat as cheddar cheese if you do not 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.669
 has that society can put you 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.350

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.570
 I make this bacon is extremely healthy 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.050
 very little fat you can bake it in fact 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.660
 if you bake it you will save 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.460
 fat 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.440
 time to fry it because you always have to 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.170
 put oil because they have nothing of 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.200
 fat then a little bit of tomato to 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.330
 give freshness and then if we do 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.410
