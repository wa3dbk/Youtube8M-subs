I<00:05:43.659> gotta<00:05:43.839> tell<00:05:44.020> you<00:05:44.139> perk<00:05:44.349> or<00:05:44.499> did<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.770> good<00:05:44.919> job

I gotta tell you perk or did a good job
there<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.610> think<00:05:45.879> that<00:05:46.029> this<00:05:46.149> team<00:05:46.360> is

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
there and I think that this team is

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.269 
there and I think that this team is
young<00:05:46.779> we<00:05:47.199> will<00:05:47.319> see<00:05:47.469> a<00:05:47.499> lot<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.709> wins<00:05:48.009> and

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
young we will see a lot of wins and

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.859 
young we will see a lot of wins and
losses<00:05:48.399> they'll<00:05:49.059> beat<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.389> teams<00:05:49.629> like

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:49.869 
losses they'll beat the teams like

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.480 
losses they'll beat the teams like
Colgate<00:05:50.469> they'll<00:05:50.709> beat<00:05:50.889> the<00:05:51.039> teams<00:05:51.279> like

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
Colgate they'll beat the teams like

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.070 
Colgate they'll beat the teams like
Binghamton<00:05:52.029> and<00:05:52.089> that<00:05:52.240> stretch<00:05:52.569> but<00:05:52.930> then

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
Binghamton and that stretch but then

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.779 
Binghamton and that stretch but then
it'll<00:05:53.199> be<00:05:53.259> harder<00:05:53.680> when<00:05:53.830> they<00:05:53.919> vs<00:05:54.249> st.<00:05:54.490> John's

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
it'll be harder when they vs st. John's

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.519 
it'll be harder when they vs st. John's
the<00:05:54.999> Georgia<00:05:55.360> Tech's<00:05:55.599> the<00:05:55.809> Harvard's<00:05:56.319> and

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
the Georgia Tech's the Harvard's and

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.859 
the Georgia Tech's the Harvard's and
teams<00:05:57.039> of<00:05:57.219> that<00:05:57.339> caliber<00:05:57.879> and<00:05:58.089> I<00:05:58.419> really<00:05:58.659> think

00:05:58.859 --> 00:05:58.869 
teams of that caliber and I really think

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:00.029 
teams of that caliber and I really think
that<00:05:58.959> this<00:05:59.169> year<00:05:59.409> they<00:05:59.529> might<00:05:59.740> even<00:05:59.860> surprise

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
that this year they might even surprise

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.980 
that this year they might even surprise
you<00:06:00.459> like<00:06:00.490> they<00:06:00.789> did<00:06:00.969> last<00:06:00.999> year<00:06:01.360> when<00:06:01.899> they

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
you like they did last year when they

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.230 
you like they did last year when they
