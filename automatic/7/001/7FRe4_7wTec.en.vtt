preamp<00:01:55.409> made<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.799> Olympic<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> in

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
preamp made by Olympic which this is in

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.350 
preamp made by Olympic which this is in
here<00:01:57.240> where<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.409> top<00:01:58.950> preamp<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.729> for<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> high

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
here where the top preamp is for is high

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.649 
here where the top preamp is for is high
gain<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> low<00:02:01.710> PM<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> low<00:02:03.420> gain

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
gain and the low PM it's for is low gain

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
gain and the low PM it's for is low gain
and<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.560> split<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> base<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.000> use<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
and it split on the base and we use a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.320 
and it split on the base and we use a
five<00:02:07.020> pin<00:02:07.310> connector<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> typically

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
five pin connector which is typically

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
five pin connector which is typically
used<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.110> lighting<00:02:10.470> rig<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:10.950> for

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
used in a lighting rig or for

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.110 
used in a lighting rig or for
here<00:02:12.599> back<00:02:12.780> systems<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:14.459> run<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> base<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
here back systems to run the base and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.479 
here back systems to run the base and
that's<00:02:15.240> basically<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.569> explicit<00:02:16.170> signal<00:02:16.500> those

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
that's basically I explicit signal those

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.920 
that's basically I explicit signal those
go<00:02:17.640> through<00:02:17.849> separate<00:02:18.150> cabinets<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.780> their

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
go through separate cabinets to their

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.640 
go through separate cabinets to their
cabinets<00:02:19.530> low<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.010> high<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:21.450> used<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> use<00:02:22.020> 18

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
cabinets low and high it used to use 18

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.670 
cabinets low and high it used to use 18
cabinets<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> low<00:02:23.430> low<00:02:23.700> end<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.360> now<00:02:24.480> we

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
cabinets for the low low end but now we

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
cabinets for the low low end but now we
moved<00:02:25.680> over<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.069> ampeg<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.209> 15<00:02:27.599> handle<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
moved over to ampeg and the 15 handle to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.500 
moved over to ampeg and the 15 handle to
low<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.380> very<00:02:28.650> well<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.220> we're<00:02:29.970> happy<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.360> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
low in very well so we're happy with it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.680 
low in very well so we're happy with it
and<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.770> see<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> little<00:02:32.550> Fender<00:02:33.000> amp<00:02:33.030> over<00:02:33.480> there

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690

guitar amp with a base rig well with the
high<00:02:44.250> end<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.000> preamp<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:45.989> a

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
high end on this preamp it has a

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.320 
high end on this preamp it has a
high-pass<00:02:46.620> filter<00:02:47.100> which<00:02:47.280> allows<00:02:47.760> us<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.150> run

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
high-pass filter which allows us to run

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.630 
high-pass filter which allows us to run
the<00:02:48.510> high<00:02:48.660> frequencies<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.340> Fender<00:02:50.610> amp

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the high frequencies on the Fender amp

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.000 
the high frequencies on the Fender amp
we<00:02:50.970> give<00:02:51.180> them<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.540> nice<00:02:51.750> crunchy<00:02:52.319> rock

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010

sounds<00:02:53.610> okay<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.299> tell<00:02:54.450> us<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.720> bit

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
sounds okay can you tell us a little bit

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.210 
sounds okay can you tell us a little bit
about<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.230> amps<00:02:55.530> underneath<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> fender

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
about the amps underneath the fender

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.039 
about the amps underneath the fender
then<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.910> basically<00:02:57.209> what<00:02:57.420> we're<00:02:57.569> using<00:02:57.750> four

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
then so basically what we're using four

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.020 
then so basically what we're using four
amps<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.069> preamps<00:02:59.519> are<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.819> Olympic

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
amps out of the preamps are the Olympic

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.890 
amps out of the preamps are the Olympic
prints<00:03:00.569> we're<00:03:00.720> using<00:03:02.090> MPEG<00:03:03.090> amps<00:03:03.480> which<00:03:03.660> this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
prints we're using MPEG amps which this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.340 
prints we're using MPEG amps which this
is<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.110> SV<00:03:04.700> chief<00:03:05.700> or<00:03:06.120> pro<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:07.200> has<00:03:07.319> a

is the SV chief or pro and it has a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.250 
is the SV chief or pro and it has a
stereo<00:03:07.890> input<00:03:08.610> which<00:03:09.360> allows<00:03:09.660> us<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.989> run<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
stereo input which allows us to run the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.009 
stereo input which allows us to run the
low<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.530> high<00:03:10.590> gains<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
low and high gains on that and then the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.170 
low and high gains on that and then the

california-based company that deals only

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020 
california-based company that deals only
in<00:03:58.230> bass<00:03:58.470> care<00:03:58.829> coup<00:03:59.100> stick<00:03:59.160> bass<00:03:59.489> gear<00:03:59.819> and

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
in bass care coup stick bass gear and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.789 
in bass care coup stick bass gear and
they're<00:04:00.150> very<00:04:00.480> good<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.870> basically<00:04:01.590> what

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
they're very good and basically what

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.140 
they're very good and basically what
they<00:04:01.950> did<00:04:02.010> was<00:04:02.220> they<00:04:02.519> came<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> house<00:04:03.120> and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
they did was they came to the house and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.710 
they did was they came to the house and
they<00:04:03.510> measured<00:04:04.019> my<00:04:04.049> old<00:04:04.530> bass<00:04:05.100> exact<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.239> mean

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
they measured my old bass exact I mean

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.890 
they measured my old bass exact I mean
every<00:04:07.260> little<00:04:07.769> corner<00:04:08.250> everything<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.359> so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
every little corner everything and so

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.349 
every little corner everything and so
this<00:04:10.079> bass<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:10.769> an<00:04:10.889> exact<00:04:11.310> copy<00:04:11.579> made<00:04:12.209> in

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
this bass is like an exact copy made in

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.370 
this bass is like an exact copy made in
China<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:14.549> also<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.269> has<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> detachable

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
China and it also is it has a detachable

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.779 
China and it also is it has a detachable
neck<00:04:16.979> as<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.940> see<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:19.099> this<00:04:20.099> neck<00:04:20.459> comes

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
neck as you can see here this neck comes

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.200 
neck as you can see here this neck comes
off<00:04:21.030> and

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
off and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.710 
off and
goes<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:25.220> goes<00:04:25.400> into<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.699> box<00:04:26.000> that's<00:04:26.389> probably

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
goes it goes into a box that's probably

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.170 
goes it goes into a box that's probably
about<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:27.169> big<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.789> ship<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
about that big and so I can ship the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.659 
about that big and so I can ship the
bass<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.600> easily<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.259> under<00:04:30.800> 40<00:04:31.250> pounds

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
bass really easily it's under 40 pounds

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.790 
bass really easily it's under 40 pounds
to<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.880> bass<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.569> it's<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.229> good<00:04:33.380> sounding

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
to the bass and it's a good sounding

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.279 
to the bass and it's a good sounding
bass<00:04:33.949> for<00:04:34.250> live<00:04:34.430> performance<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:36.199> know

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
bass for live performance and you know

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.930 
bass for live performance and you know
it's<00:04:36.440> funny<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.830> know<00:04:36.919> when<00:04:37.069> I<00:04:37.099> when<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.520> play

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
it's funny you know when I when I play

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.960 
it's funny you know when I when I play
we<00:04:38.750> do<00:04:38.990> stages<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:39.889> or<00:04:40.400> if<00:04:40.520> I'm<00:04:40.639> playing

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
we do stages like this or if I'm playing

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.820 
we do stages like this or if I'm playing
with<00:04:41.060> returner<00:04:41.449> for<00:04:41.599> ever<00:04:41.840> bigger<00:04:42.199> stages

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
with returner for ever bigger stages

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.650 
with returner for ever bigger stages
we're<00:04:43.460> pretty<00:04:43.669> much<00:04:43.880> in<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.180> rock<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.449> roll

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
we're pretty much in a rock and roll

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.499 
we're pretty much in a rock and roll
environment<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.710> basses<00:04:46.430> can<00:04:46.639> get<00:04:46.849> messed<00:04:47.300> up

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
environment and basses can get messed up

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.999 
environment and basses can get messed up
real<00:04:47.780> easy<00:04:47.810> when<00:04:48.259> they're<00:04:48.440> sitting<00:04:48.800> backstage

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
real easy when they're sitting backstage

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.240 
real easy when they're sitting backstage
and<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.729> got<00:04:49.880> 30<00:04:50.660> crew<00:04:51.050> guys<00:04:51.259> moving<00:04:51.979> lights

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
and you got 30 crew guys moving lights

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.120 
and you got 30 crew guys moving lights
and<00:04:52.669> this<00:04:52.819> an<00:04:53.120> amplifier<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:54.889> know<00:04:54.979> these

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
and this an amplifier so you know these

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.969 
and this an amplifier so you know these
basses<00:04:55.639> are<00:04:55.840> inexpensive<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.110> they<00:04:57.560> sound

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
basses are inexpensive but they sound

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.210 
basses are inexpensive but they sound
really<00:04:58.250> good<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.180> so<00:05:00.080> that's<00:05:00.770> that's<00:05:00.979> what

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
really good and so that's that's what

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.240 
really good and so that's that's what
I'm<00:05:01.340> using<00:05:01.580> here<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:02.449> how<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.139> amplified<00:05:04.009> I

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
I'm using here and how is it amplified I

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.969 
I'm using here and how is it amplified I
have<00:05:05.090> an<00:05:05.330> Underwood<00:05:05.870> pickup<00:05:06.349> here<00:05:06.620> which<00:05:06.800> is

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
have an Underwood pickup here which is

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.409 
have an Underwood pickup here which is
this<00:05:07.160> pickup<00:05:07.639> here<00:05:07.820> that<00:05:07.940> goes<00:05:08.090> right<00:05:08.360> into

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
this pickup here that goes right into

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.499 
this pickup here that goes right into
the<00:05:08.780> slots<00:05:09.289> of<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.530> bridges<00:05:10.039> here<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:11.300> go

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
the slots of the bridges here and I go

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.529 
the slots of the bridges here and I go
into<00:05:11.660> an<00:05:11.870> ampeg<00:05:13.000> amplifier<00:05:14.000> over<00:05:14.210> here<00:05:14.360> which

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
into an ampeg amplifier over here which

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.529 
into an ampeg amplifier over here which
he<00:05:14.860> explained<00:05:15.860> earlier<00:05:16.159> and<00:05:16.490> that's<00:05:17.150> pretty

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
he explained earlier and that's pretty

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.920 
he explained earlier and that's pretty
much<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.949> know<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.370> then<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:19.940> use<00:05:20.240> this<00:05:20.720> is

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
much it you know and then I use this is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.589 
much it you know and then I use this is
kind<00:05:21.319> of<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.500> secret<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:22.069> having<00:05:22.819> a<00:05:22.909> good<00:05:23.090> bass

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
kind of a secret to having a good bass

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.469 
kind of a secret to having a good bass
sound<00:05:23.960> which<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:24.800> this<00:05:24.889> EBS<00:05:25.460> box<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.090> think<00:05:26.360> that

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
sound which is this EBS box I think that

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.850 
sound which is this EBS box I think that
every<00:05:26.690> bass<00:05:26.900> player<00:05:27.199> should<00:05:27.440> have<00:05:27.620> one<00:05:27.830> of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
every bass player should have one of

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.790 
every bass player should have one of
these<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:29.389> also<00:05:29.570> acoustic<00:05:30.169> guitar<00:05:30.500> players

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
these and also acoustic guitar players

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.180 
these and also acoustic guitar players
it's<00:05:31.070> just<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.520> very<00:05:31.880> warm<00:05:32.680> box<00:05:33.680> that<00:05:34.070> allows

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
it's just a very warm box that allows

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.629 
it's just a very warm box that allows
you<00:05:34.669> not<00:05:35.150> only<00:05:35.509> good<00:05:35.810> EQ<00:05:36.289> and<00:05:36.590> good<00:05:37.370> pre

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
you not only good EQ and good pre

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.270 
you not only good EQ and good pre
amplification<00:05:38.449> but<00:05:39.050> it<00:05:39.199> also<00:05:39.320> gives<00:05:40.099> you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
amplification but it also gives you

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.490 
amplification but it also gives you
there's<00:05:40.729> many<00:05:40.940> inputs<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:41.659> outputs<00:05:42.080> so<00:05:42.440> you

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
there's many inputs and outputs so you

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.950 
there's many inputs and outputs so you
have<00:05:42.740> flexibility<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:44.270> know<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.419> go<00:05:44.719> to<00:05:44.750> a

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960

has<00:05:47.479> a<00:05:47.509> an<00:05:48.199> echo<00:05:48.620> very<00:05:49.310> sophisticated<00:05:49.669> echoes

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
has a an echo very sophisticated echoes

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.629 
has a an echo very sophisticated echoes
then<00:05:50.449> you<00:05:50.599> can<00:05:50.750> could<00:05:50.960> connect<00:05:51.440> effects<00:05:52.250> up<00:05:52.490> to

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
then you can could connect effects up to

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.089 
then you can could connect effects up to
it<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:52.969> very<00:05:53.210> good<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.289> has<00:05:54.409> two<00:05:54.710> stages

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
it and very good and it has two stages

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.370 
it and very good and it has two stages
two<00:05:55.520> different<00:05:55.909> sets<00:05:56.479> of<00:05:56.599> EQ<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.110> have<00:05:57.199> an<00:05:57.289> A

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
two different sets of EQ you have an A

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.950 
two different sets of EQ you have an A
and<00:05:57.560> a<00:05:57.620> B<00:05:57.969> thing<00:05:58.969> there<00:05:59.180> so<00:05:59.360> you<00:05:59.719> can<00:05:59.870> have

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
and a B thing there so you can have

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.010 
and a B thing there so you can have
preset<00:06:00.500> you<00:06:01.250> know<00:06:01.370> EQ<00:06:01.849> with<00:06:02.150> just<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.570> flip<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:02.960> a

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
preset you know EQ with just a flip of a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.100 
preset you know EQ with just a flip of a
switch<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.560> and<00:06:03.740> B<00:06:03.919> mutes<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.759> bass<00:06:05.000> as<00:06:05.240> well<00:06:05.270> so

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
switch a and B mutes the bass as well so

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.560 
switch a and B mutes the bass as well so
it's<00:06:06.199> perfect<00:06:06.620> for<00:06:06.770> me<00:06:06.889> we<00:06:07.669> also<00:06:07.849> have<00:06:08.210> another
