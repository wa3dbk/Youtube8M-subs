panels<00:00:14.570> in<00:00:15.049> fact<00:00:15.320> ik<00:00:15.469> thought<00:00:15.650> it<00:00:15.830> was<00:00:15.950> a<00:00:15.980> mini

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
panels in fact ik thought it was a mini

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.670 
panels in fact ik thought it was a mini
street<00:00:16.730> fighter<00:00:17.030> and<00:00:17.420> then<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:17.990> complained

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
street fighter and then I complained

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.470 
street fighter and then I complained
because<00:00:18.859> I<00:00:19.099> wanted<00:00:19.430> something<00:00:19.670> a<00:00:20.029> bit<00:00:20.240> bigger

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
because I wanted something a bit bigger

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.109 
because I wanted something a bit bigger
so<00:00:20.779> they<00:00:21.740> give<00:00:21.890> me<00:00:22.039> something<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:22.580> bit<00:00:22.789> bigger

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
so they give me something a bit bigger

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.300 
so they give me something a bit bigger
they've<00:00:23.449> given<00:00:23.660> me<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.619> Yammer<00:00:24.830> air

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
they've given me this the Yammer air

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.269 
they've given me this the Yammer air
rocks<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.060> air<00:00:26.390> ups<00:00:26.570> 100<00:00:27.140> mind<00:00:27.349> it's<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.980> big<00:00:28.130> in

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
rocks and air ups 100 mind it's a big in

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.749 
rocks and air ups 100 mind it's a big in
a<00:00:28.750> powerful<00:00:29.750> one<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:30.560> has<00:00:30.769> in<00:00:30.919> fact<00:00:31.130> got<00:00:31.730> a

statement on the side same performance

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.160 
statement on the side same performance
so<00:00:34.190> we<00:00:34.340> thought<00:00:34.490> we'd<00:00:34.670> try<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.020> then<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
so we thought we'd try it then the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
so pleased that it's a 100 cc version

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.500 
so pleased that it's a 100 cc version
because<00:00:57.410> there<00:00:57.740> is<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:57.890> 50<00:00:58.310> cc<00:00:58.460> version<00:00:58.730> which

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
because there is a 50 cc version which

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.900 
because there is a 50 cc version which
is<00:00:59.720> indeed<00:01:00.020> restricted<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.100> 30<00:01:01.310> miles<00:01:01.640> an<00:01:01.820> hour

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
is indeed restricted to 30 miles an hour

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.469 
is indeed restricted to 30 miles an hour
and<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:02.780> one<00:01:02.990> being<00:01:03.200> twice<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.100> CC<00:01:04.580> does<00:01:05.360> it

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
and this one being twice the CC does it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.149 
and this one being twice the CC does it
have<00:01:05.630> twice<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:06.140> power<00:01:06.350> well<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.799> does<00:01:07.009> in

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
have twice the power well it does in

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.639 
have twice the power well it does in
actual<00:01:07.460> fact<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.450> little<00:01:08.869> fifty<00:01:09.229> CC

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
actual fact because a little fifty CC

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.380 
actual fact because a little fifty CC
has<00:01:09.770> got<00:01:10.009> 3.7<00:01:10.850> horsepower

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
has got 3.7 horsepower

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.779 
has got 3.7 horsepower
whereas<00:01:11.960> this<00:01:12.109> a<00:01:12.170> big<00:01:12.590> powerful<00:01:13.570> 101<00:01:14.570> CCS<00:01:15.500> a

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
whereas this a big powerful 101 CCS a

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.630 
whereas this a big powerful 101 CCS a
7.5<00:01:16.789> horsepower<00:01:17.289> so<00:01:18.289> twice<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.590> power<00:01:18.950> does

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
7.5 horsepower so twice the power does

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.609 
7.5 horsepower so twice the power does
that<00:01:19.789> mean<00:01:19.999> twice<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> speed<00:01:20.659> play<00:01:21.229> natural

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
that mean twice the speed play natural

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.099 
that mean twice the speed play natural
fat<00:01:21.829> it<00:01:22.130> does<00:01:22.520> because<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.630> course<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
fat it does because of course the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.489 
fat it does because of course the
legally<00:01:24.530> restricted<00:01:25.039> 50<00:01:25.640> cc<00:01:26.030> version<00:01:26.060> just<00:01:27.049> 30

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.630 
bit of wind behind you down a slope
willing<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.479> do<00:01:32.719> around<00:01:32.960> 60<00:01:33.590> miles<00:01:33.770> an<00:01:33.920> hour<00:01:34.009> so

twice the speed so it's quite an

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.130 
twice the speed so it's quite an

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
enjoyable machine and does it stop well

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.499 
enjoyable machine and does it stop well
well<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:39.590> stops<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.100> plenty<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:40.700> enough<00:01:40.939> if
