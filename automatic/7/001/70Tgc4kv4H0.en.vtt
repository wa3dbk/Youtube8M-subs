00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.870 

very<00:00:50.810> last<00:00:51.110> step<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.920> natural<00:00:52.190> hair<00:00:52.700> regimen

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
very last step in a natural hair regimen

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.420 
very last step in a natural hair regimen
and<00:00:53.360> technically<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.380> can<00:00:54.620> omit<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.040> as<00:00:55.400> a

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
and technically you can omit that as a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.370 
and technically you can omit that as a
step<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.060> I<00:00:56.090> think<00:00:56.450> it's<00:00:56.600> very<00:00:56.660> important

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
step but I think it's very important

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.120 
step but I think it's very important
it's<00:00:57.890> styling<00:00:58.760> your<00:00:59.060> hair<00:00:59.120> having<00:00:59.930> 4c<00:01:00.560> hair<00:01:00.740> I

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's styling your hair having 4c hair I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.880 
it's styling your hair having 4c hair I
think<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.820> know<00:01:01.940> I<00:01:02.510> shouldn't<00:01:03.110> say<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.290> think<00:01:03.410> I

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
think I know I shouldn't say I think I

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.370 
think I know I shouldn't say I think I
know<00:01:04.300> done<00:01:05.300> my<00:01:05.540> hair<00:01:05.750> doesn't<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.290> be
