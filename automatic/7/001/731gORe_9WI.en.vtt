00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.140
 on the last lap last round of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.849
 career in brno 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 marquez dani pedrosa very difficult if not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.990
 he makes a mistake that he only takes care 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.429
 rossi will be cleared autistic 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.429
 I think so 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:31.410
 neither because we are in the last 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.410
 return of the circuit please 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.360
 in your fight we will see how they are for 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.360
 in front of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.560
 if there is not an error has owner sounds 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.900
 Jorge Lorenzo is still here 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.690
 practically half a turn and for 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.360
 is to overstate that he made an error or 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.930
 not in the management of what little remains 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930
 of the circuit 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.789
 and it is also 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 to get to 0 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.790
 in the second partial 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.290
 now 04 shorten the difference a little 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.750
 Care that maybe you love the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 marked in the previous step by the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 Goal a difference 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:34.680
 but valentino that you can 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 let's see one of your good ones have the 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.840
 affirmation 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.790
 Well, what a beautiful career 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.790
 wonder tank 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.770
 on top of the World Cup motorbike 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.400
 to put himself in absolute position in the 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.140
 marc marquez team that has won the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.510
 career that follows more world leader 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:28.629
 forever 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:30.819
 the advantage over pink and look that has 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.470
 made a carrerÃ³n also always behind 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.630
 but it has tended to memory 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.590
 For example, it was precisely third 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.780
 but more powerful travel 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.440
 and now they are going to think is refound not 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.440
 we serve 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.330
 julia and emilio the week 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.099
 we want the apples to have something 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.099
 of advantage with you 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.500
 we choose
