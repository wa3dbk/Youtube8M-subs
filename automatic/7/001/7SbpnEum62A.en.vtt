 quiz today thought anyone down there 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.300
 come now I will explain why it is 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 that when you want to repair 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.489
 your fur coat or arch to clean it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.680
 or sew new fur product 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 Please pay attention first 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.800
 on the quality of the fur if your kind is new 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 secondly products of course this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 please first line on 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 professionalism of the people you are 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 are turning 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 because this bag belongs here 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.909
 enough young girls who 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.820
 advised the studio and said that there 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.380
 work wonders 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.299
 month I will show you so I'm through something here on 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.159
 the creature on my table is lying right now 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 short chinchilla fur jacket 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.880
 quite expensive delicate 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.909
 beautiful which are worn overall 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.259
 it is not very long and that needs 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:37.350
 maximum care is wrong 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:42.000
 for a long time in general, the girl repaired 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.439
 once again maybe 3 maybe 5 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.630
 your fur coat 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.210
 but she continues to tear and and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 break out in almost the same 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.090
 here's the place 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.060
 yes of course our with you under this very 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.320
 aggressive environment 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.880
 certainly armpit 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.390
 This is one of the places on the coat that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.679
 experiencing maximum loads but in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
 anyway then the question arises 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.780
 why do we repair only one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.110
 tire they 2 we checked 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 Is the product sitting on the client, that is ? 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.260
 Are there any problems with fur coats? 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.030
 because of the wrong cut no seemingly 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.720
 everything is fine then what is the question how 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.700
 see here here is a little noise 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.549
 committed and and in fact not visible to her 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.329
 you can just grope but by itself 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:50.700
 already need to install 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:53.690
 here it is a little higher cartoon octave tea 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.739
 this part but also in general 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:06.859
 touches the sleeve 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:09.209
 here it is a place in general what is the problem with 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:14.299
 first looks understand completely 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.299
 impossible therefore our specialists 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.639
 hid the lining and that's what they 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:33.799
 already repeatedly armhole as you see 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.900
 glued skin here it is on black and 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.659
 Feels like skin is very rough and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.930
 tough 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:46.079
 those who touched at least sometime 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.480
 chinchilla skins he knows he already lived 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:57.919
 very thin to living tissue and therefore here 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:02.760
 this is a skin on chinchilla that in itself is not 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:07.519
 good and attention how is she 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:14.129
 God here keeps 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:16.889
 learn this one-digit yellowness 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.940
 nets this dealt in the lid 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.599
 modeling any 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.770
 aircraft construction and anything else 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:31.380
 of course familiar with glue moment 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.740
 which loads the skin and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.630
 them and which of course glue 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:46.849
 such things can no longer your attention 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.849
 that taped time two three 4 5 six 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.970
 armhole six places here it is ours with you 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.710
 hole 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.259
 and all this happens because the skin is under 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.520
 glue exposure and without impact 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:07.310
 even if by need just been sewn 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:11.039
 she very much draws on living tissue and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:16.020
 Of course it does not stand up and bursts 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.400
 all in new and new places exactly 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.830
 so I want to ask 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 people in fur atelier if you 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.630
 professional and how do you allow such 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.630
 work with other people's money 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:37.509
 and it is completely understandable why 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:43.349
 from the outside the gust happens then 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.349
 here here and there here and there 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.409
 unfortunately this damage will be 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.270
 manifest again and again and we are nothing 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:57.430
 already here we can not do because 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.630
 tear off that skin already 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:06.669
 impossible glue glue moment all the same 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:10.870
 not bad keeps and touches it all and 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:18.099
 this one and this one and this one 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:23.069
 this one in sleeves and this one on the back and two 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:27.690
 these are the parts that fit the backrest 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:31.630
 that is, to actually remove it 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:35.310
 to restore this need to be solved 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:38.770
 half noise a reasonable question arises 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.969
 why people who can't work 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.509
 with chinchilla fur 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:49.300
 I take a question for it, I hope 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:52.630
 will find your minds 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:57.699
 Your answer is completely different for everyone. 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:03.430
 he will be but before his vision 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:05.919
