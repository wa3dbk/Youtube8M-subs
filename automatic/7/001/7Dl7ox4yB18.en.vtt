the comments and won't full walk back
there<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:10.409> though<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
there a little while though what that is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
there a little while though what that is
where<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> main<00:01:12.030> instructional<00:01:12.840> areas<00:01:13.200> are

where the main instructional areas are
and<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.430> you'll<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.580> quite<00:01:14.670> surprised

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and I think you'll be quite surprised

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.469 
and I think you'll be quite surprised
that<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:16.560> small<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.000> building<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that really how small the building is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
that really how small the building is
when<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.020> back<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.710> terms<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.100> how

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
when we get back there in terms of how

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
when we get back there in terms of how
far<00:01:20.820> kids<00:01:21.060> will<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> transport<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.590> walk

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to get them fast to class it's really

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
to get them fast to class it's really
it's<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.130> designed<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> main

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it's really designed so that the main

you'll notice the classroom here is
about<00:04:07.480> 890<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.620> where<00:04:08.770> they<00:04:09.490> all<00:04:09.640> are

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
about 890 so where they all are

as<00:04:28.450> I've<00:04:28.600> mentioned<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.110> we<00:04:29.230> have<00:04:29.380> wireless

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
as I've mentioned that we have wireless

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
throughout the building facility it also

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.310 
throughout the building facility it also
has<00:04:33.100> two<00:04:33.400> separate<00:04:34.240> work<00:04:34.450> areas<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:35.110> over
