00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
remember the Newcastle had a lot of

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.280 
remember the Newcastle had a lot of
injuries<00:01:18.180> since<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.630> start<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.050> season

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
injuries since the start of this season

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.500 
injuries since the start of this season
and<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.550> signings<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> Moussa<00:01:21.330> Sissoko

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
and with the signings of Moussa Sissoko

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.680 
and with the signings of Moussa Sissoko
and<00:01:22.230> yo<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.409> goof<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:22.800> last<00:01:23.250> week<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:24.480> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
and yo and goof around last week and the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.320 
and yo and goof around last week and the
return<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> several<00:01:25.470> key<00:01:25.680> players<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.330> think

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
return of several key players I think

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
return of several key players I think
that<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.720> could<00:01:27.780> turn<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> corner<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that they could turn a corner and I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.440 
that they could turn a corner and I
think<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.400> could<00:01:29.550> turn<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> corner<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.180> spurs

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
think they could turn a corner of spurs

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.680 
think they could turn a corner of spurs
who've<00:01:30.750> been<00:01:31.220> bailed<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:32.700> Gareth<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.330> the

who've been bailed out by Gareth in the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.670 
who've been bailed out by Gareth in the
last<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> last<00:01:34.800> month<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:36.080> think<00:01:37.080> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
last in the last month or so i think the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.080 
last in the last month or so i think the
5.5<00:01:38.400> available<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.420> victor<00:01:40.380> chandler<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
5.5 available by victor chandler is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.710 
5.5 available by victor chandler is
something<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.210> i'd<00:01:42.330> probably<00:01:42.510> have<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
something that i'd probably have a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.219 
something that i'd probably have a
nibbler<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:44.330> when<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.600> tempted<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.049> go

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
nibbler so when you get tempted to go

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
nibbler so when you get tempted to go
here<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.770> goals<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.370> spurs<00:01:47.729> have

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
here with the goals you know spurs have

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.460
