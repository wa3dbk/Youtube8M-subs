00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
hook this is a lot to a sickle book and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
hook this is a lot to a sickle book and
i'm<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.330> hook<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.780> right

i'm going to take the hook in right
through<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.830> pail<00:00:44.040> plastic<00:00:44.640> I've<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:44.910> an

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
through the pail plastic I've got an

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
through the pail plastic I've got an
o-ring<00:00:45.240> on<00:00:45.630> here<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.290> I'm<00:00:46.410> still<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
o-ring on here but I'm still going to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
o-ring on here but I'm still going to
bite<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.130> through<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> plastic<00:00:47.970> on<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
bite down through the plastic on the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
bite down through the plastic on the
light<00:00:48.840> side<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.220> like<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> call<00:00:50.580> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
light side or what I like to call the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.710 
light side or what I like to call the
belly<00:00:51.090> side<00:00:51.450> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.200> laminated<00:00:53.100> stickler<00:00:54.090> so

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
belly side of the laminated stickler so

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.810 
belly side of the laminated stickler so
I'm<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:55.320> take<00:00:55.740> it<00:00:55.890> through<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> plastic

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I'm going to take it through the plastic

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.600 
I'm going to take it through the plastic
and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.989> i'm<00:00:58.290> still<00:00:58.560> underneath<00:00:58.860> my

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
and then out i'm still underneath my

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.450 
and then out i'm still underneath my
oring<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> does<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.800> creates<00:01:02.190> weight

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
oring what this does is creates weight

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.479 
oring what this does is creates weight
on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> light<00:01:03.150> side<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.649> that<00:01:05.159> bait

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on the light side and so that that bait

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
on the light side and so that that bait
will<00:01:05.670> drop<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> light<00:01:07.350> side<00:01:07.649> down

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
will drop down with the light side down

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
will drop down with the light side down
because<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:08.909> hooks<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.659> side<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
because the hooks on the right side and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
because the hooks on the right side and
it's<00:01:10.560> heavier<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> more<00:01:12.000> natural

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it's heavier so you get a more natural

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's heavier so you get a more natural
presentation<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.800> real<00:01:13.950> trick<00:01:14.280> here

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
presentation but the real trick here

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
presentation but the real trick here
because<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.570> I've<00:01:15.720> rigged<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.440> can

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
because of the way I've rigged it I can

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
because of the way I've rigged it I can
actually<00:01:16.979> shake<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> bait<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
actually shake the bait and I do this a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
actually shake the bait and I do this a
lot<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> times<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.740> cold<00:01:19.950> front<00:01:20.190> conditions

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
lot of times in cold front conditions

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.430 
lot of times in cold front conditions
just<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.909> add<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.420> extra<00:01:21.570> click<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
just to add a little bit extra click to

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.320 
just to add a little bit extra click to
the<00:01:22.560> big<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.220> shake<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> bait<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the big and I shake the bait and when I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
the big and I shake the bait and when I
shake<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> bait<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.650> I've<00:01:25.770> rigged<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.190> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
shake the bait and I've rigged it this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
shake the bait and I've rigged it this
way<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> light<00:01:26.970> side<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.510> using<00:01:28.440> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
way with the light side down using the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310 
way with the light side down using the
hook<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> weight<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> down<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> lights<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
hook to weight it down the lights I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
hook to weight it down the lights I
flicks<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.370> so<00:01:32.970> basically<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.659> you've

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
flicks up and so basically if you've

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
flicks up and so basically if you've
ever<00:01:33.930> looked<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> water<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.310> seen

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
ever looked into the water and seen

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
ever looked into the water and seen
minnows<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.260> them<00:01:37.440> because<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
minnows you can see them because the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
minnows you can see them because the
belly<00:01:38.549> splash<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> same<00:01:40.080> thing

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
belly splash and that's the same thing

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.390 
belly splash and that's the same thing
I'm<00:01:40.380> doing<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.010> making<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
I'm doing with this I'm making that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
I'm doing with this I'm making that
belly<00:01:41.729> flash<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.510> lot<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> minnows<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
belly flash a lot of minnows have and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.890 
belly flash a lot of minnows have and
that's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.159> great<00:01:44.280> attractor<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> find

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
that's a great attractor that I find

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.680 
that's a great attractor that I find
really<00:01:45.990> works<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.770> big<00:01:47.070> fish<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.700> cold<00:01:48.420> front

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
really works on big fish in cold front
