another item i would recommend that you
do<00:03:13.900> get<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.170> bizzle<00:03:14.709> scepter<00:03:15.190> but<00:03:15.400> from<00:03:15.640> there

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
do get a bizzle scepter but from there

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.539 
do get a bizzle scepter but from there
it<00:03:16.239> gets<00:03:16.510> really<00:03:16.989> conditional<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.220> what<00:03:18.459> is

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
it gets really conditional like what is

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.949 
it gets really conditional like what is
your<00:03:18.670> team<00:03:18.880> need<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.359> do<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.480> need<00:03:19.569> do<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
your team need what do you need do you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.690 
your team need what do you need do you
need<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.350> more<00:03:20.500> tanky<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.340> need<00:03:21.519> more

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
need to be more tanky do you need more

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.490 
need to be more tanky do you need more
damage<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.540> from<00:03:22.750> there<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.049> have<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.260> really

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
damage so from there you have to really

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.650 
damage so from there you have to really
judge<00:03:23.829> your<00:03:24.040> situation<00:03:24.670> your<00:03:24.819> team<00:03:25.150> comp<00:03:25.450> and

from there I personally usually always
which<00:03:58.150> makes<00:03:58.599> no<00:03:58.690> sense<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:59.500> w<00:04:00.310> after<00:04:00.880> q<00:04:01.180> just

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
which makes no sense go w after q just

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.420 
which makes no sense go w after q just
because<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.169> makes<00:04:02.440> her<00:04:02.650> able<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.040> run<00:04:03.310> around

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
because it makes her able to run around

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.699 
because it makes her able to run around
the<00:04:03.639> map<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:04.060> lot<00:04:04.329> faster<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.019> i<00:04:05.079> can<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.470> from

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the map a lot faster so i can go from

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.099 
the map a lot faster so i can go from
lane<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.010> lane<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.459> buff<00:04:07.299> debuff<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
lane to lane and buff debuff and

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.960 
lane to lane and buff debuff and
wherever<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.590> need<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.980> be<00:04:09.099> much<00:04:09.489> much<00:04:09.730> much

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
wherever I need to be much much much

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.420 
wherever I need to be much much much
faster<00:04:10.269> if<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:11.169> max<00:04:11.440> my<00:04:11.650> W<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.400> are

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
faster if I max my W now there are

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.759 
faster if I max my W now there are
certain<00:04:12.880> situations<00:04:13.419> where<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.630> will<00:04:14.019> max<00:04:14.260> my<00:04:14.530> e

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
certain situations where I will max my e

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.949 
certain situations where I will max my e
after<00:04:15.310> Q<00:04:15.579> and<00:04:15.849> that's<00:04:16.000> usually<00:04:16.479> when<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.660> feel

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
after Q and that's usually when I feel

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.289 
after Q and that's usually when I feel
like<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.139> need<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.650> duel<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.310> little<00:04:18.970> bit<00:04:19.120> better

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
like I need to duel a little bit better

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.479 
like I need to duel a little bit better
so<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.870> example<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.530> someone<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:21.250> constantly

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
so for example if someone is constantly

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.150 
so for example if someone is constantly
trying<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> counter<00:04:22.510> jungle<00:04:22.840> me

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
trying to counter jungle me

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.550 
trying to counter jungle me
I<00:04:23.220> will<00:04:23.580> usually<00:04:23.790> take<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:24.510> e<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.470> I'm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I will usually take my e so that I'm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.350 
I will usually take my e so that I'm
able<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.010> do<00:04:26.400> with<00:04:26.610> them<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.910> kill<00:04:27.090> them<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
able to do with them and kill them and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.240 
able to do with them and kill them and
we'll<00:04:27.540> hopefully<00:04:27.810> pick<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> kill<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:28.920> them

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
we'll hopefully pick up the kill on them

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.360 
we'll hopefully pick up the kill on them
but<00:04:29.700> usually<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.180> will<00:04:30.630> max<00:04:30.960> my<00:04:31.200> W<00:04:31.590> first<00:04:31.920> just

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
but usually I will max my W first just

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.620 
but usually I will max my W first just
so<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.520> can<00:04:32.610> run<00:04:32.850> around<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.150> map<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.540> be<00:04:33.600> a

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
so I can run around the map and be a

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.660 
so I can run around the map and be a
little<00:04:33.930> bit<00:04:34.170> more<00:04:34.320> useful<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:35.100> my<00:04:35.310> entire

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
little bit more useful for my entire

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.180 
little bit more useful for my entire
team<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.390> not<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:37.110> one<00:04:37.380> lane<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.800> makes<00:04:38.010> her

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
team and not just one lane it makes her

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.240 
team and not just one lane it makes her
