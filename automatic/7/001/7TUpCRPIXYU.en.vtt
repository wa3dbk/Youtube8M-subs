I<00:00:52.579> think<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.239> no<00:00:54.480> fad<00:00:54.750> thing<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.289> great

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
I think that this no fad thing is great

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
I think that this no fad thing is great
and<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> things<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and one of the things I think is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.950 
and one of the things I think is
happening<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:59.309> basically<00:00:59.969> completely

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
happening is I've basically completely

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.270 
happening is I've basically completely
lost<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.350> interest<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> watching<00:01:02.640> television

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
lost all interest in watching television

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
lost all interest in watching television
so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.909> never<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.780> cared<00:01:07.140> about<00:01:07.229> television

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so I never really cared about television

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
so I never really cared about television
before<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.670> sometimes<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.600> sit<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
before but sometimes I would just sit in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.670 
before but sometimes I would just sit in
front<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> TV

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
front of the TV

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
front of the TV

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
if I were bored or stoned and I would

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.440 
if I were bored or stoned and I would
just<00:01:13.770> put<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.400> something<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.270> me

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
just put on something that would make me

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.039
