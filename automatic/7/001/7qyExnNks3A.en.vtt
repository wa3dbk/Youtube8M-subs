00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
channel anymore so anyway down to the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.940 
channel anymore so anyway down to the
battle<00:01:11.580> fake-out<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.840> fairly<00:01:13.170> obvious<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
battle fake-out was fairly obvious and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
battle fake-out was fairly obvious and
trick<00:01:14.670> room<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> fairly<00:01:15.420> obvious<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.890> i

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
trick room is fairly obvious up so i

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
trick room is fairly obvious up so i
went<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:18.030> though<00:01:18.090> i've<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.360> actually

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
went with even though i've got actually

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
went with even though i've got actually
a<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.810> cool<00:01:18.930> strategy<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.790> lead

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a really cool strategy with this lead

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.320 
a really cool strategy with this lead
that<00:01:21.570> involves<00:01:22.020> skill<00:01:22.320> swapping<00:01:22.770> levitate

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
that involves skill swapping levitate

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.380 
that involves skill swapping levitate
onto<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:25.170> lantern<00:01:25.790> that's<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.150> i<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.360> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.199 
protect his trap Inge goes for the
earthquake<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.900> am<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.190> fact<00:03:20.489> slow<00:03:20.940> enough

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
earthquake I am not in fact slow enough

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.729 
earthquake I am not in fact slow enough
so<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.750> slow<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.350> trap<00:03:22.739> inch<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:25.440> runs<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
so out slow that trap inch so it runs a

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.670 
so out slow that trap inch so it runs a
cust<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.130> fairy<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:27.000> custom<00:03:27.930> fairies<00:03:28.230> kind<00:03:28.560> of

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
cust a fairy and custom fairies kind of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.160 
cust a fairy and custom fairies kind of
glitchy<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.100> PBR<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.540> basically<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
glitchy and PBR so basically that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
glitchy and PBR so basically that
allowed<00:03:31.560> me<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> was<00:03:32.459> completely<00:03:32.790> wasted

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
allowed me that it was completely wasted

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.729 
allowed me that it was completely wasted
that<00:03:33.360> term<00:03:33.540> because<00:03:33.630> i<00:03:33.780> obviously<00:03:33.959> i<00:03:34.290> already

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
that term because i obviously i already

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.710 
that term because i obviously i already
knew<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:34.950> i<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.340> slower<00:03:35.610> than<00:03:35.850> his<00:03:36.120> ghastly

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
knew that i was slower than his ghastly

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.570 
knew that i was slower than his ghastly
i<00:03:37.019> go<00:03:37.410> ahead<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.830> over<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> power<00:03:38.220> band

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
i go ahead and go over the power band

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.100 
i go ahead and go over the power band
that<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> take<00:03:39.330> out<00:03:39.510> his<00:03:39.660> trapping

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
that is going to take out his trapping

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.840 
that is going to take out his trapping
but<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.709> would<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:40.980> been<00:03:41.040> really<00:03:41.370> nice<00:03:41.519> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
but what would have been really nice is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.210 
but what would have been really nice is
for<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.630> activate<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.290> next<00:03:43.709> turn<00:03:43.920> where<00:03:44.190> i

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
for it to activate the next turn where i

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.650 
for it to activate the next turn where i
could<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.549> actually<00:03:44.730> could<00:03:45.269> actually<00:03:45.420> got

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
could have actually could actually got

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.350 
could have actually could actually got
some<00:03:45.840> good<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.350> could<00:03:46.799> have<00:03:46.980> out<00:03:47.790> slowed

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
some good I could have out slowed

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.090 
some good I could have out slowed
whoever<00:03:49.110> else<00:03:49.290> was<00:03:49.410> on<00:03:49.530> his<00:03:49.709> team<00:03:49.860> although

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
whoever else was on his team although

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.170 
whoever else was on his team although
actually<00:03:50.220> guess<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.610> doesn't<00:03:50.760> really<00:03:51.000> make

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
actually guess that doesn't really make

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.690 
actually guess that doesn't really make
sense<00:03:51.239> because<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.860> he<00:03:53.040> ko'd<00:03:53.430> me<00:03:53.549> this

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
sense because you know he ko'd me this

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.120 
sense because you know he ko'd me this
