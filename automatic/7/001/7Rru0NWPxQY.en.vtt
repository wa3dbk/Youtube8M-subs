00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
the last time it was like started up was

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.110 
the last time it was like started up was
eight<00:01:21.470> years<00:01:21.500> ago<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.280> that<00:01:22.400> was<00:01:22.550> by<00:01:22.700> me<00:01:22.910> and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
eight years ago and that was by me and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.470 
eight years ago and that was by me and
then<00:01:23.750> before<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.260> was<00:01:24.650> probably<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.480> you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
then before that was probably like you

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
know five years before that so this this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.260 
know five years before that so this this
bike<00:01:28.460> gets<00:01:28.700> ridden<00:01:29.120> about<00:01:30.110> once<00:01:30.440> every<00:01:31.270> you

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.790 
know decade or whatever and and you know
and<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.330> still<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.750> runs<00:01:38.960> fine<00:01:39.230> each<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.620> every

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
and it still it runs fine each and every

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.650 
and it still it runs fine each and every
time<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:40.610> there's<00:01:41.210> nothing<00:01:41.300> wrong<00:01:41.600> with

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
time and it's there's nothing wrong with

time and it's there's nothing wrong with
it<00:01:42.340> shocks<00:01:43.340> are<00:01:43.550> really<00:01:43.820> springy<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:45.560> guess

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
it shocks are really springy and I guess

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.790 
it shocks are really springy and I guess

do<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.380> on<00:01:54.620> this<00:01:54.710> thing<00:01:54.770> because<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.280> brakes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
do that on this thing because the brakes

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.890 
do that on this thing because the brakes
are<00:01:55.580> kind<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.760> spongy<00:01:56.060> at<00:01:56.150> first<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.630> think

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.290 
are kind of spongy at first but I think
they've<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.590> don't<00:01:58.550> know<00:01:58.610> dried<00:01:59.060> out<00:01:59.270> or

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
they've I don't know dried out or

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.670 
they've I don't know dried out or
whatever<00:01:59.750> they're<00:01:59.960> good<00:02:00.200> they're<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.560> they

whatever they're good they're that they

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
whatever they're good they're that they
should<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:00.950> working<00:02:01.100> better<00:02:01.310> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
should be working better now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.310 
should be working better now
now<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.510> that<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.780> brakes<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.110> lock
