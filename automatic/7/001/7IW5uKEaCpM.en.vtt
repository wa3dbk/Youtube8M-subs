00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.740
In 2010, a young Afghan businessman returned
to Afghanistan from the UK with a mission

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920
to create Afghanistan's first ever rugby federation.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.070
“I saw the popularity, energy and the physical
activity in this Rugby game I really liked

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.199
it and the way they tassel and the way the
physics is involved in this game, I thought

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.730
that this energetic and full of physical game
would be a perfect match for Afghanistan’s

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.730
people”.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.579
After the creation of the federation, they
faced the challenge of scouting players in

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.650
a country where rugby had never been played.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.800
However, Afghan athletes warmly welcomed the
new sport.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.969
“We arranged this Rugby camp on the day
first there was like 5 people than 10 people

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:58.920
and than 40 people and then we started up
this one month camp here in Kabul and we selected

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.340
our national team.”

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.000
The majority of players from Afghanistan's
national rugby team say that even before the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.100
federation was created, they were already
interested in rugby and watched games on TV.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.350
“I was really interested in Rugby and I
was watching Rugby matches on TV all the time.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.730
But unfortunately we didn’t have an opportunity
to play Rugby in Afghanistan.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.450
But fortunately now we have some possibilities
and it has been two years now that we are

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.450
playing Rugby.”

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.451
Now Afghanistan's rugby federation is firmly
established, there are more than 25 rugby

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:38.620
clubs and 250 rugby players in Kabul.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.330
Afghanistan's national rugby team has competed
in national and international friendlies where

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.730
they've had a good winning streak.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.270
“Our first competition was with our neighbors,
Pakistan, in Lahore, There were 16 teams and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.770
we came third.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.740
During that competition I was selected as
man of the match.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:24.580
After that we also had a friendly match in
Dubai with Shaheen Rugby team.”

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.420
Although rugby is now a new official sport
in Afghanistan, the majority of the national

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.060
team still say they face lots of challenges
like suitable grounds, equipment and especially

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.860
a coach to train them.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.110
But in the face of all these problems the
athletes are very optimistic about the future

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.090
of rugby in Afghanistan.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.980
“Our athletes are trying really hard during
training, they are strong physically and in

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.890
tactics, but the only problem that we still
have is that we don’t have a proper coach

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.890
or trainer.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.680
If we have a coach I am very sure the day
is not far away when we'll participate in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.720
the Rugby World cup.”
