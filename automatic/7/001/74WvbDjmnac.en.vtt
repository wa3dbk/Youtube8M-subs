00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
awesome I might actually try and make a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.550 
awesome I might actually try and make a
few<00:02:19.350> more<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.270> sure<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> almost<00:02:22.140> feel

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
few more I'm not sure but I almost feel

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.890 
few more I'm not sure but I almost feel
like<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.069> like<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.490> balsa<00:02:26.420> better<00:02:27.420> than<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like I like the balsa better than the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.680 
like I like the balsa better than the
kangaroo<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:31.069> don't<00:02:32.069> know<00:02:32.130> why<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:33.360> feels<00:02:33.630> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
kangaroo I don't know why it feels a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.840 
kangaroo I don't know why it feels a
little<00:02:33.810> easier<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.890> balsa<00:02:38.280> seems<00:02:38.520> like<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
little easier if the balsa seems like it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.070 
little easier if the balsa seems like it
feels<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:39.300> easier<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.020> feel<00:02:40.260> your<00:02:40.709> bevel

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.750 

but<00:02:44.080> anyway<00:02:44.410> um<00:02:44.590> yeah<00:02:46.200> they'll<00:02:47.200> do<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:50.760> freaky

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
but anyway um yeah they'll do a freaky

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.070 
but anyway um yeah they'll do a freaky
sharp-edged<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:54.280> does<00:02:54.670> seem<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
sharp-edged it does seem to like the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.220 
sharp-edged it does seem to like the
Diamonds<00:02:56.620> seem<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.480> more<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.660> draw<00:02:58.930> cut

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
Diamonds seem to like more of a draw cut

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.430 
Diamonds seem to like more of a draw cut
versus<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> straight-up<00:03:00.160> push<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.260> can

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
versus a straight-up push then I can

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.750 
versus a straight-up push then I can
force<00:03:05.709> cut<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:07.320> does<00:03:08.320> blank<00:03:08.680> pieces<00:03:09.040> though

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
force cut to does blank pieces though

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.900 
force cut to does blank pieces though
but<00:03:10.330> anyway<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:15.660> yeah<00:03:16.800> it's<00:03:17.910> ridiculously

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
but anyway so yeah it's ridiculously

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.680 
but anyway so yeah it's ridiculously
sharp

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
sharp

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.390 
sharp
let's<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:20.709> much<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.280> but<00:03:21.750> yeah<00:03:23.400> nothing

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
let's pretty much it but yeah nothing

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.370 
let's pretty much it but yeah nothing
much<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
much to it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.930 
much to it
just<00:03:26.380> some<00:03:26.530> balsa<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.400> said<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
just some balsa and like I said on the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.040 
just some balsa and like I said on the
particle<00:03:28.330> board<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:30.600> sprayed<00:03:31.600> down<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
particle board and sprayed down with the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.199 
particle board and sprayed down with the
diamond<00:03:32.350> spray<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:33.340> looks<00:03:33.519> pretty<00:03:33.790> hillbilly

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
diamond spray it looks pretty hillbilly

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.690 
diamond spray it looks pretty hillbilly
but<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.989> okay<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.709> works<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.560> yeah<00:03:39.160> if<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.580> end

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
but it's okay it works so yeah if I end

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.490 
but it's okay it works so yeah if I end
up<00:03:39.760> getting<00:03:39.970> some<00:03:40.239> pastes<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.900> stuff<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
up getting some pastes and stuff and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.960 
up getting some pastes and stuff and
trying<00:03:41.860> some<00:03:42.070> other<00:03:42.130> ones<00:03:42.400> I'll<00:03:42.580> let<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.850> know

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.640 
trying some other ones I'll let you know
and<00:03:43.720> then<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.230> wanted<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.890> just<00:03:45.190> say<00:03:46.500> when<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> was

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.740 
the paramilitary two and I also kept
saying<00:03:56.829> but<00:03:57.400> well<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:57.880> said<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.540> edge<00:03:58.720> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
saying but well I said that the edge is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.039 
saying but well I said that the edge is
point<00:03:59.320> zero<00:03:59.709> zero<00:03:59.769> one<00:04:00.239> behind<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.390 

there's<00:04:05.049> no<00:04:05.200> way<00:04:05.350> it's<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.650> thin<00:04:06.070> it's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
there's no way it's that thin it's

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.340 
there's no way it's that thin it's
actually<00:04:07.030> point<00:04:07.269> zero<00:04:07.630> one<00:04:07.870> five<00:04:08.350> oh<00:04:09.030> I

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
actually point zero one five oh I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
actually point zero one five oh I
contact<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.470> time<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.709> was<00:04:11.980> just<00:04:12.160> curious

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
contact the time I was just curious

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.310 
contact the time I was just curious
roughly<00:04:13.000> what<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.269> was<00:04:13.390> behind<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.840> edge<00:04:13.959> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
roughly what it was behind the edge and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.600 
roughly what it was behind the edge and
he<00:04:14.440> said<00:04:14.680> he<00:04:14.769> didn't<00:04:14.980> actually<00:04:15.100> measure<00:04:15.489> it

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610

he said he didn't actually measure it
but<00:04:15.970> he<00:04:16.870> said<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.620> was<00:04:17.769> probably<00:04:18.220> roughly

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
but he said it was probably roughly

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.090 
but he said it was probably roughly
around<00:04:18.930> 15,000<00:04:19.930> s<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:22.410> C<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.560> next<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.070> mean
