00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
ideally suited for thin skin where you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
ideally suited for thin skin where you

don't want it to be too strong for a
thick<00:01:46.110> skin<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> crease<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.240> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
thick skin you want the crease to be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.109 
thick skin you want the crease to be
more<00:01:48.659> prominent<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:50.280> definite<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
more prominent and more definite so that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.050 
more prominent and more definite so that
one<00:01:51.390> does<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.630> lose<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> fold<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.700> essence

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
one does not lose the fold so in essence

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
one does not lose the fold so in essence
we<00:01:54.360> could<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.750> control<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> depth<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.829> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
therefore looking from a side profile it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.150 
therefore looking from a side profile it
gives<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.210> nice<00:02:51.250> vertical<00:02:52.600> crisp<00:02:53.830> tissue<00:02:54.830> of

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
gives a nice vertical crisp tissue of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.320 
gives a nice vertical crisp tissue of
our<00:02:55.340> region<00:02:55.730> where<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:57.430> one<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.640> apply<00:02:58.940> makeup

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
our region where a one can apply makeup

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.980 
our region where a one can apply makeup
and<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.950> by<00:03:01.070> either<00:03:01.220> looking<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.090> looks<00:03:02.120> as

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and just by either looking it looks as

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.070 
and just by either looking it looks as
natural<00:03:03.290> as<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.010> could<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.330> also<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.750> 3d

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
natural as it could be also the 3d

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.180 
natural as it could be also the 3d
suture<00:03:06.440> technique<00:03:06.790> has<00:03:08.080> function<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.290> power

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
suture technique has function and power

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.820 
suture technique has function and power
in<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.240> can<00:03:11.420> control<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:13.180> eyelid<00:03:14.180> tilt

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
in that we can control for eyelid tilt

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.220 
in that we can control for eyelid tilt
so<00:03:15.830> what<00:03:15.950> do<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.100> mean<00:03:16.280> by<00:03:16.340> an<00:03:16.580> eyelid<00:03:17.030> tilt<00:03:17.330> well

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
so what do I mean by an eyelid tilt well

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.840 
so what do I mean by an eyelid tilt well
an<00:03:18.680> eyelid<00:03:19.160> can<00:03:19.459> be<00:03:19.670> low<00:03:20.270> in<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.620> has

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
an eyelid can be low in that it has

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.120 
an eyelid can be low in that it has
ptosis<00:03:22.850> or<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.930> could<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.230> partial<00:03:24.770> towards

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
ptosis or you could have partial towards

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.120 
ptosis or you could have partial towards
ptosis<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.480> certain<00:03:27.470> regions

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
ptosis in that certain regions

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.250 
ptosis in that certain regions
it<00:03:28.459> could<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.730> tilted<00:03:29.150> medially<00:03:29.630> or<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.110> could

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it could be tilted medially or it could

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.540 
it could be tilted medially or it could
be<00:03:30.350> tilted<00:03:30.800> not<00:03:31.160> only<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.890> 3d<00:03:34.130> suture

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
be tilted not only the 3d suture

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.600 
be tilted not only the 3d suture
technique<00:03:35.560> by<00:03:36.560> applying<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.280> suture

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
technique by applying the suture

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.610 
technique by applying the suture
technique<00:03:38.320> itself<00:03:39.320> can<00:03:40.100> compensate<00:03:40.910> for

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
technique itself can compensate for

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.729 
technique itself can compensate for
eyelid<00:03:42.620> ptosis<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.190> correct<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.120> this

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
eyelid ptosis and correct for this

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.479 
eyelid ptosis and correct for this
therefore<00:03:46.989> not<00:03:47.989> only<00:03:48.019> does<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.410> create<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.040> fall

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
therefore not only does it create a fall

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.949 
therefore not only does it create a fall
and<00:03:49.820> create<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> depth<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.040> fall<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.810> in

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
and create a depth of the fall and so in

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.949 
and create a depth of the fall and so in
the<00:03:54.080> tissue<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:55.160> lot<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.000> projection<00:03:56.570> it

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
the tissue of a lot of projection it

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.050 
the tissue of a lot of projection it
also<00:03:57.320> elevates<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.519> eyelid<00:03:58.910> itself<00:03:59.360> and<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
also elevates the eyelid itself and the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.040 
also elevates the eyelid itself and the
way<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.830> technique<00:04:03.830> works<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.550> that

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
way this technique works is that

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.080 
way this technique works is that
utilizes<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.670> EPM<00:04:07.670> q<00:04:08.180> technology<00:04:09.080> in<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:10.090> we

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
utilizes the EPM q technology in that we

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.270 
utilizes the EPM q technology in that we
calculate<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.260> vector<00:04:12.650> which<00:04:13.580> is<00:04:13.610> force

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
calculate the vector which is force

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.009 
calculate the vector which is force
in<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.790> directional<00:04:16.780> measure<00:04:18.660> vector<00:04:19.660> per

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
in a directional measure vector per

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.880 
in a directional measure vector per
millimeter<00:04:20.560> cube<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:23.380> suture<00:04:23.620> technique

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
millimeter cube so this suture technique

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.300 
millimeter cube so this suture technique
is<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:26.730> designed<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:29.200> celebrated<00:04:29.950> or

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
is is designed and it is celebrated or

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.860 
is is designed and it is celebrated or
individual<00:04:31.210> opera<00:04:31.630> eyelid<00:04:33.480> skin<00:04:34.480> and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
individual opera eyelid skin and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.720 
individual opera eyelid skin and
soft-tissue<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:37.210> what<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.870> does<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:39.070> we

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
soft-tissue so what it does is that we

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.430 
soft-tissue so what it does is that we
can<00:04:40.090> not<00:04:40.990> only<00:04:41.400> make<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.580> fold<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:44.230> could

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
can not only make the fold but we could

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.940 
can not only make the fold but we could
create<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.040> fold<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:46.240> would<00:04:46.600> be<00:04:46.690> ideal<00:04:46.950> that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
create the fold that would be ideal that

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.270 
create the fold that would be ideal that
will<00:04:48.100> give<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:49.090> natural<00:04:49.840> fold<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:51.220> you

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
will give you a natural fold that you

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.820 
will give you a natural fold that you
would<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:51.970> had<00:04:52.210> if<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.170> were<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.470> be<00:04:53.590> born

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
would have had if you were to be born

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.700 
would have had if you were to be born
with<00:04:54.010> their<00:04:54.160> fault<00:04:54.430> so<00:04:55.380> therefore<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.650> is

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
with their fault so therefore this is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.300 
with their fault so therefore this is
the<00:04:57.310> most<00:04:57.610> sophisticated<00:04:59.160> suture<00:05:00.160> technique

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the most sophisticated suture technique

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.340 
the most sophisticated suture technique
in<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:01.420> we<00:05:02.260> can<00:05:03.120> essentially<00:05:04.120> make<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
in that we can essentially make the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.460 
in that we can essentially make the
phone<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.760> were<00:05:06.850> meant<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.060> have<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
phone that you were meant to have so the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.250 
phone that you were meant to have so the
3d<00:05:08.740> suture<00:05:09.250> technique<00:05:09.430> is<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.390> most<00:05:10.600> advanced

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
3d suture technique is the most advanced
