guess it tourists thanks afar all right
let's<00:04:10.209> get<00:04:10.299> some<00:04:10.480> nature<00:04:10.690> guesses<00:04:11.079> I<00:04:11.170> was

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
let's get some nature guesses I was

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.020 
let's get some nature guesses I was
synchronizing<00:04:12.010> for<00:04:12.130> an<00:04:12.220> atom<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:12.610> nature<00:04:12.850> knows

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
synchronizing for an atom a nature knows

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.729 
synchronizing for an atom a nature knows
leaf<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.750> we'll<00:04:13.870> see<00:04:14.019> if<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.260> ends<00:04:14.380> up<00:04:14.530> coming

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
leaf so we'll see if that ends up coming

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.170 
leaf so we'll see if that ends up coming
out<00:04:15.040> on<00:04:15.220> top<00:04:15.430> right<00:04:15.640> now<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:15.760> end<00:04:15.910> up<00:04:15.970> getting

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
out on top right now we end up getting

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.469 
out on top right now we end up getting
the<00:04:16.239> atom<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.840> nature<00:04:17.049> or<00:04:17.109> not<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.239> we'll<00:04:19.239> see

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
the atom in nature or not and we'll see

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.670 
the atom in nature or not and we'll see
we'll<00:04:19.690> see<00:04:19.810> what<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:19.959> got<00:04:20.109> here<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.560> guys

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
we'll see what we got here and you guys

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.580 
we'll see what we got here and you guys
can<00:04:20.739> also<00:04:21.960> also<00:04:22.960> let<00:04:23.110> me<00:04:23.140> know<00:04:23.200> what<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.410> think

can also also let me know what you think
about<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.830> IV's<00:04:24.250> I'm<00:04:24.490> thinking<00:04:24.790> thinking<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
about the IV's I'm thinking thinking the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.080 
about the IV's I'm thinking thinking the
nature<00:04:25.960> is<00:04:26.110> not<00:04:26.380> gonna<00:04:26.560> synchronize<00:04:27.090> but

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
nature is not gonna synchronize but

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.430 
nature is not gonna synchronize but
we'll<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.330> what<00:04:28.419> its<00:04:28.540> IVs<00:04:28.810> are<00:04:29.020> first<00:04:29.320> and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
we'll see what its IVs are first and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.200 
we'll see what its IVs are first and
then<00:04:29.560> we'll<00:04:29.680> check<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.220> nature

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
then we'll check the the nature

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.550 
then we'll check the the nature
it<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.600> going<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.990> be<00:04:35.020> relatively<00:04:36.020> superior<00:04:36.530> a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
it is going to be relatively superior a

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.190 
it is going to be relatively superior a
special<00:04:36.950> attack<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.490> that's<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:38.300> not<00:04:38.930> very

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
special attack is that's it so not very

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.170 
special attack is that's it so not very
good<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:42.040> fine<00:04:43.040> citation<00:04:43.670> from<00:04:43.730> think

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
good and it's a fine citation from think

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.810 
good and it's a fine citation from think
of<00:04:44.390> my<00:04:45.110> name<00:04:45.590> say<00:04:45.950> miss<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> last<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.610> shine
