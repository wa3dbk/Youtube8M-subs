this<00:00:11.010> video<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.429> pretty<00:00:11.670> much<00:00:11.730> just<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
this video I'm pretty much just going to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.620 
this video I'm pretty much just going to
go<00:00:12.330> over<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.630> differences<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.740> screens

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
go over the differences with the screens

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.019 
go over the differences with the screens
because<00:00:15.980> everybody<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.220> reads<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.760> about

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
because everybody that reads all about

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.740 
because everybody that reads all about
you<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.449> PPI<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:20.100> resolution<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:21.480> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you know PPI and resolution and all that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.920 
you know PPI and resolution and all that
um<00:00:22.550> it<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.850> kind<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.180> misleading<00:00:24.660> because

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
um it can be kind of misleading because

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900 
um it can be kind of misleading because
there<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.380> some<00:00:25.650> different<00:00:26.039> technologies<00:00:26.730> at

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
there are some different technologies at

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
differences with that in a second the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
differences with that in a second the
motorola<00:01:07.290> droid<00:01:07.320> razr<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
motorola droid razr you're going to be

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.109 
motorola droid razr you're going to be
looking<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:10.189> 960<00:01:11.189> x<00:01:11.490> 540<00:01:12.619> pixel<00:01:13.619> layout<00:01:14.119> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
looking at 960 x 540 pixel layout and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
looking at 960 x 540 pixel layout and
the<00:01:15.420> screen<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the screen is going to be also just a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
the screen is going to be also just a
little<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.460> skinnier<00:01:17.880> too<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.110> do

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
little bit skinnier too because they do

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.560 
little bit skinnier too because they do
a<00:01:19.610> actual<00:01:20.610> 16<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.240> 9<00:01:21.479> screen<00:01:22.320> ratio<00:01:22.530> here

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
a actual 16 by 9 screen ratio here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
a actual 16 by 9 screen ratio here
whereas<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> Samsung<00:01:25.200> does<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.680> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
whereas the Samsung does not so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.050 
whereas the Samsung does not so
basically<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:26.909> bit

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
basically it's going to be a little bit

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.179 
basically it's going to be a little bit
wider<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.049> quite<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.470> tall<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.009> the

wider and not quite as tall on the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
wider and not quite as tall on the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
plus displays are going to have three

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.120 
plus displays are going to have three
sub-pixels<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.869> make<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.229> each<00:01:46.409> pixel<00:01:47.009> on

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
advanced but it's not really advanced

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.770 
advanced but it's not really advanced
now<00:04:18.030> let's<00:04:18.780> see<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:20.299> mentioned<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.359> Nexus

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
now let's see here I mentioned the Nexus

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.709 
now let's see here I mentioned the Nexus
earlier<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:23.159> Nexus<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.909> actually<00:04:24.330> going<00:04:24.599> to

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
earlier the Nexus is actually going to

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.900 
earlier the Nexus is actually going to
have<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.140> same<00:04:25.500> type<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.979> screen

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
have the same type of screen

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.790 
have the same type of screen
here<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.420> going<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.690> be<00:04:27.810> using<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.290> pencil

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
here it's going to be using that pencil

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.950 
here it's going to be using that pencil
display<00:04:30.680> however<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.100> pixel<00:04:33.090> per<00:04:33.270> inch<00:04:33.300> value

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
display however the pixel per inch value

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
display however the pixel per inch value
let's<00:04:34.590> get<00:04:34.800> into<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.100> for<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.370> second<00:04:35.820> with

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
let's get into that for a second with

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.020 
let's get into that for a second with
the<00:04:36.930> samsung<00:04:37.920> charger<00:04:38.490> you're<00:04:38.700> going<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.880> have

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the samsung charger you're going to have

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.570 
the samsung charger you're going to have
about<00:04:39.450> two<00:04:39.960> hundred<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.410> sixteen<00:04:40.920> pixels<00:04:41.400> per

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
about two hundred and sixteen pixels per

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.940 
about two hundred and sixteen pixels per
inch<00:04:41.610> that's<00:04:42.090> how<00:04:42.600> many<00:04:42.750> pixels<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.230> got<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:43.830> a

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
inch that's how many pixels you got in a

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.110 
inch that's how many pixels you got in a
square<00:04:44.280> inch<00:04:44.630> on<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.380> razor<00:04:46.740> here<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.430> believe

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
square inch on the razor here I believe

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.340 
square inch on the razor here I believe
it's<00:04:48.390> about<00:04:48.920> 240<00:04:49.920> 250<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.600> higher<00:04:51.930> pixel

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
it's about 240 250 so a higher pixel

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.490 
it's about 240 250 so a higher pixel
counts<00:04:53.600> keep<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.690> mind<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:55.050> not<00:04:55.260> counting

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
counts keep in mind that's not counting

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.870 
counts keep in mind that's not counting
the<00:04:55.770> sub-pixels<00:04:56.520> everything<00:04:57.410> so<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.890> Nexus

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the sub-pixels everything so the Nexus

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.070 
the sub-pixels everything so the Nexus
is<00:05:00.000> going<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.360> slightly<00:05:00.780> larger

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
is going to have a slightly larger

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.550 
is going to have a slightly larger
screen<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.270> actually<00:05:03.270> let<00:05:03.450> me<00:05:03.570> on<00:05:03.990> one<00:05:04.230> second

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
screen and actually let me on one second

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.810 
screen and actually let me on one second
let<00:05:04.650> me<00:05:04.680> turn<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.950> light<00:05:05.130> on<00:05:05.160> here<00:05:05.520> because<00:05:05.790> I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
let me turn the light on here because I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.310 
let me turn the light on here because I
actually<00:05:06.000> made<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> cutout<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:08.960> actually<00:05:09.960> made<00:05:10.290> a

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
actually made a cutout I actually made a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.840 
actually made a cutout I actually made a
cutout<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:12.320> to-scale<00:05:13.320> Nexus<00:05:13.980> screen<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.790> I

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
cutout of a to-scale Nexus screen and I

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.100 
cutout of a to-scale Nexus screen and I
was<00:05:14.940> going<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.150> show<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.330> guys<00:05:15.540> just<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.930> see

was going to show you guys just to see
how<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.290> compares<00:05:16.560> here<00:05:17.190> in<00:05:17.610> case<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.180> guys

are<00:05:18.360> wondering<00:05:19.010> how<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.450> 4.6<00:05:21.450> 5-inch<00:05:21.960> screen

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
are wondering how that 4.6 5-inch screen

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.160 
are wondering how that 4.6 5-inch screen
is<00:05:22.590> actually<00:05:22.920> going<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.130> stack<00:05:23.490> up<00:05:24.170> compared

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
is actually going to stack up compared

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.170 
is actually going to stack up compared
to<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.380> Motorola<00:05:26.750> 4.3<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.830> that's<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.400> to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
to that Motorola 4.3 so that's the to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.450 
to that Motorola 4.3 so that's the to
scale<00:05:30.630> next<00:05:31.050> screen<00:05:31.800> here<00:05:33.290> now<00:05:34.430> one<00:05:35.430> thing

more narrow body um compared to this

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.280 
more narrow body um compared to this
razor<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.570> going<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.750> have<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.930> larger

less of a of a bezel it's going to be
more<00:06:03.840> edge<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.260> edge<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:05.720> slightly<00:06:06.720> larger

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
more edge to edge so slightly larger

more edge to edge so slightly larger
screen<00:06:07.650> on<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.490> Nexus<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.240> this<00:06:09.419> is<00:06:09.570> kind<00:06:09.750> of

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
screen on the Nexus and this is kind of

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.320 
screen on the Nexus and this is kind of
just<00:06:09.900> to<00:06:10.200> give<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.530> a<00:06:10.590> rough<00:06:10.919> idea<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:11.580> you

just to give you a rough idea of you

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.250 
just to give you a rough idea of you
know<00:06:12.450> how<00:06:12.630> it<00:06:12.810> would<00:06:12.900> compare<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:15.030> 4.3<00:06:15.960> out

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
know how it would compare to the 4.3 out

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.090 
know how it would compare to the 4.3 out
there<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.710> these<00:06:20.630> Galaxy<00:06:21.630> Nexus<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:22.350> pixel

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
there so these Galaxy Nexus the pixel

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.340 
there so these Galaxy Nexus the pixel
per<00:06:23.280> inch<00:06:23.310> on<00:06:23.790> there<00:06:24.150> is<00:06:24.450> going<00:06:24.630> to<00:06:24.720> be<00:06:24.780> right

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
per inch on there is going to be right

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.350 
per inch on there is going to be right
around<00:06:26.810> 316<00:06:27.980> now<00:06:28.980> keep<00:06:29.400> in<00:06:29.520> mind<00:06:29.580> like<00:06:29.970> I<00:06:30.120> said

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
around 316 now keep in mind like I said

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.020 
around 316 now keep in mind like I said
it's<00:06:30.480> going<00:06:30.600> to<00:06:30.660> be<00:06:30.810> using<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.290> same<00:06:32.030> pentile

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
it's going to be using the same pentile

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.560 
it's going to be using the same pentile
display<00:06:33.630> so<00:06:34.640> even<00:06:35.640> though<00:06:35.669> yeah<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.150> has<00:06:36.539> a

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
display so even though yeah it has a

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.570 
display so even though yeah it has a
pretty<00:06:36.930> high<00:06:37.020> pixel<00:06:37.740> per<00:06:37.919> inch<00:06:37.950> count<00:06:38.340> we're

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
pretty high pixel per inch count we're

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.550 
pretty high pixel per inch count we're
still<00:06:38.880> looking<00:06:38.940> at<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.539> pentile<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.169> split

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
still looking at that pentile the split

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.970 
still looking at that pentile the split
now<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.610> haven't<00:06:42.180> seen<00:06:42.750> one<00:06:42.960> personally<00:06:43.560> up

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
now I haven't seen one personally up

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.909 
now I haven't seen one personally up
close<00:06:44.220> yet<00:06:44.810> but<00:06:45.810> I'm<00:06:45.900> hoping<00:06:46.380> that<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:46.710> won't

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
close yet but I'm hoping that it won't

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.080 
close yet but I'm hoping that it won't
be<00:06:47.160> quite<00:06:47.610> this<00:06:47.910> bad<00:06:49.280> I'm<00:06:50.280> sure<00:06:50.610> it's<00:06:50.850> going<00:06:51.000> to

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
be quite this bad I'm sure it's going to

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.610 
be quite this bad I'm sure it's going to
be<00:06:51.210> slightly<00:06:51.510> better<00:06:51.870> because<00:06:52.320> of<00:06:52.350> the<00:06:52.470> high

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
be slightly better because of the high

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.760 
be slightly better because of the high
higher<00:06:53.130> pixel<00:06:53.490> per<00:06:54.090> inch<00:06:54.120> column<00:06:54.960> but<00:06:55.530> I'm

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
higher pixel per inch column but I'm

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.760 
higher pixel per inch column but I'm
really<00:06:56.510> thinking<00:06:57.510> that<00:06:57.870> it<00:06:57.990> won't<00:06:58.230> even<00:06:58.530> look

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
really thinking that it won't even look

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.270 
really thinking that it won't even look
as<00:06:59.010> sharp<00:06:59.280> as<00:06:59.610> this<00:07:00.480> super<00:07:01.260> amoled<00:07:01.620> plus<00:07:01.650> on

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
as sharp as this super amoled plus on

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.560 
as sharp as this super amoled plus on
the<00:07:02.580> Samsung<00:07:03.090> Droid<00:07:03.240> Charge<00:07:05.030> so<00:07:06.030> yeah<00:07:06.419> I<00:07:06.450> mean
