00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Complement approaches as well 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.770
 he did it in the first vision and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.569
 retrieve it to look at sea ​​to serve 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.569
 side that happened there 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.950
 yes 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.910
 without need without necessity I the truth 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.619
 and 23 knights 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.970
 I did not like the ball to accelerate the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.970
 game and there was put together everything that gives 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.560
 and a fan gets in there then there's a 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.320
 swells almost a fan there 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.480
 after a fan and in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.340
 but it ends bumpy seen 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.989
 it's a shame it 's a pity that I 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 I ask like this because he gave him the head 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.670
 ro 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 does not ignore the situation and is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 for the media sector that today is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.350
 furious 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.760
 hernandez control 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.650
 all because this ended the game maybe 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 Cali had one minute left 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.500
 suddenly on the last move it could be 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.500
 I'm finishing the game very well 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 the normal play the struggle later what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.800
 ibargüen with saints I erased the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.080
 technicians when the ball are gone already 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.550
 that we are already seeing it is not good what 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.880
 that the technician, let alone the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.880
 player 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.350
 they also say everything but they go to 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 think about 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.500
 the technician is very wrong to maintain the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.890
 player because it first causes the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.890
 technical 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:58.329
 s head and if the technician does not have 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.610
 what to put the foot because total now 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.770
 here it is clearer than the player 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.659
 the technician touches the ball rolled each 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.659
 player and was the reaction of 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.970
 heads ejected
