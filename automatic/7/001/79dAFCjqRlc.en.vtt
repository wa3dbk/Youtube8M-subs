00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.259
 to those who were very wild 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.660
 way to erase tattoos with lime and 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.190
 carving I'm bleeding this artist 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.580
 the tattoo 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.950
 is the scar that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.430
 is this a state 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.680
 Well, the meat is out, but if 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 there is a separate scar because it is the 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 it came out in a session but for people 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.260
 that do not cheer up 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.720
 let's make a new draft is with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.900
 the magnifying glass a magnifying glass I do not know how 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.940
 know her as a magnifying glass as a lens but 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.850
 We will not use it directly because it will be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 a very strong burn I made some 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.860
 circles to cover the light field but 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.160
 this one was very strong do not support it this 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.000
 it was good 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 this 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.010
 here he is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 the sun will come in and the joke is 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.470
 like when we take killing is that we see 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.610
 things bring him the tattoo 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.610
 there you see the little hole 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.300
 and there the ink is charred 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.430
 It is less painful and leaves less scar 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.430
 because the skin is transparent 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.859
 the skin is transparent then in the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.920
 theory what you found the laser is 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.539
 that burn the ink inside and the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.369
 body the abav sipping for that is in 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.850
 several sessions then this is a 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.830
 way to make a burn 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 the sessions that are occupied by the sun 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.750
 a magnifying glass comes out daily if you can not 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.759
 buying about 50 pesos can be 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.659
 get then what are we going to do 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.590
 let's start to give 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.549
 soft light burn grade 2 the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.979
 of the sun 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.859
 does not last normal solar grade 1 we go to 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.719
 do a grade 2 there's so has to 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.549
 the ink burns inside so that it 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.499
 let the 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.470
 pigments and little by little with the tattoo 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:12.620
 know erasing and that is one more burned 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.049
 noble and there is no good scar left 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.879
 then he informs us if I find 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.879
 another thing another way to erase tattoos 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.500
 we want to start 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500
 you have to love this 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.390
 it does not have to be burned 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.400
 so strong 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.810
 enough 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 so you can make the pigments and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.959
 in many sessions people were made 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 cheaper than there is a group of 50 pesos 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.200
 Sun 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.540
 with that
