00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 no genetic engineering through the back door 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.870
 would you like to eat out 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 genetically modified plants eat food 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
 no, then you feel like 70 percent of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.389
 German lean on this presentation 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.670
 also the appetite goes by for the big ones 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 Agriculture is a problem because 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.560
 that's you genetically modified seed 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 in Germany practically unsalable 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.099
 but now they have a trick 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 found how to give her her food 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.519
 could still cheer 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.059
 They have developed new methods 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.960
 to manipulate the genes of plants 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:41.309
 For example, the oligonucleotides at the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.770
 oligonucleotide technology will become one 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 artificially created dna pieces in one 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.539
 cell and settles there 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 to the dna 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.410
 this will cause a change in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 The good plant triggers the plant to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.250
 Example with certain aka poisons 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.850
 can be sprayed without it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 to die 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.579
 ah yes quite complicated the whole 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.680
 but one thing is clear where specifically in the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 genotype is intervened 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.549
 genetic engineering instead 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.560
 but the genetic engineering law is at the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.930
 new manipulation methods so far 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 not applied 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 the responsible authority under 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 agriminister schmidt has the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.909
 even american company even 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 Confirmed that you are going to your new ups 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.680
 may grow in Germany already in 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 autumn 2015 these ups might like 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.960
 grown normal in Germany 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.500
 become 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.210
 the consequences would be incalculable 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 such plants from the laboratory into the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.530
 they can dismiss their environment 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.540
 spread uncontrollably and their 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.670
 manipulated genes to other plants 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.619
 pass on 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.909
 Once set in motion this is 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.570
 development is irreversible and rape is only 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.880
 the beginning 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.880
 other plants could follow if we did 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.330
 Do not do anything about it now 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.580
 s 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.560
 Join in our action and write 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.690
 now to agriculture minister christian schmidt 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 so that in the future all methods of 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.180
 GMOs are also considered as such 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.180
 and and the new rapeseed from the 8th
