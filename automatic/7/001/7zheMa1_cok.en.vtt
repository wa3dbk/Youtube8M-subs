00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.960
 grip weapon can continue 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.059
 pressure on the brush 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.840
 thus ensuring 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.050
 reception and this method is based on 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.530
 pressure applied to the lower end 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.369
 weapons which turn on 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.369
 hand of the enemy 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.720
 we strike and disarm the enemy 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.280
 in such cases disarmament often 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.280
 combined with counter-blow 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.470
 blow to the back of the hand 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.469

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.549
 in hand no less dangerous than moss and 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.170
 in it first of all dangerous blows 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:35.140
 butt arms and second grabs 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.300
 special technique is used against it 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 one way to disarm 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.180
 The enemy armed chain of shelving 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.180
 weapon is the effect on the connection 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.100
 the forearms are specially prepared for 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.470
 this purpose if they are also protected 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 any armor then success 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.750
 demonstrated equipment guaranteed
