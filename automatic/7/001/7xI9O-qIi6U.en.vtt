00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.299
 helps that being people be eliminated in 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.339
 this time we are in a game 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.470
 personalized of the two others this 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.570
 collection and good here I love you 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.519
 show this map that says comfort in the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.710
 option is a clear force dad 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.089
 says custom earthquake comfort 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.439
 some people do not get it for me 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.599
 being able to play is a practice as they can 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.990
 see we start this map pretty 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.640
 curious 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.410
 radio america how can you see is 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.060
 simple each player appears a respawn 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.920
 in the said bridge as you can review 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.419
 in the distant ports we jump in 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.970
 these platforms to get to the area 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.290
 Central is the battle zone and it 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.330
 there the battle begins not obviously 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.670
 there are weapons placed on the stage and 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.760
 rocket launcher there's a sword of the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.949
 toys and they kill a shotgun and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.449
 snipers purpose the above 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.910
 it was a rather curious experiment since 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.440
 that with there are few players that have 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 snipers take advantage of the one that goes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.190
 jumping as well as I saw here and you 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.900
 shoot the air and are curious 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.540
 now I finally managed to get more 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.210
 people and you'll see that it got good and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.310
 we lack the most because we were 67 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 the logistical map for 81 and over there 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.390
 have a kicker 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.580
 he tried to give it to there is not yet no I 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.150
 I think I was trying to carry the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.490
 bets and they kill me kill and I go out 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.560
 flying william is a pretty vote 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.159
 good father, no, I do not say it because 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.130
 you're going to cry but because I did not like it 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.369
 the way he had already 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.450
 and now yes that testing the vein of 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 same I had a lot of fun and the result 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.229
 It was pretty good and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.450
 and what to say 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.940
 on this map but in the end it was 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.980
 pretty good the only thing that is that 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.250
 it seems that the respaired almost always 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.200
 appears in a place when there are not six and 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 you see that another comes from the other side but 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.900
 suddenly like they appear almost in the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.270
 same place I do not know if by right of 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.430
 remove the exposure to die more and then 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 what will happen scraping takes time 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.630
 and then you take it like you can 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 appear on the cell phone I do not know I do not know how 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 explain it but well I started it put 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 good and what to prove system pilla 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.800
 I'm not playing the seed right now 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.840
 I live well there in the gameplay I am 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.430
 commenting right now because in 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.950
 that moment I could not record like this with 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 comments I could only record it 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.530
 but but well here that is here 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.959
 is 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.110
 and if I do not know if any of you are like that 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.850
 in case of Carmen I hope you like it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.319
 I do not know yet how can my maps for 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.520
 download but like the one in gmail 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.110
 it ends because he also wanted 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.750
 finish them the astro rayitas as they can 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.610
 see there is a tower that is this one because it is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 connected to the floor the others are not 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 floating then I wanted to fix that 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.950
 data type 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.900
 but well I do not know if I have time I'm going 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.520
 to do and maybe I can already put them to 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.850
 to download 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.850
 Y 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.250
 and I fall not 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.470
 because on that map I win to see region 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.379
 to see more well in this game I want to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.970
 to say is what I tell them it appeared just 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.050
 behind that ninth same line 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.050
 we throw grenades 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.360
 and I die 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.800
 and I reappear on the same line 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.090
 of the other only when they move to 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.380
 same time I think he answers and 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.820
 it is taken as you still can not 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.560
 appear in a place then if the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.710
 put aside where it does stipulate 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.420
 that each one appear in their same place 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.490
 you hide in teams that is to say each team 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.220
 is now mentioned the teams of one 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.250
 nothing more and each team is a color and in 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.390
 this occasion stipulates that the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.770
 responsible for each for each 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.900
 team ie the blue is for the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.910
 balls and nothing else can appear in the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.260
 golden for gold and there nothing more and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.150
 this is it is but against all 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.150
 then everyone has their normal skin 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.010
 taking 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.710
 cheesy rule for her there is a scene with 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.710
 the sniper birds and lagoons 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:33.749
 everything kills me 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.749
 Michael 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.270
 Today there is a link there and seems to be 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.360
 fell 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.360
 14 16 earning another guy 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.030
 do not 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.610
 miramar and again is to proclaim and many 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:02.610
 times 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.719
 Well, I do not know that those who ask for 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.069
 map I hope will get you out of it 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.500
 pretty good I tell you anybody can 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.699
 be the map in fort I am the address 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.169
 run from my first map made in 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.539
 force on this game because they will see that 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.219
 if not used by are other games and good 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.569
 he told me why not make a map and what 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.389
 upload the channel to see if people 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.870
 like they have a franc door in the 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.460
 air 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.340
 just before reaching the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.009
 platform and nice but he gave me because 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.580
 I liked 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:37.040
 and if the matter with grenades 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.360
 grenade flashlights 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.360
 what he called the adult 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.340
 at 25 when we won 25% 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:14.430
 what happens but it is not the same is not 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.460
 the same playing with the you try to go back 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.630
 to narrate something that you already played as 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.950
 I have to train a little more 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.260
 censor 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.360
 but good coming back from the other topic 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.159
 seriously good hope not like 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.539
 just because I wanted to go up to the channel 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:35.210
 and then to see what if they want to play it 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.039
 and then download the file so that 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.110
 download or we can meet again 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.430
 people who would also be father go back to 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.870
 gather eight other players now yes 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.539
 complete here we show by the 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.490
 6 the unit 28 and see how it gets 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.530
 do not 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.650
 Yes , of course if you like and if people 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.650
 come 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.580
 and the truth is that for the first 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.500
 test had waist 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.020
 if you like them happy I miss the 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.860
 principle the happy truth is a little 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.360
 strange because they saw here since he saw in 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.979
 the platforms have already adapted 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.979
 but he was quite a father 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.180
 I've always liked that detail that 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.020
 brings disaster and with all 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.020
 rolling compasses 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.930
 and good it appears the map turned out well 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.400
 I had to do a little bit by doing it 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.919
 because you have to prove it from the remains 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.330
 that did not appear below because below 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.400
 Well, since it's a lethal 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.129
 at the beginning if I put it against all 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.699
 appear below 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:41.529
 analyst memory I am approving already 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.419
 I see that the video was good that 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.739
 principle if it appears in each one or 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:48.069
 if they were many complete players if 

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:50.259
 appears each one in its in its respective 

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:52.479
 answer on each bridge because they are eight 

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:54.550
 bridges eight floating platforms 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:57.039
 and the players appear there 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.169
 then at the beginning if it happens right now 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:01.330
 like it appears wherever they go 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:04.479
 to show so good on youtube 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.179
 win the game as you can see 25-23 

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:08.949
 by little I earn good Gilt 

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:10.959
 that has like the fifth grade and good 

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:12.770
 people I hope you liked this 

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:14.539
 just like a small 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.490
 proof of my new map that I made for 

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:17.960
 force for the channel I hope that that 

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.520
 dislike and good we see you in a 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.520
 next video until next time
