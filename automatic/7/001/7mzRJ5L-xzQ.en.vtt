life just by doing this little trick
putting<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.080> nickel<00:02:33.650> metal<00:02:33.739> hydride

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
putting the nickel metal hydride

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.710 
putting the nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:02:34.640> into<00:02:34.910> your<00:02:36.400> into<00:02:37.400> your<00:02:37.430> radio<00:02:38.120> now

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
batteries into your into your radio now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.440 
batteries into your into your radio now
you're<00:02:39.140> gonna<00:02:39.290> need<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.950> battery<00:02:40.760> charger<00:02:41.269> for

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
you're gonna need a battery charger for

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.539 
you're gonna need a battery charger for
this<00:02:41.870> because<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.970> don't<00:02:44.660> believe<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
this because the I don't believe the

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.390 
this because the I don't believe the
radio<00:02:46.549> itself<00:02:46.879> can<00:02:47.150> charge<00:02:47.390> these<00:02:48.400> batteries

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
radio itself can charge these batteries

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.380 
radio itself can charge these batteries
up<00:02:50.329> but<00:02:50.959> hey<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:52.160> know<00:02:52.280> you're<00:02:52.760> gonna<00:02:52.879> save

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
up but hey you know you're gonna save

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.059 
up but hey you know you're gonna save
you<00:02:53.510> money<00:02:53.690> because<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:54.200> these<00:02:54.410> are<00:02:54.590> about

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
you money because for these are about

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.349 
you money because for these are about
six<00:02:55.370> dollars<00:02:55.579> okay

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
six dollars okay

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.140 
six dollars okay
so<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.079> thing<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.319> look<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.829> is<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.370> milliamp

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
so the thing to look for is the milliamp

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.880 
so the thing to look for is the milliamp
hours<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.900> battery<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:01.489> there<00:03:01.549> mAh<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
hours on the battery right there mAh and

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.979 
hours on the battery right there mAh and
make<00:03:04.730> sure<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.329> like<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.629> high

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
make sure that you have like a high

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.740 
make sure that you have like a high
number<00:03:06.049> on<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.239> point<00:03:08.450> two<00:03:08.599> hundred

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
number on that this is point two hundred

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.440 
number on that this is point two hundred
milli<00:03:09.530> amp<00:03:09.769> hours<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.849> think<00:03:11.209> that's<00:03:11.359> about

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
milli amp hours and I think that's about

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.390 
milli amp hours and I think that's about
the<00:03:11.629> highest<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.109> get<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.859> I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
the highest you can get on that and I

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.050 
the highest you can get on that and I
and<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:14.180> mhm<00:03:14.660> rechargeable<00:03:15.470> battery<00:03:15.819> note<00:03:16.819> that

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and I mhm rechargeable battery note that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
and I mhm rechargeable battery note that
you<00:03:17.180> will<00:03:17.390> need<00:03:17.629> a<00:03:17.690> recharger<00:03:18.260> for<00:03:18.440> these

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
you will need a recharger for these

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.660 
you will need a recharger for these
batteries<00:03:19.040> okay

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
batteries okay

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.629 
batteries okay
but<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:21.590> say<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:21.829> much<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.340> these<00:03:22.459> batteries

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
but you say so much on these batteries

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.599 
but you say so much on these batteries
that<00:03:23.030> you'll<00:03:23.359> you<00:03:23.780> know<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.859> you<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:25.370> so

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
that you'll you know and and you get so

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.670 
that you'll you know and and you get so
much<00:03:25.760> more<00:03:26.090> from<00:03:26.419> them<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.290> think<00:03:27.560> it's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
much more from them that I think it's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.849 
much more from them that I think it's
well<00:03:27.859> worth<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.099> extra<00:03:28.340> expense<00:03:29.380> okay<00:03:30.380> and

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
well worth the extra expense okay and

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.569 
well worth the extra expense okay and
basically<00:03:31.639> all<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.180> need<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.389> do<00:03:33.489> put<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
basically all you need to do put the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:43.240 
basically all you need to do put the
batteries<00:03:34.910> in<00:03:41.260> change<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.410> source<00:03:42.650> from<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
batteries in change the source from the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699 
batteries in change the source from the
rechargeable<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.239> alkaline<00:03:44.660> where<00:03:44.959> you

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
rechargeable to the alkaline where you

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.559 
rechargeable to the alkaline where you
know<00:03:45.880> even<00:03:46.880> though<00:03:46.940> they<00:03:47.060> are<00:03:47.180> rechargeable

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
know even though they are rechargeable

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.479 
know even though they are rechargeable
