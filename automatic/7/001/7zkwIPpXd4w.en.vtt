 to 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.930
 no no 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.969
 Welcome to 30 days drawing a 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.590
 new series of the channel in which during 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.660
 30 days I will do and upload the speed art of a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 Daily drawing based on the official list 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.020
 between quotes of the hashtag and good as 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.610
 you see in the title on day number 1 I 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.490
 play a self-portrait 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.780
 how do you see this series then good as 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.270
 you are watching is simply going to be 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.130
 simple drawings simple drawings that 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.350
 something faster they are not so elaborate 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.720
 as one does not mean that they are 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.440
 elaborated are very simple but they have 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.269
 your thing is worth 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.719
 but they are more short since it is one 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.260
 then what I'm going to do then 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.449
 is to follow the list that you can see the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.019
 many more cartoonists on twitter 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.940
 deviantart and other social networks 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.320
 Mogollon is in many pockets lot 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.350
 people doing this challenge 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 and what had not happened is that you can 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.910
 simply upload the photo to twitter or 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 the social trans that is because it does not 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.110
 I also have not much time to climb 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.330
 videos because I watch it recorded while 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
 drawing and then commented a bit with 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.170
 you a little talk like that more 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.970
 closest staff about then either 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.140
 the subject of the action or drawing 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 or about the channel or about 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.380
 some personal thing that I see 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 convenient so good as you are 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.350
 watching in the first episode 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.350
 we have a self-portrait what he wants 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.080
 say that I have drawn myself thing 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.509
 Good thing he did not call me much 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.950
 principle because yes I'm from drawing 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.740
 portraits because it's what I like the most 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.360
 draw here recital but I do not know draw 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.050
 to me it's like 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 a little weird is like that for me 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.470
 always in the drawings I always give them 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.510
 you want to give them a style smell I say 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.310
 in general because I guess all the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.460
 cartoonists all trap artists 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.770
 obviously they have their own style 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.950
 then draw a face is something maybe 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.360
 staff basically just not only for the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.800
 fact that you are drawing a person 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.590
 but also because you are apart giving 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.270
 a little your opinion about that person 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.850
 because when drawing something unless it's 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.840
 100% realistic and do it millimeter to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.150
 millimeter is worth 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.370
 a little bit you rely on your experience with 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.470
 that person in your what you think of her 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.780
 so 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 so you're giving your style how you want 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.100
 that is how you want people to see your 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.819
 I draw how you want people to see 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.969
 how do you see that person 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.390
 a bit complicated to think but but 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.640
 has its logic seriously 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.200
 then a little bit drawn to me 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.800
 It seemed a bit strange because it's like 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510
 give me an opinion about myself which 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.000
 is that it has not made me think it seems weird 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.030
 but 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.470
 it makes you think of what I do not know how to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.890
 you see yourself because it is to look at 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.550
 your own details and I do not know there's always 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:26.120
 that point of as shame as of 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.510
 fear of knowing who I am or not who 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.069
 I am but as I am a plan 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.069
 I am orc fucking 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.799
 then also because you have to give it a 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.520
 point that it looks like the person hey 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.490
 come out somebody decent and even if it's you 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.080
 very bad whatever it is because you always have 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.500
 that give you a style point and a point 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.540
 d 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.489
 has something 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.489
 people are not going to put you here either 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.860
 modify the face that looks like brad pitt 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.630
 the king you want us to look handsome 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.290
 but 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.080
 that's something that I see quite complicated 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.150
 in that sense, seek to find him that 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.250
 style so it's all for today this has 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.320
 been a rare little reflection like 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 you see in these videos I'm going to vary 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.650
 enough because I do not follow practically 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.509
 no script 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.970
 so I say a little what he thinks 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.840
 on the progress of the drawing and everything 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.810
 related to it 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.919
 for those who do not know I used a brush and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.630
 ballpoint pen as tools in the paint 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.750
 USAID brush for color ballpoint pen 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.130
 for strokes and concepts and others 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.180
 so I hope you liked it and if 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.130
 you want to see the following drawing you can 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.120
