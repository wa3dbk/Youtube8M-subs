00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.609 

I<00:00:24.270> think<00:00:25.270> either<00:00:25.630> way<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:25.930> looking<00:00:26.470> at<00:00:26.590> I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
I think either way you looking at I

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.019 
I think either way you looking at I
think<00:00:26.740> sometimes<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.460> takes<00:00:27.670> more<00:00:27.789> strength

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
think sometimes it takes more strength

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.510 
think sometimes it takes more strength
and<00:00:28.449> sometimes<00:00:28.689> we<00:00:29.080> try<00:00:29.289> not<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.770> play<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.220> way

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
and sometimes we try not to play a way

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.920 
and sometimes we try not to play a way
that<00:00:30.730> we<00:00:30.880> feel<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.270> with<00:00:31.420> him<00:00:31.539> in<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> game

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
that we feel that with him in the game

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.720 
that we feel that with him in the game
such<00:00:32.320> as<00:00:32.349> teams<00:00:33.040> like<00:00:33.220> Arsenal<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.699> Chelsea

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
such as teams like Arsenal and Chelsea

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.640 
such as teams like Arsenal and Chelsea
we<00:00:34.180> didn't<00:00:34.360> really<00:00:34.540> play<00:00:34.750> however<00:00:35.320> play

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
we didn't really play however play

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.689 
we didn't really play however play
normally<00:00:36.100> but<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.460> became

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
normally but it became

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.770 
normally but it became
some<00:00:39.699> time<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.969> play<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.269> way<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:40.600> would

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
some time to play the way that I would

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.209 
some time to play the way that I would
like<00:00:41.109> to<00:00:41.230> play<00:00:41.410> another<00:00:41.620> time<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:42.010> decorate

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
like to play another time to decorate

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:53.020 
like to play another time to decorate
just<00:00:42.579> depends<00:00:43.120> on<00:00:43.149> what<00:00:43.329> management

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.130 

probably<00:00:54.030> would<00:00:54.180> say<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.660> grew<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.960> watching

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
probably would say I grew up watching

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
probably would say I grew up watching
Terry<00:00:55.710> Murray<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.400> Arsenal<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.290> always

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
Terry Murray for Arsenal and so I always

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.350 
Terry Murray for Arsenal and so I always
used<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> watch<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.160> scoring<00:00:59.700> I<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.090> playful

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
used to watch your scoring I was playful

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.000 
used to watch your scoring I was playful
for<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.230> used<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.680> wish<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
for when I was used to get that I wish I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
for when I was used to get that I wish I
could<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.809> me

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
could do that to me

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
could do that to me
I<00:01:09.350> started<00:01:10.350> playing<00:01:10.440> football<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.160> was

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
hopefully when I was five six and then I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
hopefully when I was five six and then I
joined<00:01:16.800> ready<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.640> eight<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.660> I'm

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
afraid and all the way through the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.469

I<00:01:31.580> used<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.730> do<00:01:32.850> judo

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I used to do judo

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.219 
I used to do judo
when<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.440> very<00:01:34.560> young<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.550> quite<00:01:35.730> good

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
when I was very young that's quite good

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.150 
when I was very young that's quite good
but<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.410> just<00:01:37.590> had<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.800> make<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> decision

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
but then I just had to make the decision

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.800 
but then I just had to make the decision
on<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.870> do<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:53.210 

nothing<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.159> now<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.460> quite<00:01:45.580> small

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.010 

probably<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.300> main<00:01:54.450> goals<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
probably one of the main goals of the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
probably one of the main goals of the
team<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.860> promoted<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.790> when<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
team is to get promoted I think when we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
team is to get promoted I think when we
sat<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.660> at<00:01:57.960> beginning<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.530> year<00:01:58.650> we

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
sat down at beginning of the year we

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.110 
sat down at beginning of the year we
kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.160> said<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.580> where<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.910> want<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
kind of said like this where we want to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.190 
kind of said like this where we want to
be<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.510> what<00:02:00.690> we'll<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.980> as<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> team<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.900> gain

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
be as what we'll do so as a team to gain

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
be as what we'll do so as a team to gain
promotion<00:02:04.410> but<00:02:05.010> as<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.250> individual<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:06.000> maybe

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
promotion but as an individual or maybe

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.060 
promotion but as an individual or maybe
just<00:02:06.630> sustained<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.230> myself<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.920> English

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070

I don't think there's no point even
trying<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:55.160> but<00:02:56.160> obviously<00:02:56.490> being

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
trying to get there but obviously being

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
trying to get there but obviously being
around<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.210> seniors<00:02:57.570> now<00:02:57.720> -<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.200> my

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
around the seniors now - this is my

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.809 
around the seniors now - this is my
second<00:02:58.590> call<00:02:58.800> up

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
second call up

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.670 
second call up
with<00:03:00.689> the<00:03:00.780> second<00:03:01.079> corner<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.469> kind<00:03:01.650> of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
with the second corner that kind of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.289 
with the second corner that kind of
makes<00:03:01.890> me<00:03:02.069> want<00:03:02.219> to<00:03:02.280> motivate<00:03:02.700> myself<00:03:02.849> more<00:03:03.239> to

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
makes me want to motivate myself more to

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.750 
makes me want to motivate myself more to
be<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.689> that<00:03:03.810> plane<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.200> Canada<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.609> do

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
be on that plane to Canada and to do

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.209 
be on that plane to Canada and to do
that<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:11.930> think<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.499> we<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.829> think<00:03:14.099> we've

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
that I think what we have I think we've

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.170 
that I think what we have I think we've
got<00:03:14.340> loads<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.639> potential

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
got loads of potential

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.520 
got loads of potential
I<00:03:15.359> think<00:03:15.599> we've<00:03:15.780> obviously<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.200> friendly

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
I think we've obviously the friendly

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.020 
I think we've obviously the friendly
against<00:03:16.739> Sweden<00:03:16.889> next<00:03:17.340> week<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.639> think<00:03:17.879> it's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
against Sweden next week I think it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
against Sweden next week I think it's
going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.239> be<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> massive<00:03:18.719> game<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.200> that's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
going to be a massive game and that's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.899 
going to be a massive game and that's
just<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.709> go<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.829> show<00:03:20.129> where<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.579> are<00:03:20.609> at

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
just going to go to show where we are at

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.209 
just going to go to show where we are at
and<00:03:21.469> obviously<00:03:22.469> they<00:03:22.620> didn't<00:03:22.859> do<00:03:22.950> very<00:03:22.980> well

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
and obviously they didn't do very well

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.539 
and obviously they didn't do very well
in<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> Euro<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.319> thankfully<00:03:25.319> we<00:03:25.549> show

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
in the Euro so thankfully we show

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.250 
in the Euro so thankfully we show
ourselves<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:27.030> bit<00:03:27.180> more<00:03:27.389> show<00:03:27.719> how<00:03:27.930> could<00:03:28.109> be

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
ourselves a bit more show how could be

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.390 
ourselves a bit more show how could be
on<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.530> players<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.889> we've<00:03:29.010> put<00:03:29.159> in<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
on the players that we've put in the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.220 
on the players that we've put in the
squad<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.849> actually<00:03:30.239> her<00:03:30.629> breasts<00:03:30.870> are<00:03:31.079> in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
squad to actually her breasts are in

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
squad to actually her breasts are in
Canada<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.739> hopefully<00:03:32.129> maybe<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:32.909> away

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.520 

I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:40.269> it's<00:03:40.420> great<00:03:40.629> not<00:03:41.019> just<00:03:41.050> for<00:03:41.379> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
I think it's great not just for the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.140 
I think it's great not just for the
women<00:03:41.650> but<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:41.980> think<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> club<00:03:42.580> as<00:03:42.730> they

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
women but I think is the club as they

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.550 
women but I think is the club as they
kind<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.420> show<00:03:43.599> how<00:03:43.780> much<00:03:43.900> they're<00:03:44.140> supporting

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
kind of show how much they're supporting

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of show how much they're supporting
the<00:03:44.620> women<00:03:44.739> scene<00:03:45.069> which<00:03:45.220> they<00:03:45.370> are

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
the women scene which they are

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.630 
the women scene which they are
absolutely<00:03:46.690> great<00:03:46.840> towards<00:03:47.290> us<00:03:47.640> but

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
absolutely great towards us but

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.070 
absolutely great towards us but
obviously<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.330> go<00:03:49.480> there<00:03:49.720> some

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
obviously you get to go there some

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.839 
obviously you get to go there some
lovely<00:03:50.260> pitch<00:03:50.590> it's<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.099> fantastic<00:03:51.670> facility

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.490 

we're<00:03:54.480> all<00:03:54.629> quite<00:03:54.810> surprised<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.349> we<00:03:55.409> were

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
we're all quite surprised that we were

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.539 
we're all quite surprised that we were
allowed<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> play<00:03:55.920> here<00:03:56.099> actually<00:03:56.250> because

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
allowed to play here actually because

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.309 
allowed to play here actually because
obviously<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:57.090> pictures<00:03:57.480> as<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:57.930> haven't

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
obviously the pictures as they haven't

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.809 
obviously the pictures as they haven't
been<00:03:58.379> touched<00:03:58.560> yet<00:03:58.799> from<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.069> new<00:03:59.189> season<00:03:59.400> so

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
been touched yet from the new season so

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:13.530 
been touched yet from the new season so
I'm<00:04:00.030> really<00:04:00.209> excited

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.209 

the<00:04:13.720> feed<00:04:13.930> room<00:04:14.140> should<00:04:15.180> break<00:04:16.180> it
