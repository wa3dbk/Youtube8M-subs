00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
mine might still be kind of better i'm

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
mine might still be kind of better i'm
not<00:01:29.670> sure<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.020> reload<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.470> mine

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
not sure i know that the reload on mine

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
not sure i know that the reload on mine
is<00:01:31.950> superior<00:01:32.310> okay<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.390> does

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is superior okay so this thing does

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.620 
is superior okay so this thing does
actually<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.619> bass<00:01:34.890> range<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:36.210> my

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
actually have better bass range then my

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.620 
actually have better bass range then my
god<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.110> shotgun<00:01:37.500> um<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:39.060> stabilities

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
god to your shotgun um the stabilities

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.910 
god to your shotgun um the stabilities
basically<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:41.430> irrelevant<00:01:42.649> reloads<00:01:43.649> bit

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
basically it's irrelevant reloads bit

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
basically it's irrelevant reloads bit
slower<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.180> i<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.509> might<00:01:45.659> try<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> pick

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
slower but i think i might try to pick

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
slower but i think i might try to pick
up<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> shoddy<00:01:47.909> package
