00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.330
 to the girls finished products of the month 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.470
 the water crisis the micellar water of kiko 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 I personally don't like book there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.710
 those with a little is written that for skins 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 delicate 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 in my opinion not so much more to this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 dispenser ie point to another make one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.870
 residue here look at the cap sees everyone 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 these disgusting little brown pieces 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 here he went every day to clean these 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 light brown citrus fruits that are everywhere 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 it also makes me a bit disgusted 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.789
 more when I do so well too 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 tapping with the disk they joked 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.850
 I return three parts absolutely not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.729
 another finished product I wanted 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 try the makeup remover wipes 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 robert then lasts ninety gentle ones 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.220
 I found too little for me too 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.470
 soaked and above all me 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 personally they do not nip in the least 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 eyes but not makeup either 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 waterproof there is just fine ad 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.960
 to have passed on the face and certainly there 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 are some of card with wipes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 like my favors those of comodin 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.729
 that in a past take away too much with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.049
 these painful two or three then bonin e 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.920
 in my opinion suitable for a lot of skin 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.000
 sensitive but was not against a product 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 finished that I have is the eye makeup remover 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 express 2 in 1 of garnett the purple part 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 and the transparent part 125 ml of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.090
 product I found it for what 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 that is, it costs about 4 euros found a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.920
 excellent eye makeup remover eyes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
 sensitive to me does not burn did not give 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.079
 annoyance dissolved very well also 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.390
 waterproof makeup from both eyes and 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.369
 from the lips here it says that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.690
 and also fortifying eyelashes 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.480
 because there arginine actually no but 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.220
 however it is an excellent low cost makeup remover 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.170
 I did a detailed review on my own 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.819
 blog if you want to launch a look it 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 find then I leave you anyway link of 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.040
 blog below 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.340
 another finished shiseido product is 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.130
 the curling compact foundation that is the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.410
 compact foundation that usually comes out 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.150
 Summer I did not manage to bring 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.640
 at the end because for me it had become 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.590
 too dark he kindly finished the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 my boyfriend to cover a little cuper 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.680
 os that has on the cheeks in the color or in the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.690
 twelve grams of product over the port 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 sponge that never comes into contact 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.010
 with the product and of course like 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.220
 you see it completely finished I used it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 in summer go to the beach sincerely 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.390
 I was wrong because I bought the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.630
 one with protective factor there that 6 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.769
 practically does not co protect but there 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.620
 they are also with protection factor 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 high I used it at sea before maybe 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.850
 I was very tanned to have one 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.900
 appearance of color maybe it is buy or 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.150
 however, in the summer a finished product 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.579
 gift perfume of my boyfriend e 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.530
 the iceberg the iceberg tender white io 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.459
 I tend to not like the scents of 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.470
 iceberg 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.959
 but yes to the classic white that the tender 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.440
 white I loved him more 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.910
 they gave a bag with a bag that later 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.269
 I used a lot of white as a cosmetic bag 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.579
 nice also costs little on the 35 euros and 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.870
 were 100 ml 1 of your bed to me is 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.670
 liked but where they always buy 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.340
 arrested 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.930
 but your product ran out of fluid 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.480
 face to trip the action to the acid 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.880
 hyaluronic of the erbolario 28 billion 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.690
 produced this to be a gentleman 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.550
 of the erbolario actually costicchia 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.930
 the thing I did not expect that has one 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.730
 texture in oil 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.560
 so I really expected a real e 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.480
 own fluid or if I was actually 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.100
 I think it is wrong to call it fluid 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.230
 because the fluid has a texture 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.310
 milky fluid can indeed be 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.140
 real oil 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.730
 so much so that it is withdrawn with the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.600
 dropper 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.420
 good yes in my opinion very good for one 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.800
 wrinkled skin that is missing mixed then that 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.830
 does not like the structure of a product 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.660
 too thick but I like to try so many 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.910
 things so I won't buy it but it has me 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.570
 literally made this crazy 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.640
 line against nokia translation a 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.380
 other product terminated this time by 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.440
 green shop I don't know why I am 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.240
 persuaded him to take the hydra line 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.590
 life that is one of the latest releases on 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.420
 extraordinary moisturizing night balm 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.420
 I think it's one of the best products 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.350
 face that I tried of green shop 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.600
 made this way you see the finished 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.480
 problem is that for me it is really too much 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.610
 too oily, that is, even in the morning 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.550
 super bisunta meeting did not absorb it 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.290
 never is a line that even the oil 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.370
 thought is for dry skin then from 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.080
 hell is not good but it is a good product 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.210
 another finished product and that is 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560
 a little angry and my booty of 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.450
 astra 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.970
 I took one but I could do them 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.790
 see everyone is not that I finished it e 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.890
 that in these conditions that is two as 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.260
 the cement seems to be made of plastic 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.120
 all the strange pota I had left 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.880
 someone aside but three or four months 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.370
 still closed the petrified sky 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.500
 never opened I found them all in these 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.080
 conditions so I will never buy them 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.120
 more because if a product never opened yes 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.560
 it oxidizes in this way that is good that 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.510
 they are cheap but for me they are 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.250
 absolutely unusable I have them 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.410
 try them all under hot water 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.919
 mix it with oil nothing on from 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.040
 throw away the last finished product 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.020
 this blog by elizabeth arden 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.210
 in reality this would also not be of the 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.940
 all finished as you see the pec and the 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.620
 old collection is that unfortunately not 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.350
 it never happens to you but this time second 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.090
 me if it's too old it's from 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.480
 stay 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.240
 very little, however, it has the odor of old age 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.160
 so now the abandonment has remained there 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.520
 too much time because it has a color that does not 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.870
 I liked it and at 0 2 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.510
 I don't even know why I bought it 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.520
 anyway I felt like I was in Sardinia 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.010
 a red and reality took on a 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.250
 brownish color add me liked and 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.650
 also expired so hour is the last 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.240
 product is terminated is seems of the 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.550
 old line because now bionics has 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.550
 redone the packaging was the mascara e 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.040
 fake eyelashes effect that they have now 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.710
 redone with a beautiful pipe cleaner of 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.210
 those fir trees however these 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.100
 they were the call in brown color 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.880
 it is a mascara that I liked 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.680
 lot 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.419
 I like the mascara of goods that 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.669
 because I tolerate them very well too 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.260
 to stroke because some mascara me 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.760
 like them a lot but then we burn them 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.590
 eyes when I remove them and pass the 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.300
 want to put myself there and nick balance 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.570
 no more they also cost little 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.190
 noicom next i think neo boyfriend e 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.440
 I hope I have done something to see 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.900
 interestingly I send you a big kiss 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.479
