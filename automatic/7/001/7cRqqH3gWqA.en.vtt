00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.150 
tie a bowline I think you know somebody
back<00:00:13.300> up<00:00:13.510> we<00:00:13.690> used<00:00:13.870> a<00:00:13.990> lot<00:00:14.140> in<00:00:14.290> rescue<00:00:14.710> and<00:00:14.890> also

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
back up we used a lot in rescue and also

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.550 
back up we used a lot in rescue and also
in<00:00:15.280> climbing<00:00:15.760> we'll<00:00:16.630> give<00:00:16.780> you<00:00:16.870> some<00:00:17.050> examples

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
in climbing we'll give you some examples

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.930 
in climbing we'll give you some examples
of<00:00:17.680> how<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:17.890> use<00:00:18.040> it<00:00:18.160> at<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.580> end<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.850> this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
of how to use it at the end of this

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.420 
of how to use it at the end of this
video<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:20.410> we'll<00:00:20.650> show<00:00:20.680> you<00:00:20.830> how<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.070> tie<00:00:21.369> it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
video first we'll show you how to tie it

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.910 
video first we'll show you how to tie it
well<00:00:22.000> it's<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.150> type<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:23.380> direction<00:00:23.800> than

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
well it's a type one direction than

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.720 
well it's a type one direction than
another<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.630> first<00:00:25.870> you<00:00:26.050> wrap<00:00:26.260> around

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
another so first you wrap around

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.620 
another so first you wrap around
whatever<00:00:27.730> objects<00:00:28.270> you're<00:00:28.390> going<00:00:28.510> to<00:00:28.570> be

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
whatever objects you're going to be

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.010 
whatever objects you're going to be
tying<00:00:28.869> this<00:00:29.080> bowline<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.940> then<00:00:31.300> you<00:00:31.450> reach<00:00:31.720> in

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
tying this bowline and then you reach in

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.590 
tying this bowline and then you reach in
with<00:00:32.410> your<00:00:32.470> palm<00:00:32.860> facing<00:00:32.890> away<00:00:33.520> from<00:00:33.970> your

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
with your palm facing away from your

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.439 
with your palm facing away from your
body<00:00:35.010> towards<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.100> outside<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.850> then<00:00:37.420> you

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
body towards the outside and then you

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.799 
body towards the outside and then you
rotate<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.379> loop<00:00:38.620> or<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.250> rope<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
rotate the loop or the rope to the

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.100 
rotate the loop or the rope to the
outside<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:42.430> creates<00:00:42.850> this<00:00:43.000> loop<00:00:43.300> here<00:00:43.540> all

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
outside it creates this loop here all

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.770 
outside it creates this loop here all
you<00:00:44.320> do<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.770> reach<00:00:45.010> down<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.670> grab<00:00:46.329> up<00:00:46.660> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
you do is you reach down and grab up a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.630 
you do is you reach down and grab up a
little<00:00:47.079> bit<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:47.980> rope<00:00:48.160> that's<00:00:48.370> running

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
little bit of the rope that's running

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.000 
little bit of the rope that's running
behind<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.390> rest<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.780> Rope<00:00:50.010> you're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
behind you the rest of the Rope you're

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.460 
behind you the rest of the Rope you're
gonna<00:00:51.130> take<00:00:51.399> this<00:00:51.579> working<00:00:52.180> in<00:00:52.380> you're<00:00:53.380> gonna

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
gonna take this working in you're gonna

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.639 
gonna take this working in you're gonna
stick<00:00:53.829> it<00:00:53.980> inside<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.880> loop<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.649> you're

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
stick it inside that loop and you're

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.319 
stick it inside that loop and you're
gonna<00:00:56.739> fold<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.219> over<00:00:57.309> back<00:00:57.610> on<00:00:57.880> itself

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
gonna fold it over back on itself

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.020 
gonna fold it over back on itself
notice<00:00:58.630> I'd<00:00:58.750> let<00:00:58.930> go<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.290> this<00:00:59.469> part<00:00:59.770> I<00:01:00.040> don't

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
notice I'd let go of this part I don't

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.610 
notice I'd let go of this part I don't
need<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.270> hold<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:01.629> part<00:01:01.930> I'm<00:01:02.260> gonna<00:01:02.410> take

need to hold this part I'm gonna take
this<00:01:02.770> running<00:01:03.160> in<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.670> I'm<00:01:04.149> gonna<00:01:04.300> pull<00:01:04.750> that

back<00:01:05.440> through<00:01:05.740> when<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:06.729> do<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.149> that<00:01:07.330> cinches

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
back through when I do that that cinches

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.740 
back through when I do that that cinches
down<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.440> gives<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.369> your<00:01:09.430> bowline<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.539> for

this leg that is and from underneath
we're<00:01:19.600> gonna<00:01:19.690> follow<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.619> one<00:01:20.890> across<00:01:21.340> the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
we're gonna follow this one across the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.260 
we're gonna follow this one across the
top<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:22.810> want<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.110> follow<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:24.100> all<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:25.150> way

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
top we want to follow this all the way

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.440 
top we want to follow this all the way
back<00:01:25.510> out<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.680> want<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.890> make<00:01:27.010> sure<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
back out and you want to make sure that

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.539 
back out and you want to make sure that
this<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.260> inside<00:01:29.770> when<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.159> follow<00:01:30.400> it

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
this is to the inside when you follow it

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.179 
this is to the inside when you follow it
out<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.180> inside<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.049> one<00:01:32.290> and

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
out as to the inside of this one and

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.880 
out as to the inside of this one and
that<00:01:33.400> creates<00:01:33.850> your<00:01:34.150> bowline<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
that creates your bowline for the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.660 
that creates your bowline for the
Yosemite<00:01:36.520> back<00:01:36.700> up<00:01:38.009> okay<00:01:39.009> let's<00:01:39.280> take<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.460> look

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
Yosemite back up okay let's take a look

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.800 
Yosemite back up okay let's take a look
at<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:39.880> from<00:01:40.180> going<00:01:40.390> from<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.600> other

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
at that from going from the other

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.260 
at that from going from the other
direction<00:01:41.520> let's<00:01:42.520> say<00:01:42.670> we<00:01:42.790> go<00:01:42.909> around<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
direction let's say we go around the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.200 
direction let's say we go around the
tree<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.659> way<00:01:47.400> still<00:01:48.400> doesn't<00:01:48.729> matter<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.090> do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
tree this way still doesn't matter we do

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.600 
tree this way still doesn't matter we do
the<00:01:49.330> same<00:01:49.509> thing<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:50.049> take<00:01:50.259> our<00:01:50.409> hand<00:01:50.619> palm

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the same thing we take our hand palm

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.870 
the same thing we take our hand palm
facing<00:01:52.090> out<00:01:52.240> we<00:01:52.900> rotate<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.619> what<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.640> does

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
facing out we rotate it what that does

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.080 
facing out we rotate it what that does
is<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.240> gives<00:01:55.360> us<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.780> loop<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:57.490> reach<00:01:57.759> down

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
is it gives us this loop we reach down

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.550 
is it gives us this loop we reach down
through<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.450> loop<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:58.990> grab<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.320> ropes

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
through this loop and grab the ropes

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.490 
through this loop and grab the ropes
it's<00:01:59.829> running<00:02:00.189> back<00:02:00.460> away<00:02:00.790> from<00:02:01.090> us<00:02:01.259> I've<00:02:02.259> been

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
it's running back away from us I've been
