 lesson options and part time 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 art education or secondary education

 at one in a school that is 350 years old 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.160

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.070
 about the history of the contemporary 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.740
 art where I do so I specialize 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 very strong in historical approach to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.700
 waste whisks from the 19th and 20th centuries and 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.150
 the intention is a bit more than young 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.909
 to see artists in the course 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.659
 from actress universe very radical 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.820
 subversive currents were in the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.960
 art that would both art 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 ask society a question 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.870
 that range of training courses 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.790
 naturally results in a whole 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.680
 specific professional profiles 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.170
 a fashion designer is by definition 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.660
 someone other than someone who is for 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.060
 theater our teachings 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.160
 worked out could design chair costumes so 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.960
 it is very broad and varied 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.960
 range of appeal options 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.220
 i follow free graph 3 so was the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 old printing technology from the past such as 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.330
 etcher lithographer smears your skin 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.310
 everyone comes together often 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.440
 memorable moment that there are and 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.290

 fed over old not about working 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.750
 Things are exhibited while they are 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 in the yes moments are those that do it 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.830
 most often 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.190
 the academy is actually a whole 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.660
 ambivalent institute it's an old one here 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.460
 monastery buildings that you go that the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.170
 middle ages in the time of napoleon ge 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.420

 here literally and figuratively in the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.740
 hallways but the hall hangs at the same time 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.390
 at that how historic place see young 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.520
 people are constantly busy with them 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.410
 creativity thinking about forms of 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.810
 days of all future 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.430
 it is that constant interaction that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.500
 constant tension between the past 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.260
 and the future between tradition and 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.630
 experiment that I think is kind of yes 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.630
 u not cause climate
