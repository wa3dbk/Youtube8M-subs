00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.060 

the<00:00:34.290> scale<00:00:34.790> was<00:00:35.790> intended<00:00:36.890> what<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the scale was intended what is the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the sizes of the strings for instance

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.389 
the sizes of the strings for instance
these<00:00:44.399> strings<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:46.399> are

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
these strings that are down here are

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.549 
these strings that are down here are
different<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> size<00:00:48.510> our<00:00:48.840> diameter<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
strings up here these strings are also

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
strings up here these strings are also
much<00:00:52.320> shorter<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> whole<00:00:55.789> assembly<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
much shorter so that whole assembly of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
much shorter so that whole assembly of
strings<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.930> lowest<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.469> highest

strings from the lowest to the highest

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.779 
strings from the lowest to the highest
is<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> call<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> scale<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.410> au<00:01:01.410> piano

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
is what we call the scale and au piano

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.630 
is what we call the scale and au piano
companies<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:03.170> devised<00:01:04.170> scales<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.460> their

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
companies have devised scales for their

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.480 
companies have devised scales for their
pianos<00:01:06.119> according<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> how<00:01:07.049> long<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.710> or

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
pianos according to how long they are or

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.300 
pianos according to how long they are or
how<00:01:09.030> short<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.530> over<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
how short they are and over here on the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.020 
how short they are and over here on the
table<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> bases<00:01:13.670> these<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.000> course

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
table we see the bases these of course

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.830 
table we see the bases these of course
are<00:01:15.509> very<00:01:15.930> thick<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.640> they'll<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:18.390> heavier

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
are very thick and they'll have heavier

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.460 
are very thick and they'll have heavier
mass<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.830> produce<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> low<00:01:22.140> tones

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
mass to produce the kind of low tones

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.510 
mass to produce the kind of low tones
that<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.189> get

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that we need to get

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.959 
that we need to get
the<00:01:23.759> base<00:01:23.969> section<00:01:24.630> okay<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.549> very<00:01:26.729> much

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
the base section okay so it's very much

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.520 
the base section okay so it's very much
like<00:01:27.030> an<00:01:27.329> orchestra<00:01:27.719> where<00:01:28.079> you<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.500> your

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like an orchestra where you have your

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
like an orchestra where you have your
Piccolo's<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.310> fights<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> top

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Piccolo's and fights up here in the top

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.940 
Piccolo's and fights up here in the top
with<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.039> very<00:01:32.399> short<00:01:33.299> resonators<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.829> we

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
with a very short resonators and here we

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
with a very short resonators and here we
have<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.219> short<00:01:35.460> strings<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.569> we<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have very short strings and we have the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.859 
have very short strings and we have the
double<00:01:37.350> basses<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.060> end<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.689> then

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
double basses on the other end and then

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.730 
double basses on the other end and then
everything's<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> string<00:01:41.100> orchestra<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
everything's in the string orchestra so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.240 
everything's in the string orchestra so
you<00:01:43.829> call<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.189> piano<00:01:44.369> company<00:01:44.880> Yamaha<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.250> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you call the piano company Yamaha and so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.359 
you call the piano company Yamaha and so
I<00:01:47.659> wanted<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:48.899> sure<00:01:48.959> that<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.100> scale

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I wanted to make sure that the scale

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
I wanted to make sure that the scale
that<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.569> you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.679> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that was on this you know was the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.830 
that was on this you know was the
original<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.689> never<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.319> assume

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
original because I never want to assume

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.779 
original because I never want to assume
because<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.289> may<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.829> had<00:01:59.130> some<00:01:59.489> work<00:01:59.759> done

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
because it may have had some work done

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.539 
because it may have had some work done
to<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.539> replacing<00:02:01.229> strings<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.340> just

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to it and replacing strings and I just

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.889 
to it and replacing strings and I just
want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.789> make<00:02:02.880> sure<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.239> I<00:02:03.569> have<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
want to make sure that I have the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740 
want to make sure that I have the
original<00:02:04.560> scale<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.489> was<00:02:05.729> intended<00:02:06.390> for

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
original scale that was intended for

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.289 
original scale that was intended for
this<00:02:06.840> instrument<00:02:09.440> Jamie<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.880> right<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
this instrument Jamie so right now you

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.229 
this instrument Jamie so right now you
are<00:02:12.480> pulling<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.019> wires<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.650> piano

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
are pulling the wires out of the piano

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.720 
are pulling the wires out of the piano
and<00:02:15.239> those<00:02:15.480> are<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.630> old<00:02:15.780> wires<00:02:16.049> are<00:02:16.349> done

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and those are the old wires are done

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.190 
and those are the old wires are done
right<00:02:17.730> these<00:02:18.180> are<00:02:18.329> done<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.900> ever<00:02:18.989> make

strings on it and for her to kind of
play<00:02:33.299> with<00:02:33.389> like<00:02:34.139> this<00:02:34.470> sounds<00:02:35.250> silly<00:02:35.400> but

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
play with like this sounds silly but

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.420 
play with like this sounds silly but

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
thing that will happen then you'll clear

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.009 
thing that will happen then you'll clear
all<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.440> strings<00:02:43.709> out<00:02:43.889> of<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.069> piano<00:02:44.310> and
