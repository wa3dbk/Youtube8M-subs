on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.009> thing<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.509> decide<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
on the first thing you can decide on the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.830 
on the first thing you can decide on the
luminex<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.340> output<00:01:11.700> level<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.420> how<00:01:12.659> many

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
luminex the output level of how many

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
luminex the output level of how many
lumix<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.399> say<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.670> example<00:01:14.790> i

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
lumix that you want so say for example i

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.830 
lumix that you want so say for example i
can<00:01:15.360> track<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.409> type<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:18.000> fifty

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
can track or just type it I want fifty

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960 
can track or just type it I want fifty
percent<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.840 

21st<00:01:22.720> birthday<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:24.460> place<00:01:24.640> you've

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
21st birthday so that place you've

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
21st birthday so that place you've
roughly<00:01:25.450> about<00:01:25.890> three<00:01:26.910> roughly<00:01:27.910> about<00:01:28.000> 450

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
roughly about three roughly about 450

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.200 
roughly about three roughly about 450
limits<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:30.070> then<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.550> second<00:01:30.880> thing<00:01:31.030> you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
limits and then on the second thing you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.320 
limits and then on the second thing you
can<00:01:31.450> design<00:01:31.960> your<00:01:32.310> frequency<00:01:33.310> level<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.240> you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
can design your frequency level so you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.450 
can design your frequency level so you
can<00:01:34.480> decide<00:01:34.630> basically<00:01:35.260> companies<00:01:35.680> stroke<00:01:36.280> a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
can decide basically companies stroke a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.260 
can decide basically companies stroke a
second<00:01:38.040> okay<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.100> if<00:01:39.550> i<00:01:39.700> set<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:39.970> on<00:01:40.240> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
second okay so if i set it on the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.830 
second okay so if i set it on the
