00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
driver less install it works with Macs

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.490 
driver less install it works with Macs
and<00:00:35.730> PCs<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.630> he<00:00:36.750> says<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.380> work

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and PCs and as he says here to do work
