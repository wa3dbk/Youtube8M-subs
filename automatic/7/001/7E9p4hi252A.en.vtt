over<00:00:08.880> here<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.540> if<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.019> give<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> camera<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
over here and if I give the camera a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.919 
over here and if I give the camera a
whack<00:00:11.070> we'll<00:00:11.790> start<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> see<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.420> picture<00:00:12.690> show

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
whack we'll start to see a picture show

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
whack we'll start to see a picture show
up<00:00:13.110> now<00:00:13.830> if<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.980> go<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.099> game-mode<00:00:14.519> three

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
up now if I go to game-mode three

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.460 
up now if I go to game-mode three
spectator<00:00:15.420> mode<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.049> what's<00:00:16.260> going

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
spectator mode we can see what's going

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.529 
spectator mode we can see what's going
on<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.859> called<00:00:16.980> ray<00:00:17.279> tracing<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.970> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
on this is called ray tracing and you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
on this is called ray tracing and you
see<00:00:18.720> whenever<00:00:18.960> an<00:00:19.380> armor<00:00:19.650> stand<00:00:19.680> which<00:00:20.550> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
see whenever an armor stand which is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.250 
see whenever an armor stand which is
emanating<00:00:20.970> from<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> camera<00:00:21.630> hits<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.990> block

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
emanating from the camera hits a block

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.890 
emanating from the camera hits a block
it's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.340> sort<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> disappears<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.600> copies

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
it's a sort of disappears and copies

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.830 
it's a sort of disappears and copies
that<00:00:25.080> block<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.560> onto<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> canvas<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.840> so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that block up onto the canvas and so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
that block up onto the canvas and so
since<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> armor<00:00:29.039> stands<00:00:29.279> are

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
since all of the armor stands are

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.420 
since all of the armor stands are
emanating<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:31.949> armor<00:00:32.189> stand

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
emanating from this this one armor stand

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.410 
emanating from this this one armor stand
here<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.450> sort<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:35.070> perspective<00:00:35.910> from

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
here we sort of get a perspective from

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.810 
here we sort of get a perspective from
this<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:38.160> armor<00:00:38.399> stands<00:00:38.579> point<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this this this armor stands point of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.750 
this this this armor stands point of
view<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.250> actual

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
view and and so we get actual

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.250 
view and and so we get actual
perspective<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.360> things<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.780> closer<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
perspective so things that are closer to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
perspective so things that are closer to
the<00:00:43.350> camera<00:00:43.530> appear<00:00:44.309> bigger<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> canvas

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the camera appear bigger on the canvas

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
the camera appear bigger on the canvas
things<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.719> farther<00:00:45.960> away<00:00:46.110> appear

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
things that are farther away appear

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.569 
things that are farther away appear
smaller<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.920> here's<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> finished<00:00:47.460> picture

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
smaller so here's the finished picture

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
smaller so here's the finished picture
you<00:00:48.510> notice<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> well<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:49.980> big<00:00:50.100> as

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you notice the well is about as big as

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
you notice the well is about as big as
the<00:00:50.399> camera<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:50.940> sorry<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.239> bad<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the camera or sorry as bad as big as the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
the camera or sorry as bad as big as the
house<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> picture<00:00:52.649> even<00:00:53.219> though

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
house in the picture even though

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.799 
house in the picture even though
obviously<00:00:53.520> there<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.180> different<00:00:54.329> sizes

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
obviously there are very different sizes

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
obviously there are very different sizes
but<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:56.190> one's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> lot

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
but that's because this one's a lot

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
but that's because this one's a lot
closer<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> we've<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.140> streetlamp

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
closer and we've got the streetlamp

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
closer and we've got the streetlamp
partially<00:00:59.010> obscured<00:00:59.460> by<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.149> well<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:02.090> yeah

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
partially obscured by that well and yeah

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
partially obscured by that well and yeah
so<00:01:03.449> works<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:03.960> well<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.240> path<00:01:06.240> here

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so works pretty well the the path here

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
so works pretty well the the path here
coming<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> house<00:01:07.260> looks<00:01:08.010> straight

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
coming out of the house looks straight

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.410 
coming out of the house looks straight
if<00:01:08.549> you're<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.760> looking<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> straight<00:01:09.360> on

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
if you're just looking at it straight on

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
if you're just looking at it straight on
but<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> cameras<00:01:10.619> point<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> view<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
but from this cameras point of view it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
but from this cameras point of view it
has<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> tilted<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.780> towards

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
has it is tilted a little bit towards

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.359 
has it is tilted a little bit towards
the<00:01:13.229> outside<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.920> away<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the outside as you go away from the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
the outside as you go away from the
house<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:14.850> exactly<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.570> now

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
house and that's exactly what we see now

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
house and that's exactly what we see now
this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.409> actually<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.740> mirror<00:01:16.920> image<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
this is actually a mirror image if you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
this is actually a mirror image if you
come<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.049> image<00:01:19.320> as

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
come back here you can see the image as

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
come back here you can see the image as
we<00:01:19.890> saw<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> cameras<00:01:20.790> point<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> view

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
we saw it from the cameras point of view

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.649 
we saw it from the cameras point of view
just<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.560> side<00:01:22.880> let<00:01:23.880> me<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.479> show

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
just on the other side let me to show

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
just on the other side let me to show
you<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> system<00:01:25.110> smoking<00:01:25.590> mirrors<00:01:25.830> let

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you that the system smoking mirrors let

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
you that the system smoking mirrors let
me<00:01:26.070> place<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> few<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.299> blocks<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:28.170> I'll<00:01:28.439> put

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
me place a few more blocks down I'll put

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.460 
me place a few more blocks down I'll put
some<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.549> redstone<00:01:29.970> blocks<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.990> into

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
some some redstone blocks into the into

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.270 
some some redstone blocks into the into
the<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.220> picture<00:01:32.610> maybe<00:01:33.570> put<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.350> here

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the the picture maybe put some back here

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
the the picture maybe put some back here
behind<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> well<00:01:36.600> let's<00:01:37.409> make<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.799> arch

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
behind the well let's make a little arch

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.319 
behind the well let's make a little arch
here<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.850> let's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here back here and and then let's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.969 
here back here and and then let's
predict<00:01:42.659> what's<00:01:42.840> gonna<00:01:42.899> happen<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
predict what's gonna happen what the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.569 
predict what's gonna happen what the
camera<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.540> coming<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
camera should see so coming over here so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
camera should see so coming over here so
we<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> arch<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
we have this arch in the back it's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
we have this arch in the back it's
partially<00:01:49.439> obscured<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.890> glowstone<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
partially obscured by the glowstone and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.350 
partially obscured by the glowstone and
by<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> lamp<00:01:51.840> post<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> probably<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.180> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
by the lamp post this is probably not in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
by the lamp post this is probably not in
the<00:01:54.450> field<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> view<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> can't

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the field of view because well I can't

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
the field of view because well I can't
see<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:56.850> looking<00:01:56.939> forward<00:01:57.390> then

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
see it when I'm looking forward then

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.959 
see it when I'm looking forward then
this<00:01:58.590> should<00:01:58.920> partially<00:01:59.460> obscure<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> well

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this should partially obscure the well

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.280 
this should partially obscure the well
this<00:02:00.270> should<00:02:00.479> partially<00:02:00.869> obscure<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this should partially obscure the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.609 
this should partially obscure the
doorway<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.340> pathway<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.409> well<00:02:04.409> let's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
doorway and the pathway and well let's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.959 
doorway and the pathway and well let's
see<00:02:04.770> let's<00:02:04.979> take<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> picture

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
see let's take the picture

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.719 
see let's take the picture
so<00:02:06.119> it'll<00:02:06.750> refresh<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> can

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so it'll refresh and back there you can

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
so it'll refresh and back there you can
actually<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.239> line<00:02:09.479> by<00:02:09.629> line<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:10.200> its

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
actually see line by line as its

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
actually see line by line as its
capturing<00:02:11.160> what's<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.239> on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
capturing what's going on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.839 
capturing what's going on
and<00:02:13.620> yeah<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.099> pretty<00:02:14.190> much<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.670> see

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
and yeah that's pretty much what we see

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.460 
and yeah that's pretty much what we see
actually<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.239> whole<00:02:15.360> doorway<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.840> obscured

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
actually the whole doorway is obscured

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.020 
actually the whole doorway is obscured
I<00:02:16.500> guess<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.129> taking<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.489> from<00:02:17.610> maybe<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I guess it's taking it from maybe a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.149 
I guess it's taking it from maybe a
little<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.299> lower<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.840> down<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.560> taking

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
little bit lower like down here taking

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.190 
little bit lower like down here taking
it<00:02:20.220> from<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> base<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.120> armor<00:02:21.629> stand<00:02:21.870> here

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
it from the base of the armor stand here

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
it from the base of the armor stand here
so<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.670> base<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> armor<00:02:24.239> stand<00:02:24.299> is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so the base of the armor stand is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
so the base of the armor stand is
actually<00:02:24.840> what<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> perspective<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
actually what the perspective that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.910 
actually what the perspective that
matters<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.989> doorways<00:02:28.379> obscured

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
matters but so the doorways obscured

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.190 
matters but so the doorways obscured
well<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.549> have<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.909> have<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.180> thing<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
well so we have we have this thing the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.710 
well so we have we have this thing the
arch<00:02:31.379> we<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.129> see<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.549> obscured<00:02:32.940> by<00:02:33.000> both<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
arch we can see is obscured by both the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.199 
arch we can see is obscured by both the
lamppost<00:02:34.099> well<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.250> behind<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:35.849> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
lamppost well it behind the well and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.479 
lamppost well it behind the well and
also<00:02:36.510> by<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.409> actual<00:02:37.709> glowstone<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.310> lamp

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
also by the actual glowstone in the lamp

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.780 
also by the actual glowstone in the lamp
oh<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:39.629> we<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.810> also<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:41.069> we

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
oh so and then we can also see the we

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.069 
oh so and then we can also see the we
can't<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.379> this<00:02:43.379> pillar<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:44.970> above<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
can't see this pillar from above the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.270 
can't see this pillar from above the
well<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.500> can't<00:02:46.709> see<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:46.890> through<00:02:47.099> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
well but we can't see it through the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.190 
well but we can't see it through the
well<00:02:47.400> let's<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.390> about<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.870> yeah<00:02:49.079> we

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
well let's see what about that yeah we

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.199 
well let's see what about that yeah we
can<00:02:49.230> see<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.560> through<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> well<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.400> think

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
can see it through the well so I think

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.630 
can see it through the well so I think
it<00:02:51.269> worked<00:02:51.390> pretty<00:02:51.540> well<00:02:52.010> that's<00:02:53.010> very<00:02:53.370> nice

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it worked pretty well that's very nice

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.490 
it worked pretty well that's very nice
so<00:02:53.849> now<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.329> see<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.109> does<00:02:55.290> work

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
so now you can see that it does work

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.349 
so now you can see that it does work
it's<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.790> had<00:02:56.970> those<00:02:57.090> blocks

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
it's not like I had those blocks

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.289 
it's not like I had those blocks
pre-planned<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.170> anything<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.709> have<00:02:59.099> this

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
pre-planned or anything I have this

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.479 
pre-planned or anything I have this
abstract<00:03:00.299> sculpture<00:03:01.140> sculpture<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.250> lines

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
abstract sculpture sculpture of lines

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.849 
abstract sculpture sculpture of lines
here<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:03.450> gonna<00:03:03.599> go<00:03:03.750> ahead<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.049> let's<00:03:04.650> reset

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
here I'm gonna go ahead and let's reset

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.330 
here I'm gonna go ahead and let's reset
the<00:03:05.459> redstone<00:03:06.000> here<00:03:06.440> let<00:03:07.440> me<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the redstone here let me I think the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920 
the redstone here let me I think the
camera<00:03:08.609> over<00:03:08.790> here<00:03:08.819> disappeared<00:03:09.450> yep<00:03:09.750> it's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
camera over here disappeared yep it's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.410 
camera over here disappeared yep it's
gone<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.519> let's<00:03:11.519> let's<00:03:11.940> go<00:03:12.030> ahead<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.329> give

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
gone and let's let's go ahead and give

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.170 
gone and let's let's go ahead and give
us<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.569> whack<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.109> it'll<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> picture<00:03:14.180> from

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
us a whack and it'll take a picture from

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.909 
us a whack and it'll take a picture from
our<00:03:15.480> perspective<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.140> looks<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.859> a

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
our perspective this looks like just a

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.069 
our perspective this looks like just a
weird<00:03:17.099> set<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> lines<00:03:17.669> but<00:03:18.000> from<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> cameras

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
weird set of lines but from the cameras

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.479 
weird set of lines but from the cameras
perspective<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.599> know<00:03:21.720> it's

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
perspective it's you know it's

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.870 
perspective it's you know it's
interpreting<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.639> as<00:03:23.849> if<00:03:24.500> well<00:03:25.519> as<00:03:26.519> if<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:26.790> was

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
interpreting it as if well as if it was

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.250 
interpreting it as if well as if it was
a<00:03:26.910> picture<00:03:27.209> from<00:03:27.510> from<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.930> point<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.200> view

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
a picture from from that point of view

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.140 
a picture from from that point of view
and<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.129> we<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.340> start<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.700> see<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.910> figure

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and so we can start to see a figure

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.270 
and so we can start to see a figure
emerge<00:03:30.540> even<00:03:31.410> though<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.650> looks<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.250> know

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
emerge even though it looks you know

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.720 
emerge even though it looks you know
very<00:03:32.669> different<00:03:33.030> from<00:03:33.120> here<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.669> is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
very different from here and so this is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.270 
very different from here and so this is
there's<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.180> figure<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.919> come<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
there's this figure and if we come to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.170 
there's this figure and if we come to
stand<00:03:38.459> right<00:03:38.519> here<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:38.849> is<00:03:38.970> what<00:03:39.090> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
stand right here this is what it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.000 
stand right here this is what it
actually<00:03:39.209> sees<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:40.620> see<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:40.859> very

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
actually sees you can see it's very

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.890 
actually sees you can see it's very
similar<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.639> thing<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.629> around<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
similar to this thing if I go around to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.309 
similar to this thing if I go around to
the<00:03:42.959> back<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.319> course<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.720> yeah<00:03:45.720> works

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
the back of course then it's yeah works

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.680 
the back of course then it's yeah works
pretty<00:03:46.470> well<00:03:46.639> so<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.879> lot<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.209> command<00:03:48.510> blocks

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
pretty well so a lot of command blocks

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.309 
pretty well so a lot of command blocks
involved<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.590> lot<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.099> shenanigans<00:03:51.109> but<00:03:52.109> I

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
involved a lot of shenanigans but I

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.379 
involved a lot of shenanigans but I
think<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> effect<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.430> pretty<00:03:53.609> cool<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
think the effect is pretty cool the

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.360 
think the effect is pretty cool the
camera<00:03:54.690> can<00:03:54.810> only<00:03:54.870> take<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.139> picture<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:56.099> one

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
camera can only take a picture in one

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.879 
camera can only take a picture in one
direction<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:57.379> it<00:03:58.379> kind<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.560> has<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.739> have

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
direction and it kind of has to have

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.189 
direction and it kind of has to have
fixed<00:03:59.190> coordinates<00:03:59.760> in<00:04:00.090> order<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.959> pace

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
fixed coordinates in order to to pace

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.220 
fixed coordinates in order to to pace
the<00:04:01.440> blocks<00:04:01.709> into<00:04:02.129> so<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:03.989> that's<00:04:04.109> pretty

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
the blocks into so but that's pretty

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.479 
the blocks into so but that's pretty
much<00:04:04.379> how<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.560> works<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.889> ray<00:04:05.010> tracing<00:04:05.040> is

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
much how it works the ray tracing is

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.240 
much how it works the ray tracing is
definitely<00:04:05.849> pretty<00:04:06.030> cool<00:04:06.829> let<00:04:07.829> me<00:04:07.919> just<00:04:08.129> show

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
definitely pretty cool let me just show

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.119 
definitely pretty cool let me just show
you<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.579> more<00:04:08.639> time<00:04:09.109> cuz<00:04:10.109> I<00:04:10.500> think<00:04:11.040> it

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
you that one more time cuz I think it

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.740 
you that one more time cuz I think it
looks<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.340> cool<00:04:11.669> so<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.299> see<00:04:12.449> it<00:04:12.569> that

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
looks really cool so you can see it that

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.119 
looks really cool so you can see it that
at<00:04:12.959> first<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.470> kind<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.739> hitting<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
at first it's kind of hitting the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.490 
at first it's kind of hitting the
grounds<00:04:14.579> that's<00:04:14.790> what<00:04:15.269> we're<00:04:15.389> seeing<00:04:15.540> here<00:04:15.629> if

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
grounds that's what we're seeing here if

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.020 
grounds that's what we're seeing here if
it<00:04:16.650> doesn't<00:04:16.919> hit<00:04:17.099> anything<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:17.849> that's

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
it doesn't hit anything then that's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.909 
it doesn't hit anything then that's
where<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.269> get<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.510> snow<00:04:18.720> from<00:04:19.019> right<00:04:19.349> there's

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
where we get the snow from right there's

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.830 
where we get the snow from right there's
a<00:04:20.010> certain<00:04:20.459> maximum<00:04:20.789> view<00:04:21.180> distance<00:04:21.539> which<00:04:21.719> is

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
a certain maximum view distance which is

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.930 
a certain maximum view distance which is
set<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.169> 20<00:04:22.440> meters<00:04:22.680> here<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.669> see

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
set to 20 meters here and you can see

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.340 
set to 20 meters here and you can see
wherever<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.630> does<00:04:24.750> hit<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:24.990> coal<00:04:25.229> blocks

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
wherever it does hit the coal blocks

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.900 
wherever it does hit the coal blocks
it's<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.830> armor<00:04:27.250> stand<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.580> just<00:04:27.760> being

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
it's the armor stand is just being

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.090 
it's the armor stand is just being
destroyed<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.410> block<00:04:29.620> has<00:04:29.800> been<00:04:29.920> clocked

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
destroyed and the block has been clocked

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.220 
destroyed and the block has been clocked
copied<00:04:30.580> up<00:04:30.670> there

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
copied up there

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.660 
copied up there
that's<00:04:32.230> how<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.380> works<00:04:32.620> that's<00:04:33.280> about<00:04:33.400> it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
that's how it works that's about it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.090 
that's how it works that's about it
thanks<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.030> watching
