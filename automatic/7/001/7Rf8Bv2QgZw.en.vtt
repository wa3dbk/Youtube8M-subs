we know math isn't really my strong

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100 
we know math isn't really my strong
point<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.700> figure<00:02:04.120> if<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.270> play<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.659> top<00:02:04.810> line

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
I'll get like 30 goals 40 cysts that's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.310 
I'll get like 30 goals 40 cysts that's
about<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.039> hundred<00:02:09.310> points<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.700> figure<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
about a hundred points I figure so

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.449 
about a hundred points I figure so
what's<00:02:11.500> changed<00:02:11.560> since<00:02:12.070> then

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
what's changed since then

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.550 
what's changed since then
well<00:02:12.850> at<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.030> time<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> thought<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.990> know<00:02:14.260> this

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
well at the time I thought you know this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.600 
well at the time I thought you know this
is<00:02:14.709> what<00:02:14.860> would<00:02:14.950> have<00:02:15.040> been<00:02:15.160> best<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
is what would have been best for the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.020 
is what would have been best for the
team<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.200> after<00:02:18.190> some<00:02:18.459> hard

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
team but you know after some hard

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.640 
team but you know after some hard
thinking<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.870> probably<00:02:20.140> where<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.320> belong

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
thinking this is probably where I belong

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
thinking this is probably where I belong
right<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.310> helping<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> team

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
right now and I'm helping on the team

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.540 
right now and I'm helping on the team
that<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.300> Belak<00:02:23.140> says<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.560> has<00:02:23.740> nothing<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.310> do

that way Belak says it has nothing to do

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
right now and I'm happy doing it but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.210 
right now and I'm happy doing it but
don't<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.680> could<00:02:35.709> make<00:02:35.980> more

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
