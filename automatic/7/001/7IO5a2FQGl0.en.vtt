00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
360 degree rotational it's nice and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.480 
360 degree rotational it's nice and
fluid<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> bubble<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.740> there

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
fluid and there is a bubble right there

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.080 
fluid and there is a bubble right there

that helps you level out legs and here's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
that helps you level out legs and here's
the<00:01:15.270> front<00:01:16.020> platform<00:01:16.409> where<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.250> mount

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the front platform where you can mount

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
the front platform where you can mount
the<00:01:17.700> camera<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> used<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.350> when

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the camera that's what I used to do when

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.670 
the camera that's what I used to do when
I<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> Jeep<00:01:20.390> but<00:01:21.619> recently<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
I first got the Jeep but recently I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.420 
I first got the Jeep but recently I
decided<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.310> try<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.970> use<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.659> fluid<00:01:25.619> head<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
decided to try and use a fluid head on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.480 
decided to try and use a fluid head on
the<00:01:26.610> front<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.590> find<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.130> it's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the front and I actually find that it's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.679 
the front and I actually find that it's
a<00:01:29.729> better<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.869> control<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.860> tilt<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
a better way to control your tilt and

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.440 
a better way to control your tilt and
you<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> additional<00:01:34.799> pan<00:01:35.450> which

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you also get the additional pan which

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710 
you also get the additional pan which
you<00:01:36.630> can't<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.229> without<00:01:38.040> an<00:01:38.369> additional<00:01:39.360> head

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you can't get without an additional head

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.889 
you can't get without an additional head
on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> front<00:01:40.490> some<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.759> children<00:01:42.390> can

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
on the front some of these children can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.410 
on the front some of these children can
be<00:01:43.049> done<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> handle<00:01:45.149> right

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
be done just with this handle right

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.069 
be done just with this handle right
there<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> said<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.090> panning<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> not

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
there but as I said the panning is not

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
there but as I said the panning is not
possible<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.399> move<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.820> Jeep<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
possible when you move a Jeep to the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.429 
possible when you move a Jeep to the
left<00:01:52.340> or<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.810> only<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
left or to the right you can only do it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
left or to the right you can only do it
with<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> additional<00:01:56.009> head<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.670> think

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
with the additional head and I think

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.870 
with the additional head and I think
this<00:01:57.420> sort<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> setup<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.310> perfect<00:01:59.790> for

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this sort of setup is just perfect for

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.270 
this sort of setup is just perfect for
us<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.450> used<00:02:01.189> maybe<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.520> music<00:02:02.880> videos<00:02:03.270> or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
us to be used maybe for music videos or

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
us to be used maybe for music videos or
shooting<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.759> product<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:06.869> something<00:02:07.049> like

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
shooting a product or something like

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.570 
shooting a product or something like
that<00:02:07.290> where<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.550> wanna

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
that where you just wanna

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.610 
that where you just wanna
bunch<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.420> camera<00:02:10.780> goes<00:02:11.080> around<00:02:11.440> your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
bunch of a camera goes around your

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.980 
bunch of a camera goes around your
subject<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.180> great<00:02:13.420> using<00:02:13.900> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
subject I think it's just great using it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.290 
subject I think it's just great using it
like<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.320> at<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.220> back<00:02:15.370> there<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> lot<00:02:15.970> for

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
like that at the back there is a lot for

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.980 
like that at the back there is a lot for
the<00:02:16.720> weight<00:02:16.900> which<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.590> be<00:02:17.770> moved<00:02:18.040> forward<00:02:18.990> if

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
the weight which can be moved forward if

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.500 
the weight which can be moved forward if
you<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> lighter<00:02:20.830> camera<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> back<00:02:21.760> if

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you have a lighter camera and back if

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
you have a lighter camera and back if
you<00:02:22.630> haven't<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> camera<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> don't

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you haven't have a camera so you don't

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.100 
you haven't have a camera so you don't
need<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.190> use<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.670> many<00:02:24.880> weights<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.690> each<00:02:25.900> side

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
need to use as many weights on each side

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
need to use as many weights on each side
of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> rods<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:27.100> two<00:02:27.250> wheels<00:02:27.490> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of the rods there are two wheels that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.540 
of the rods there are two wheels that
keeps<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.490> gym<00:02:30.490> weights<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.970> place<00:02:32.550> basically

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
keeps the gym weights in place basically

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.250 
keeps the gym weights in place basically
just<00:02:33.730> tie<00:02:34.450> them<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
just tie them like that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.070 
just tie them like that
and<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.100> second<00:02:36.460> one<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.600> there<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.870> no

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
and the second one is and there is no

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560 
and the second one is and there is no
way<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:39.130> gym<00:02:39.340> weights<00:02:39.550> won't<00:02:39.790> move<00:02:39.970> around<00:02:40.120> or

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
way the gym weights won't move around or

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.870 
way the gym weights won't move around or
creating<00:02:40.960> noise<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.980> last<00:02:42.220> year<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> left

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
creating noise and last year on the left

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.700 
creating noise and last year on the left
side<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.270> Jeep<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.630> have<00:02:43.990> eight<00:02:44.260> months<00:02:44.500> a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
side of the Jeep I have eight months a

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.880 
side of the Jeep I have eight months a
platform<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:46.000> monitor<00:02:46.540> here<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.110> mine<00:02:47.380> but

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
platform the monitor here is mine but

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.340 
platform the monitor here is mine but
the<00:02:48.070> platform<00:02:48.280> comes<00:02:48.730> with<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> Jeep<00:02:49.420> and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the platform comes with the Jeep and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.020 
the platform comes with the Jeep and
what<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.800> about<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.220> particular<00:02:51.400> design

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
what I like about this particular design

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.410 
what I like about this particular design
is<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.830> monitor<00:02:54.280> always<00:02:54.730> stays<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.000> me

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
is that the monitor always stays with me

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.710 
is that the monitor always stays with me
as<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.660> move<00:02:55.959> around<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:59.250> can<00:03:00.250> always<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:01.030> what

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
as I move around I can always see what

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.600 
as I move around I can always see what
I'm<00:03:01.870> doing<00:03:02.230> either<00:03:02.650> moving<00:03:03.040> around

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.170 

unlike<00:03:07.080> some<00:03:08.080> moisture<00:03:08.740> solutions<00:03:09.220> where

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
unlike some moisture solutions where

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.620 
unlike some moisture solutions where
when<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> have<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.260> monitor<00:03:11.590> clamped<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
when you have a monitor clamped to the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.030 
when you have a monitor clamped to the
tripod<00:03:13.989> or<00:03:14.470> something<00:03:14.739> like<00:03:14.800> that

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
tripod or something like that

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.780 
tripod or something like that
and<00:03:16.230> let's<00:03:17.230> say<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.410> had<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.620> monitor<00:03:18.100> right<00:03:18.130> here

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
and let's say I had a monitor right here

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.540 
and let's say I had a monitor right here
and<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.900> started<00:03:20.230> moving<00:03:20.350> away<00:03:20.680> from<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.100> Teleco

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
and I started moving away from a Teleco

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.910 
and I started moving away from a Teleco
to<00:03:21.610> see<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.090> I'm<00:03:22.180> doing<00:03:22.510> with<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.410> platform

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
to see what I'm doing with this platform

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.120 
to see what I'm doing with this platform
I<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:25.060> always<00:03:25.360> see<00:03:25.780> what<00:03:26.019> I'm<00:03:26.140> doing<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.950> I'm

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
I can always see what I'm doing if I'm

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.270 
I can always see what I'm doing if I'm
operating<00:03:27.400> from<00:03:27.970> here<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.590> let<00:03:29.739> me<00:03:29.769> now<00:03:30.010> show

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
operating from here so let me now show

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.009 
operating from here so let me now show
you<00:03:30.340> what<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.670> blue<00:03:30.820> handle<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.420> for<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.840> don't

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
you what the blue handle is for I don't

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.660 
you what the blue handle is for I don't
really<00:03:32.140> use<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.500> feature<00:03:32.739> because<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.370> like

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
really use this feature because I like

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
really use this feature because I like
to<00:03:34.060> use<00:03:34.810> my<00:03:35.230> head<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.040> front<00:03:36.310> for<00:03:36.610> children

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to use my head on the front for children

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.170 
to use my head on the front for children
but<00:03:38.290> I'll<00:03:38.590> show<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.920> anyway<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.489> case<00:03:39.730> you

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
but I'll show you anyway in case you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.500 
but I'll show you anyway in case you
wondering<00:03:40.570> how<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.840> works

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.440 

have<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> look<00:03:46.349> at<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> front<00:03:46.709> platform<00:03:46.950> now

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
have a look at the front platform now

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.920 
have a look at the front platform now
you<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.660> move<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.050> around<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:50.930> with

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you can move it around like this with

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.870 
you can move it around like this with
this<00:03:52.110> new<00:03:52.319> handle<00:03:52.770> so<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.520> start<00:03:53.700> with

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
this new handle so I can start with

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.080 
this new handle so I can start with
camera<00:03:54.180> pointing<00:03:54.599> up<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.050> as<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.290> go<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:56.090> can

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
camera pointing up and as I go up I can

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.170 
camera pointing up and as I go up I can
chill<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.450> camera<00:03:57.780> down<00:03:58.099> and<00:03:59.099> all<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.790> kind

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
chill the camera down and all that kind

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.890 
chill the camera down and all that kind
of<00:04:00.239> stuff<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:01.500> do<00:04:01.680> with<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.420> handle<00:04:03.420> so

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
of stuff I can do with this handle so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.170 
of stuff I can do with this handle so
while<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.170> prefer<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.890> use<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.370> hat<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> front

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
while I prefer to use a hat on the front

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.880 
while I prefer to use a hat on the front
it's<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.480> always<00:04:06.780> possible<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.440> use<00:04:07.739> it

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
it's not always possible to use it

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.590 
it's not always possible to use it
especially<00:04:08.010> when<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:09.090> really<00:04:09.420> high

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
especially when you have a really high

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.170 
especially when you have a really high
shot<00:04:09.959> where<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.739> can't<00:04:11.069> physically<00:04:11.640> reach<00:04:11.940> it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
shot where you can't physically reach it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.330 
shot where you can't physically reach it
and<00:04:12.360> also<00:04:13.319> when<00:04:13.470> you're<00:04:13.590> operating<00:04:13.830> from<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
and also when you're operating from the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.849 
and also when you're operating from the
monitor<00:04:14.849> it's<00:04:15.720> much<00:04:15.989> easier<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:18.030> do<00:04:18.180> that

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
monitor it's much easier just to do that

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.620 
monitor it's much easier just to do that
as<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.010> can<00:04:20.130> probably<00:04:20.250> see<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.700> spreader<00:04:21.540> on

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
as you can probably see the spreader on

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.570 
as you can probably see the spreader on
the<00:04:21.810> bottom<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.169> fully<00:04:22.530> spread<00:04:22.860> out<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.430> give

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the bottom is fully spread out to give

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.090 
the bottom is fully spread out to give
me<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.760> best<00:04:23.940> stability<00:04:24.690> possible<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.380> even

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
me the best stability possible and even

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.060 
me the best stability possible and even
then<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.729> can<00:04:27.240> get<00:04:27.419> quite<00:04:27.720> decent<00:04:28.110> files<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.740> if

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
then I can get quite decent files and if

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.790 
then I can get quite decent files and if
you<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.790> nice<00:04:30.479> wide<00:04:30.810> angle<00:04:30.840> lens<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.650> can

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
you have a nice wide angle lens you can

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.560 
you have a nice wide angle lens you can
get<00:04:32.010> some<00:04:32.250> very<00:04:32.280> dramatic<00:04:32.639> movement<00:04:33.389> right

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
get some very dramatic movement right

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.409 
get some very dramatic movement right
there<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:35.010> let<00:04:35.430> me<00:04:35.850> now<00:04:36.060> put<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:38.550> legs<00:04:38.790> back

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
there but let me now put the legs back

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.810 
there but let me now put the legs back
in<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.970> show<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.030> what<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> highest<00:04:43.820> it

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
in and show you what is the highest it

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.530 
in and show you what is the highest it
can<00:04:44.880> go<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:47.400> while<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.760> might<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.180> as

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
can go so while this might not be as

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.990 
can go so while this might not be as
stable<00:04:48.750> as<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.350> set<00:04:49.560> up<00:04:49.650> before<00:04:50.070> I'm<00:04:50.460> getting

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
stable as the set up before I'm getting

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.320 
stable as the set up before I'm getting
even<00:04:51.419> more<00:04:51.450> height<00:04:51.840> now<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:53.520> really<00:04:54.120> nice

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
even more height now and a really nice

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.260 
even more height now and a really nice
good<00:04:54.720> range<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:56.310> will<00:04:56.430> create<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:56.820> range<00:04:57.090> of

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
good range that will create a range of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.909 
good range that will create a range of
match<00:04:57.390> shot<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.960> don't<00:04:58.140> know<00:04:58.200> if<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.440> can<00:04:58.590> see

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
match shot I don't know if you can see

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.460 
match shot I don't know if you can see
the<00:04:59.280> top<00:04:59.490> part<00:04:59.729> cuz<00:05:00.419> I'm<00:05:00.539> filming<00:05:00.840> myself<00:05:00.990> I

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
the top part cuz I'm filming myself I

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.880 
the top part cuz I'm filming myself I
don't<00:05:02.100> know<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:02.400> it's<00:05:02.550> got<00:05:02.700> soften<00:05:03.150> out<00:05:03.300> but

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
don't know if it's got soften out but

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.529 
don't know if it's got soften out but
this<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:04.950> really<00:05:05.280> fine<00:05:05.550> now<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:08.210> this<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.360> how

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
this is really fine now and this is how

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.060 
this is really fine now and this is how
I<00:05:09.570> use<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.930> sometimes<00:05:11.660> but<00:05:12.660> other<00:05:12.870> times<00:05:13.169> you

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
I use it sometimes but other times you

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.460 
I use it sometimes but other times you
can<00:05:14.220> just<00:05:14.430> spread<00:05:14.669> out<00:05:14.729> legs<00:05:15.229> like<00:05:16.229> that

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
can just spread out legs like that

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.160 
can just spread out legs like that
very<00:05:19.070> easily<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:20.420> still<00:05:20.660> have<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.900> nice

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
very easily and you still have a nice

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.210 
very easily and you still have a nice
range<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:22.730> can<00:05:22.790> just<00:05:23.300> about<00:05:23.630> reach<00:05:24.220> there

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
range and you can just about reach there

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.300 
range and you can just about reach there
and<00:05:26.030> then<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.020> go<00:05:27.170> down<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.710> can<00:05:28.010> do

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
and then as you go down you can do

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.730 
and then as you go down you can do
anything<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.000> want<00:05:29.180> with<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.410> this<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.620> a

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
anything you want with it this is a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.820 
anything you want with it this is a
cheap<00:05:31.040> one<00:05:31.450> product<00:05:32.450> has<00:05:32.630> doubled<00:05:33.320> long<00:05:33.560> time

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
cheap one product has doubled long time

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.920 
cheap one product has doubled long time
ago<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:34.820> for<00:05:35.060> something<00:05:35.240> like<00:05:35.420> this<00:05:35.510> works

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
ago and for something like this works

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.610 
ago and for something like this works
just<00:05:36.110> fine

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
just fine

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.620 
just fine
regarding<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.370> cameras<00:05:37.850> you<00:05:37.880> can<00:05:38.060> use<00:05:38.360> with

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
regarding the cameras you can use with

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.510 
regarding the cameras you can use with
this<00:05:38.810> chip<00:05:39.110> I'm<00:05:39.350> not<00:05:39.590> quite<00:05:39.920> sure<00:05:39.950> what's<00:05:40.400> the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
this chip I'm not quite sure what's the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.940 
this chip I'm not quite sure what's the
limit<00:05:40.850> but<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.180> structure<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:42.050> very<00:05:42.440> sturdy

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
limit but the structure is very sturdy

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.620 
limit but the structure is very sturdy
and<00:05:43.130> I<00:05:43.310> think<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.670> can<00:05:43.850> take<00:05:44.120> quite<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.360> bit<00:05:44.510> of

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
and I think it can take quite a bit of

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.740 
and I think it can take quite a bit of
weight<00:05:44.810> on<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.650> front<00:05:46.570> provided<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.630> you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
weight on the front provided that you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.480 
weight on the front provided that you
have<00:05:48.020> enough<00:05:48.500> weight<00:05:48.740> at<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.040> back<00:05:49.220> to

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
have enough weight at the back to

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.430 
have enough weight at the back to
balance<00:05:49.670> it<00:05:49.940> out<00:05:50.030> I've<00:05:50.450> used<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:50.900> kind<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.320> a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
balance it out I've used the kind of a

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.500 
balance it out I've used the kind of a
view<00:05:51.500> mark<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.010> with<00:05:52.310> this<00:05:52.550> chip<00:05:52.820> but<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
view mark to with this chip but the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.600 
view mark to with this chip but the
camera<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:53.960> really<00:05:54.230> prefer<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.740> use<00:05:55.040> with<00:05:55.580> a

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
camera I really prefer to use with a

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.110 
camera I really prefer to use with a
jeep<00:05:55.970> is<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.960> little<00:05:57.320> sony<00:05:57.620> 5n<00:05:58.190> which<00:05:58.550> magically

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
jeep is a little sony 5n which magically

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.080 
jeep is a little sony 5n which magically
appeared<00:05:59.510> in<00:05:59.600> my<00:05:59.780> hands<00:06:00.080> right<00:06:00.230> now<00:06:01.090> the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
appeared in my hands right now the

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.140 
appeared in my hands right now the
reason<00:06:02.390> why<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.870> choose<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:04.310> camera<00:06:04.760> over

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
reason why I choose this camera over

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.200 
reason why I choose this camera over
let's<00:06:05.540> say<00:06:05.720> a<00:06:05.930> canon<00:06:06.260> 5d<00:06:06.440> is<00:06:06.770> because<00:06:07.310> this

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
let's say a canon 5d is because this

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.180 
let's say a canon 5d is because this
camera<00:06:08.540> has<00:06:08.660> auto<00:06:08.930> focusing<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:09.680> think<00:06:09.950> our

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
camera has auto focusing and I think our

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.180 
camera has auto focusing and I think our
focusing<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:10.910> very<00:06:11.120> important<00:06:11.600> for<00:06:12.590> use<00:06:12.770> with

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
focusing is very important for use with

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.260 
focusing is very important for use with
a<00:06:13.370> chip<00:06:13.580> because<00:06:14.330> when<00:06:15.320> you<00:06:15.620> are<00:06:16.270> controlling

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
a chip because when you are controlling

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.580 
a chip because when you are controlling
the<00:06:17.330> camera<00:06:17.510> especially<00:06:17.870> from<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.440> back

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
the camera especially from the back

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.570 
the camera especially from the back
right<00:06:18.920> here<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.730> can't<00:06:19.940> focus<00:06:20.150> with<00:06:20.450> it<00:06:20.630> and

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
right here you can't focus with it and

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.120 
right here you can't focus with it and
sometimes<00:06:22.580> you<00:06:23.030> start<00:06:23.360> from<00:06:24.230> a<00:06:24.350> subject<00:06:24.890> that

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
sometimes you start from a subject that

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.040 
sometimes you start from a subject that
is<00:06:25.730> near<00:06:25.940> to<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.210> camera<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:26.600> then<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.750> move

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050

is near to the camera and then you move
away<00:06:27.169> from<00:06:27.290> it<00:06:27.650> or<00:06:27.950> you<00:06:28.550> come<00:06:28.760> into<00:06:28.940> it<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.390> if

away from it or you come into it and if

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
you don't have any other focus on your

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.450 
you don't have any other focus on your
camera<00:06:32.180> you're<00:06:32.630> just<00:06:32.840> not<00:06:33.050> gonna<00:06:33.380> get<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.980> good

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
camera you're just not gonna get a good

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.240 
camera you're just not gonna get a good
shot<00:06:34.700> because<00:06:34.910> either<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:36.169> close<00:06:36.770> shot<00:06:36.890> will

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
shot because either the close shot will

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.659 
shot because either the close shot will
be<00:06:37.280> out<00:06:37.610> of<00:06:37.640> focus<00:06:37.910> or<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:39.040> further<00:06:40.040> away<00:06:40.250> why

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
be out of focus or the further away why

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.159 
be out of focus or the further away why
the<00:06:40.730> shot<00:06:41.090> will<00:06:41.300> be<00:06:41.419> out<00:06:41.510> of<00:06:41.540> focus<00:06:41.750> is<00:06:42.020> just

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
the shot will be out of focus is just

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.860 
the shot will be out of focus is just
not<00:06:42.380> gonna<00:06:42.500> work<00:06:42.770> well<00:06:43.070> another<00:06:44.000> reason<00:06:44.390> why<00:06:44.540> I

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
not gonna work well another reason why I

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.580 
not gonna work well another reason why I
like<00:06:45.260> to<00:06:45.290> use<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.890> little<00:06:46.430> camera<00:06:46.730> like<00:06:46.910> that<00:06:46.940> is

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
like to use a little camera like that is

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.230 
like to use a little camera like that is
because<00:06:48.590> I<00:06:48.800> need<00:06:48.950> less<00:06:49.340> weight<00:06:49.700> at<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.030> back

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
because I need less weight at the back

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.620 
because I need less weight at the back
and<00:06:50.540> I<00:06:51.440> can<00:06:51.620> then<00:06:51.860> just<00:06:52.430> move<00:06:53.240> around<00:06:53.360> the

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
and I can then just move around the

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.280 
and I can then just move around the
whole<00:06:53.840> Jeep<00:06:54.140> much<00:06:54.500> easier<00:06:55.750> so<00:06:56.750> this<00:06:56.930> sort<00:06:57.200> of

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
whole Jeep much easier so this sort of

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.760 
whole Jeep much easier so this sort of
