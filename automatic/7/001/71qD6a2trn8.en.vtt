alright this video shows the the
building<00:00:10.880> of<00:00:11.090> a<00:00:11.629> masonite<00:00:12.580> template<00:00:13.580> that

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
building of a masonite template that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.459 
building of a masonite template that
matches<00:00:13.850> the<00:00:14.450> phone<00:00:14.660> templates<00:00:15.170> that<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:15.350> came

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
matches the phone templates that I came

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.370 
matches the phone templates that I came
up<00:00:15.650> with<00:00:16.039> for<00:00:16.340> my<00:00:16.520> engine<00:00:16.880> cradle<00:00:17.119> I<00:00:17.420> basically

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
up with for my engine cradle I basically

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.310 
up with for my engine cradle I basically
cut<00:00:18.619> a<00:00:18.830> piece<00:00:19.220> of<00:00:19.279> masonite<00:00:19.970> out<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.510> wrap<00:00:21.110> the

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
cut a piece of masonite out and wrap the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.260 
cut a piece of masonite out and wrap the
edges<00:00:21.590> with<00:00:21.619> foil<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.430> I<00:00:22.550> can<00:00:22.640> clamp<00:00:23.090> that

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
edges with foil so that I can clamp that

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.420 
edges with foil so that I can clamp that
to<00:00:23.480> my<00:00:23.720> piece<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.140> steel<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.470> use<00:00:24.890> my<00:00:25.100> plasma

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
to my piece of steel and use my plasma

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.990 
to my piece of steel and use my plasma
cutter<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:26.600> cut<00:00:26.630> through<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.500> steel<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:28.160> just

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
cutter to cut through the steel and just

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.720 
cutter to cut through the steel and just
make<00:00:29.210> sure<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.420> both<00:00:29.840> pieces<00:00:30.830> get<00:00:31.460> cut

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
make sure that both pieces get cut

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.529 
make sure that both pieces get cut
correctly<00:00:32.890> what<00:00:33.890> I've<00:00:34.010> done<00:00:34.190> since<00:00:34.550> last<00:00:35.270> time

down on the line this plate will give me

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.669 
down on the line this plate will give me
the<00:01:29.119> ability<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:30.549> cut<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:32.109> steel<00:01:33.109> out<00:01:33.319> in<00:01:33.529> the

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
the ability to cut this steel out in the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.969 
the ability to cut this steel out in the
exact<00:01:33.950> same<00:01:34.159> shape<00:01:34.219> as<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:36.619> can<00:01:36.799> see

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
exact same shape as this you can see

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.539 
exact same shape as this you can see
that<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.369> wrap<00:01:38.029> the<00:01:38.299> edges<00:01:38.659> with<00:01:38.920> foil<00:01:39.920> kind<00:01:40.459> of

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that I wrap the edges with foil kind of

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.589 
that I wrap the edges with foil kind of
foil<00:01:41.509> tape<00:01:42.009> just<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.159> try<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.429> keep<00:01:43.670> from

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
foil tape just to try to keep from

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:49.730 
foil tape just to try to keep from
burning<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.170> board<00:01:46.719> see<00:01:47.719> here's<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.020> phone

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
burning the board see here's the phone

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.560 
burning the board see here's the phone
that<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> car<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.270> face

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that was that was on the car the face

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.319 
that was that was on the car the face
that<00:01:54.750> goes<00:01:54.930> through<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> rear<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> car

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
that goes through the rear of the car

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:06.649 
that goes through the rear of the car
goes<00:01:57.329> through<00:01:57.920> here<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.420> there

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
goes through here and it's right there

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749 
goes through here and it's right there
so<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.080> will<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.710> bolt<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> rail

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so this will actually bolt to this rail

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
so this will actually bolt to this rail
right<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.630> will<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.080> quarter<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
right here and it will be a quarter a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.990 
right here and it will be a quarter a
stick<00:02:10.890> plate<00:02:11.130> which<00:02:11.370> will<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.550> backed<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.910> with

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
stick plate which will be backed up with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.360 
stick plate which will be backed up with
another<00:02:12.300> plate<00:02:12.630> come<00:02:13.410> across<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> front<00:02:14.160> I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
another plate come across the front I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.100 
another plate come across the front I
would<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.450> quarter-inch<00:02:15.900> plate

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
would like to get the quarter-inch plate

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.300 
would like to get the quarter-inch plate
in<00:02:16.290> first<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.310> order<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:18.260> ensure<00:02:19.260> that

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
in first in order to ensure that

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.150 
in first in order to ensure that
everything<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.519> lined<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:20.970> correctly<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:22.160> also

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
everything is lined up correctly I also

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.680 
everything is lined up correctly I also
built<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.900> angle<00:02:25.500> gauge<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:27.209> sit<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.630> on

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
built this angle gauge you sit here on

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.740 
built this angle gauge you sit here on
the<00:02:27.840> angle<00:02:28.489> as<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.330> gives<00:02:30.690> me

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
the angle as you can see this gives me

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.009 
the angle as you can see this gives me
the<00:02:30.840> angle<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.980> Bend<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.569> take<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
the angle of this Bend when I take it to

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.530 
the angle of this Bend when I take it to
the<00:02:34.110> shop<00:02:34.760> they'll<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.819> able<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.269> able<00:02:36.360> to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930 
the shop they'll be able to be able to
bend<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.840> metal<00:02:37.650> set<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
bend that metal set this down on the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.890 
bend that metal set this down on the
metal<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:40.220> check<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.000> make<00:02:42.299> sure<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.720> the

metal and check and make sure that the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.110 
metal and check and make sure that the
bend<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.880> angle<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.970> going

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bend is just the right angle I'm going

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
bend is just the right angle I'm going
to<00:02:48.180> cut<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.510> steel<00:02:49.049> plates<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:50.250> match

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
to cut out the steel plates to match

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.019 
to cut out the steel plates to match
that<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.480> wooden<00:02:51.810> plate
