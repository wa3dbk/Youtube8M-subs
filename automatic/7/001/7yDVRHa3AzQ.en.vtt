first<00:00:00.840> off<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.410> could<00:00:01.709> come<00:00:02.070> in<00:00:02.370> right<00:00:03.090> here

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
first off we could come in right here

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.539 
first off we could come in right here
between<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.049> last<00:00:04.230> two<00:00:04.350> lumbar<00:00:04.680> vertebrae

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
between the last two lumbar vertebrae

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.650 
between the last two lumbar vertebrae
and<00:00:06.049> cut<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.410> into<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.980> short<00:00:08.639> loin<00:00:08.940> section

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and cut this into a short loin section

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.850 
and cut this into a short loin section
in<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.410> sirloin<00:00:11.059> section<00:00:12.290> we<00:00:13.290> could<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
in a sirloin section we could do that

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.359 
in a sirloin section we could do that
and<00:00:14.250> then<00:00:14.370> use<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.059> short<00:00:15.870> loin<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.680> you'll

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and then use this short loin as you'll

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.099 
and then use this short loin as you'll
see<00:00:17.460> later<00:00:17.640> cut<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:19.279> porterhouse<00:00:20.279> steaks

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.500 
see later cut into porterhouse steaks
t-bone<00:00:22.109> steaks<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.070> finally<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> front

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
t-bone steaks and finally off the front

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
t-bone steaks and finally off the front
we<00:00:24.660> may<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> strip<00:00:25.560> steak<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:26.099> two<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
we may get a strip steak or two as the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349 
we may get a strip steak or two as the
terrace<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.170> tenderloin<00:00:29.000> begins<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
terrace that the tenderloin begins to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.889 
terrace that the tenderloin begins to
narrow<00:00:30.900> down<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.619> its<00:00:32.070> attachment<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.750> we

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
narrow down to its attachment so we

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
narrow down to its attachment so we
could<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.739> today<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.360> we're<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
could do that today what we're about to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
could do that today what we're about to
do<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> come<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> take

do is we're going to come in and take
the<00:00:38.760> whole<00:00:39.120> tenderloin<00:00:41.270> first<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:43.530> whole

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the whole tenderloin first as one whole

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.520

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and three quarters percent from the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
and three quarters percent from the
carcass<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.920> small<00:00:50.039> piece<00:00:50.610> but

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
not the short loin that we'd use for

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
not the short loin that we'd use for
porterhouses<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.759> t-bones<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> actual

side<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.050> make<00:04:41.650> these<00:04:41.980> more<00:04:42.220> tender<00:04:42.730> one<00:04:43.000> of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
side so to make these more tender one of

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.050 
side so to make these more tender one of
the<00:04:43.210> things<00:04:43.510> that's<00:04:43.780> that's<00:04:44.500> done<00:04:44.920> is<00:04:45.220> to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
the things that's that's done is to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.600 
the things that's that's done is to
remove<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:47.170> cap<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.610> biceps<00:04:49.180> femoris<00:04:49.540> muscle

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
remove the cap the biceps femoris muscle

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.780 
remove the cap the biceps femoris muscle
if<00:04:51.610> we<00:04:52.120> use<00:04:52.390> it<00:04:52.660> now<00:04:52.960> we<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.830> cut<00:04:54.010> across<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
if we use it now we can cut across the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.160 
if we use it now we can cut across the
grain<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:56.260> make<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.710> more<00:04:56.920> tender<00:04:57.780> by<00:04:58.780> doing

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
grain to make it more tender by doing

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.150 
grain to make it more tender by doing
that<00:04:59.200> also<00:04:59.530> we<00:05:00.040> isolate<00:05:01.170> one<00:05:02.170> major<00:05:02.500> muscle

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
that also we isolate one major muscle

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.260 
that also we isolate one major muscle
the<00:05:03.280> gluteus<00:05:03.700> medius<00:05:03.930> by<00:05:04.930> also<00:05:05.350> removing<00:05:06.270> some

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
the gluteus medius by also removing some

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.900 
the gluteus medius by also removing some
accessory<00:05:07.930> muscles<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.010> now<00:05:09.220> we<00:05:09.280> can<00:05:09.640> cut

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
accessory muscles and so now we can cut

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.370 
accessory muscles and so now we can cut
steaks<00:05:10.560> across<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:12.520> way<00:05:12.790> we<00:05:13.660> can<00:05:13.690> separate

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
steaks across this way we can separate

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.250 
steaks across this way we can separate
it<00:05:14.410> into<00:05:14.650> portions<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.640> cut<00:05:16.420> thicker<00:05:16.780> steaks

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
it into portions and cut thicker steaks

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.280 
it into portions and cut thicker steaks
according<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.220> portion<00:05:18.760> size<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:19.870> we're<00:05:20.020> down

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
according to portion size but we're down

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.330 
according to portion size but we're down
to<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:20.980> single<00:05:21.700> muscle<00:05:22.450> that<00:05:23.290> can<00:05:23.590> be<00:05:23.770> utilized

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
to a single muscle that can be utilized

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.860 
to a single muscle that can be utilized
for<00:05:24.670> high-quality<00:05:25.630> sirloin<00:05:26.530> steaks
