00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.000
 Natalya Vitrenko do not buy anything from 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'm not talking about a big car 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.730
 the city will take with us at least cool 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.900
 grandfather 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.359
 most of the owners of these 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.529
 cars can not either for some 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.330
 reasons do not want to reveal the potential 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.409
 cars 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.109
 but the atmosphere to feel 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.469
 owning a corner class 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440
 give up habit or health 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 remains of cells from tomsk importance 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.780
 which mini buggy barking owners 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.159
 domestic car industry 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.460
 advise pliz right and exam 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.550
 if they told me that I would be today 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 I test the English car 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.139
 would believe 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.309
 if you said it would present 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.809
 details of the Andean or Spanish car industry 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.989
 I too hardly doubted, but if 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.080
 me on her visa 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.010
 the kids said we eat japanese i would 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.100
 laughed exactly 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 I could not imagine that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.390
 Eastern car may be so 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.690
 really and his really 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.560
 created ipo 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.310
 I'm not specifically naming the brand 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.820
 cars for you to try 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.400
 I realized that there is no such combat 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.500
 such a young man 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.790
 ford mondeo 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.370
 no i can't i give it away i'm doing patkar 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 This is Japan, more precisely, even there is no peronko 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.490
 to send the right to the right to this 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.040
 flight on the ship but not so data which 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.250
 sick of all lovers of sudan 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.770
 new building kills ghana which is between 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.580
 Others very recently in the market have become 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.710
 not too classic 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 changed and after restyling 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 here outside you can say it and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.630
 Japanese are characterized by the headlights 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.079
 mine is beautiful though again on 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.770
 amateur 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.140
 fulham 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.729
 I know people who buy such cars 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.890
 gathers his friends and walks in circles 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.429
 around your new acquisition 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.749
 usually when clicking the seeds and 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.329
 carefully inspecting krill 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.040
 cars 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.200
 difference from your neighbor who is not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.630
 arrived owner is obliged to put in 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.770
 pocket so that's what the key chain is about 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.299
 alarms 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.170
 such an attitude cumbria 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.889
 she does not understand lively 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.689
 it's a pity to leave her outside in the cold 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.119
 but they don't even want to leave in the rain 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.019
 because such beauty 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.769
 almost like something off the hand 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.510
 today i'm not in the mood 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.090
 telling how a go controls this 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.359
 some other castorama machines 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.639
 my task is to evaluate the car from the point 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.679
 passenger view 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:48.909
 where is the driver 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.799
 I already want to go 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.309
 at the petrol owners 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.229
 dorestaylingov camre asked me 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.180
 how much did I have to install 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.990
 in the grille and mirrors with 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.209
 repeaters 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.339
 really kind and small changes 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.969
 in appearance immediately stand out but 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.769
 new camry but as for owners 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.249
 the same 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.079
 until I ride the updated toyota and I 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.759
 also did not distinguish it from its predecessor, but 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.769
 but now the previous model 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.319
 look like a relic now 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.469
 a few words about the changes that 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.519
 touched gas to be honest 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.480
 row on the exterior I hardly unlike 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.939
 models from previous owners though 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.590
 it is two times and not paying attention to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.400
 new front bumper with modified 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.699
 foglights are especially attentive 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.239
 look also at the grille 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.329
 but there is one detail that immediately 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.999
 responsible restyling is repeaters 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.139
 turn signals side mirrors 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.339
 why I initially could not believe it and 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.799
 Japanese noise in the cabin makes 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.699
 think earlier in Omsk origin 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.279
 Of course for the German car industry this car 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:53.810
 if not far away 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.120
 but still not close but the feeling is that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.470
 updated camre done by others 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.230
 by people 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.719
 who before the opposition go 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.169
 seal all the gaps in the design they 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.299
 shut up their carcasses as many do 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.049
 business class sedan with these words 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.339
 not a passionate person 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.319
 cars first on the first drawn 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 image of Mercedes 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.159
 but sport is celebrated annually and is capable 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.309
 from the first time to drive the country correctly to 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:22.920
 refueling by any car 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.760
 under before hurried 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.150
 give wrong thoughts for 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.710
 several valid results 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.169
 think again 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.479
 I now associate business class 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.560
 with several machines including 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.729
 country 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.400
 opinion that in machines of this segment it is possible 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.249
 convenient to fall apart in the back row and 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.860
 set on the armrest of coffee 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.330
 car confirms toyota 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.800
 but again an article with a small exception 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.319
 say that in the car, I just start straight 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.539
 very comfortable i can't though the sphere will 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.220
 sit on the edge of a dwarf 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.990
 and he will be on duty in the trunk of the train if 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.980
 can fit in boston fatigue 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.090
 Absolutely calmly I will pass a few 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.280
 hundreds of miles behind the wheel in this car 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.080
 I want to travel long distances 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.220
 if you are a travel fan and often 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.220
 Regards abroad here is this car machine 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.020
 for central Russia if you are neither 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.759
 officials no businessman i wouldn't 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.270
 advised the buyer suspension elasticity is not 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.459
 allows you to fall into the pit every 

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:20.960
 few meters 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.000
 toyota camry dream avid hay assets and 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.990
 scary dream jeep ristov 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.340
 if you transfer to such a machine let's say 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.639
 from ford mondeo or mitzubishi galant then naturally 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.469
 going out of it you will dance 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.169
 and sitting in the car do not care 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.199
 latin ditties 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.650
 if you used to be called astahovu or 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.710
 cadillac escalade not notice curbs then sitting down 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.279
 toyota you will feel 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.470
 disadvantaged 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.910
 there is even a chance that you will develop 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.530
 claustrophobia I would refer meanwhile 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.050
 American version 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.270
 this car must surely have some 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.190
 some tons of Pushkin chose the reno bulls he 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.270
 Korea preferred kulakovskaya 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.520
 margaritas probably went milk 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.580
 Mariana would have flown I was no longer 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.000
 I'm talking about Adam Kozlevich released 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.319
 would surely go with the tasty ones even if 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.650
 opinion of the driver is bad he would be a little bit 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.289
 lost if you want to ship in 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.550
 this car construction 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.930
 materials or complete 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.720
 wintering preparatory work 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.050
 the size of the trunk is enough except it 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.340
 prepares the product for a month and a half or 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.139
 buildings owl what but rub 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.460
 although in the trunk of this class probably 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.939
 need to carry something 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.089
 compact and compact for example road 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.830
 the funds so that we get a sedan 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.330
 business class from japanese 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.959
 manufacturer and in a white horse by 

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.750
 Japanese patterns and clearly 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.900
 quite nice to talk to 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.910
 functional relationship 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.150
 Well, the car is sold and will be 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.800
 people fell in love with camry I don't know 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.750
 why is it really to taste 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.750
 and color 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:09.479
 highlight
