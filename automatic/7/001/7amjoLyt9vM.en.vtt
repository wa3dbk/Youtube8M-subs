our fetch lands shock lands and slow

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.110 
our fetch lands shock lands and slow
lands<00:00:23.140> as<00:00:23.260> well<00:00:23.680> as<00:00:23.830> other<00:00:24.160> types<00:00:24.580> of<00:00:24.760> lands

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
that are going to come out in the future

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.740 
that are going to come out in the future
it<00:00:27.040> looks<00:00:27.220> like<00:00:27.340> they're<00:00:27.520> going<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.760> be<00:00:28.180> 25

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
it looks like they're going to be 25

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.050 
it looks like they're going to be 25
this<00:00:29.290> time<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.830> there's<00:00:30.010> going<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.310> be<00:00:30.340> 20<00:00:30.730> the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
this time and there's going to be 20 the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.810 
this time and there's going to be 20 the
next<00:00:31.300> time<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:32.410> psycho<00:00:32.829> seems<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.340> be<00:00:33.520> all

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
next time so this psycho seems to be all

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.750 
next time so this psycho seems to be all
the<00:00:34.089> fetch<00:00:34.300> lands<00:00:34.539> all<00:00:34.809> ten<00:00:35.530> fathoms<00:00:35.800> all<00:00:36.309> ten

now<00:00:41.339> when<00:00:42.339> i<00:00:42.370> first<00:00:42.760> read<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:42.969> i<00:00:43.149> was<00:00:43.300> like<00:00:43.329> ok

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
now when i first read it i was like ok

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.479 
now when i first read it i was like ok
they're<00:00:43.989> just<00:00:44.260> mythic<00:00:44.649> but<00:00:45.010> they're<00:00:45.190> not<00:00:45.309> just

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
they're just mythic but they're not just

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.809 
they're just mythic but they're not just
mythic<00:00:45.969> their<00:00:46.149> foil<00:00:46.629> mythic<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.819> chance

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
mythic their foil mythic so the chance

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.809 
mythic their foil mythic so the chance
of<00:00:49.059> getting<00:00:49.120> one<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.899> about<00:00:50.170> one<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:50.800> case<00:00:51.339> now

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
of getting one is about one a case now

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.049 
of getting one is about one a case now
that<00:00:52.059> means<00:00:52.269> i<00:00:52.569> have<00:00:52.979> various<00:00:53.979> i<00:00:54.219> would<00:00:54.909> go

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
that means i have various i would go

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.110 
that means i have various i would go
over<00:00:55.179> the<00:00:55.300> math<00:00:55.739> myself<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.949> how<00:00:56.979> many<00:00:57.429> packs<00:00:57.789> i

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
over the math myself of how many packs i

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.569 
over the math myself of how many packs i
will<00:00:58.329> i<00:00:58.629> should<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.499> able<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.829> open<00:00:59.979> one<00:01:00.309> on

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
will i should be able to open one on

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.419 
will i should be able to open one on
camera<00:01:01.510> assuming<00:01:02.199> i<00:01:02.350> open<00:01:02.679> all<00:01:02.800> my<00:01:02.949> packs<00:01:03.219> on

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
camera assuming i open all my packs on

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.209 
camera assuming i open all my packs on
camera<00:01:03.999> and<00:01:04.330> i'll<00:01:04.600> be<00:01:04.720> very<00:01:05.050> cool<00:01:05.379> now<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
camera and i'll be very cool now the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.020 
camera and i'll be very cool now the
price<00:01:06.640> point<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.240> going<00:01:07.719> to<00:01:07.840> very<00:01:08.770> very<00:01:09.130> be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
price point is going to very very be

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.209 
price point is going to very very be
dependent<00:01:10.570> on<00:01:10.659> how<00:01:11.110> often<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.740> card<00:01:11.950> sees

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
dependent on how often the card sees
