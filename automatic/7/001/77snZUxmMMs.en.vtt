00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 we are here third and last block 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.920
 Today's ufo phenomenon 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 I was commenting on 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 Brazilian spiritism of cases involving the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.480
 Incarnation did not flee also happens 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.939
 And forgetting to comment 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 I've seen several cases of this type is this 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.359
 ended up bringing me to another spirit and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.340
 that's just it 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.039
 I never imagined that in geological research 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.510
 come up with cases of reincarnation of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.740
 service that is being born here are not 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 They are not from here. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.760
 we see as the one messi said 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 it is absolutely true, it is not the father of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 alive and not of the dead 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.649
 always life and not death but that I 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.620
 I said that it is a case that occurred in 1905 and 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 1906 in Italy if there is another 100 years 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 and involves a the daughter of one of a military 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.770
 Italian at the time and her husband 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.289
 they had a girl bianca girl 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.619
 happy living brought much joy from the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.080
 couple but unfortunately the bianca after 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 a few years ago he became ill and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.630
 I ended up dying to spend about three years 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 more or less more than the death of this 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 of the girl bianca her mother was sleeping 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.909
 when she had a vision she saw her 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.299
 bianca daughter who had disincarnated themselves 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.790
 approach her and say the following looks 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.729
 Mommy, I'm coming back. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.600
 That's what she said to her mother and mother. 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.119
 woke up practically in shock 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.720
 because the certainty she had of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.119
 presence of the girl engages a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 episode unfolding when the presence 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.770
 so it's so real is not that the person 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.619
 wake up often believing that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.200
 see the person in front of you 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.100
 is a case of unfolding so the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 Sleeping mother we know that when the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 person sleeps a spirit wins a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 condition of greater freedom 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.960
 he can get away from the body to have 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.969
 a better view of what happens to your 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 back including entities 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.220
 She saw her daughter and her daughter did the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.890
 announcement that she is coming back when she 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.590
 reacquire consciousness 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.450
 the spirit once again loses that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.940
 capacity no longer has the facility 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.950
 evidence that he had a state of 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.480
 mother's sleep practically screaming state of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.200
 shock her husband even talked 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.380
 with her 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.810
 there is very materialistic and is to believe 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.300
 that this is a hallucination 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.160
 is that of a trauma that the woman kept 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.420
 kept inside 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.430
 but it is fact or not the truth that some 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.160
 months later she gave birth to a second 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.320
 girl who also received the name of 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.810
 bianca and what caught the couple's attention 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.550
 So were the similarities with the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.900
 same as this girl who was born 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.070
 She had with her older sister 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.709
 died 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.040
 the eyes were big like the hair 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.850
 it was curly and black the same 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.269
 the curious detail she learned to speak 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.700
 in a few months his sister died 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.100
 it was also the couple had other children 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.269
 none of them manifested such skill 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.880
 all took more than a year to avianca 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.250
 the first one who will die will start to speak 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.920
 at seven months this second girl who 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.500
 received the same name also in a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.660
 detail that deeply shocked the couple 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.590
 the first bianca met a girl 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.450
 french and this girls the coleguinha 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.880
 taught a lullaby and after that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.730
 The first bianca died. 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.709
 parents are tinted never right 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.829
 touched on this subject no more 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.579
 commenting on this song 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.880
 they had forgotten when talking in the 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.070
 room they heard the same song from 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.049
 in the same tone of voice 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.079
 the two got up from the room went to the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.500
 room and passed the immense surprise bianca 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.900
 second he sang that song with his voice 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.440
 equal to that of the sister who died and detail 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 She did not know her father's music. 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.280
 profoundly a materialistic person 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.709
 deeply shocked by that. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.840
 came to her and asked but my 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.169
 daughter where you learned this song 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.500
 she said naturally not father I 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.320
 I did not learn, I already knew the song already 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.740
 I know this song, I do not know how 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.940
 Why, but I already knew about this song. 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.419
 bianca expressed other right skills in 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.590
 knowledge of curiosity is 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.229
 of liveliness in studies equal to that of 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.300
 the sister she had lost as a 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.030
 explain all this but through a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.220
 case of very difficult reincarnation does not 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.889
 physical immunities but the case of the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.070
 music she had never heard 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.919
 sister who will die together and all this 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.150
 sister's return in unfolding with the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.479
 Mother telling you her return is very 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.740
 difficult to put this as something fictitious 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.750
 very difficult 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.150
 this is a very famous case a boy 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.810
 in the United States at the age of five 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.639
 his father is noticed that he had a 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.260
 fascination for very large airplanes 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.139
 he arrived to take him to a museum of 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.630
 aeronautics he stopped in front of 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.090
 a naval fighter World War II was 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.940
 deeply moved the father realized 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.830
 This is what you asked him because he 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.130
 I was thrilled he said it's too 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.169
 similar to the plane he will fly 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.450
 will be surprised that there was a boy 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.849
 five years could have piloted it 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.220
 wrote the type of motor running 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.099
 engine of her with five years and doing 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.510
 a hypnotic regression was discovered 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.789
 that he was a naval pilot on the second 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.770
 world war and your plane is over 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.250
 being thrown into flames by a case 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.620
 Japanese however that boy like 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.210
 reborn had no memory of the aircraft 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.080
 characteristics in common a large 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.639
 fear of fire that had been to memory 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.300
 of that previous life than that boy 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.099
 have so we will reincarnation is not 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.190
 real fiction 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.260
 many doctors today are discovering this 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.599
 the near-death experiences that 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.550
 occurs in hospitals in cases where 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.310
 involve reincarnation involving physicians 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.360
 psychologist every day more is known to 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.539
 I respect that 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.969
 pity that many still have a bias 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.130
 with respect to these matters and not bring 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.729
 a more serious study was what 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.800
 We had 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.689
 our program today's program I 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.009

 as we are always open to suggestions 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:52.199
 critical issues is not always 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.029
 important you will help us to improve 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.979
 more and more the program
