00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.230
 Hi, I'm Francisco Laredo, anesthesiologist 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.360
 veterinarian and I participated in the 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.640
 realization and design of a course of 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.400
 Inhalation anesthesia monitoring and 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.920
 mechanical ventilation online 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.369
 today the development of tools 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.680
 Self-study is very important 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.619
 within the new strategies 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.740
 teachers in the university and outside the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 university with this endeavor in with this 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.070
 belief we have prepared a series of 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.699
 virtual online presentations that 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.330
 also support the observation of 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.589
 commented videos where they stand out and 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.549
 pay attention to the aspects 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:49.430
 practical theoretical fundamentals for 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.500
 understand the bases of realization of 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 these techniques in the small clinic 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.430
 animals 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.320
 in this movie we watch a patient 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.170
 of 8 kilos of weight that is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.710
 connected to a circuit madrid or maples 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 are the gases are located 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.080
 fresh anesthetics at the end 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.050
 opposite the patient's mouth the bag 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.560
 reservoir and the expiratory valve is 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.120
 found near the patient's mouth 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 the movements are appreciated 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.380
 respiratory of the patient in the bag 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.930
 backup 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.229
 the anesthesia is being maintained with a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.020
 concentration of exo flora not of 17 and the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.720
 Fresh oxygen flow is found in 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.720
 one liter and a half of oxygen per minute 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.079
 the animal has an expired co2 of 59 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.300
 millimeters of mercury what denotes 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.960
 certain hypoventilation 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.180
 if the supply of anesthetic gas is closed 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.790
 cool to the circuit is going to be everything 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.790
 impossible point to eliminate the co2 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.000
 inspired by the patient in this 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.970
 graph you see the starting point of 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 inspiration that practically has a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.099
 value close to 0 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.409
 as soon as the gas supply is closed 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.220
 fresh anesthetic to this circuit without 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.220
 given case 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.240
 the line that represents the point of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.940
 start of inspiration is moving away 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.940
 more and more of the zero value 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.890
 and after four respiratory movements 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.640
 it is situated at a value close to 10 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 it is enough to recover the contribution of gas 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.959
 fresh anesthetic to the circuit 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.739
 so that the phenomenon of re 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.739
 inhalation 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.480
 this course will also be reinforced with 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.959
 task completion exercises 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.730
 forums to resolve doubts in order with 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.040
 a whole series of tools that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.530
 I hope they are very useful so that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.020
 improve jce day by day in the realization 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.150
 of your clinical anesthetics 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.690
 in the hope that this course is 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.690
 useful I say goodbye and I see you online
