00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.280
 to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.000
 Well now more than ever as he said 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.400
 jack the ripper let's go in parts 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400
 the first sentence of this topic is this 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.990
 and doing it twice is very easy in 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.210
 second rope fret 15 we make a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.899
 bending we stretch the rope like this 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.840
 and now we press first fret string 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.540
 13 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.970
 and now on second string fret 13 and 15 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.420
 doing a linked voucher and that phrase are 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.420
 twice 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.109
 again more 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.109
 Hello 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.140
 the second sentence he makes is this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.030
 which is first string fret 15 and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 we make a bless 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.659
 we relax and give in 15 we are 15 a 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 Through bending we relax and now 13 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.799
 12 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 easy no 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.000
 now we come to the main part of the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 theme the best known that is this 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:45.040
 and we do that on fourth fret 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.040
 3 and fret 2 and it would be like that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:56.780
 23 32 the third of those we do like that 3 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:05.470
 32 35 32 voucher 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.470
 other area 33 blogs 23 33 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.860
 I use a little vibrato 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.040
 and I try to make it a bit dappled 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 saying supporting here is worth the palm of the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.530
 hand 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.610
 after that we come here fret 7 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.030
 they keep and we make a phrase that is very 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.030
 similar 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.150
 78 string 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 7 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.110
 okay now 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.660
 when it returns to when it returns to catch 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.120
 The theme is worth it, we wanted to raise it 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 one octave up and we will do the same 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.599
 phrase that we have been doing before 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.489
 but an octave above would then be 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:21.170
 here a tenth fret of the third string 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:24.099
 and fret 9 10 19 919 9 10 9 10 10 92 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.099
 times as before 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.680
 can do so to finish them if 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.660
 you want 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:42.670
 and then we do here fret 14 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 also on third string 14 and 12 14 12 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.560
 14 12 14 12 and now we do 12 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.489
 A) Yes 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.099
 now we do the same sentences again 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.780
 14 12 14 12 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.780
 we do this 14 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.939
 it's worth to you 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.740
 12 and we started the final sentence that is 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.740
 is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.950
 it's very easy it 's always the same 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.550
 sequence with the fingers always being 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.200
 3131 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.390
 and I always repeat the same number of 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.100
 times then we start in the sixth 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:55.710
 rope 10 8 and then we change to 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:01.260
 next rope where they have 10 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.260
 then we climb 12 well on fourth string 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:14.160
 we went up to 14 12 and 15 13 15 13 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.640
 when we have repeated it to us 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.640
 would this be 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.510
 we do the same thing that we have done but 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.510
 only once do we do this 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.360
 sorry we do like that and now we end up in 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.510
 a bending with the fret 13 in second 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.510
 rope 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.090
 no no no 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.700
