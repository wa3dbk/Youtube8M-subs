00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.050
 help from many councils and just a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 advice for first-timers that many of us 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.220
 they are asking about breastfeeding 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.859
 when to breastfeed as we know that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 the baby is hungry is something very 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.680
 important and what concerns them and if 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 crying is synonymous with also having 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.140
 hungry well over feeding in the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.669
 newborn basically or in the child 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 bigger that is called the infant 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.149
 is breast milk has everything has 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.879
 nutrients and has affection not in what 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.550
 moment to breastfeed, there is no pattern 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.160
 established there are no rigid schedules no 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 there are times is free of mani that yes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 be very careful with the once you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 sleeps newborns when they 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.079
 sleep is prudent to wake 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 production increase and lactation 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.070
 also be more effective 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.140
 many moms believe they do not have milk 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.600
 that is false then what are the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.769
 tips if the baby urine has milk if 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 Weight gain has 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.320
 and if he is doing his deposition he has 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.799
 milk then if the mom produces 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 it also means that it is stimulating 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 the production of milk means that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.549
 the child is lactating bill for how much 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.799
 time the baby should be placed in each 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 chest every child has his own pattern 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.479
 I do not know one that only the CTAs in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.579
 just full and that one of a nap 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 small in the the next two 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.750
 baby girls for example that are very active 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 boys usually get a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.549
 cenote what is empty is very important that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.159
 base in zeal because in the final part 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.500
 of the breast there is what is called milk 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.289
 of fattening that the child is laborde 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.039
 has more fats all milk has what 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.929
 maximum has the dh to omega has 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.479
 white blood cells all the nutrients 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.429
 as to create accurate health 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.399
 then it is imprudent that the child is going to 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:03.149
 be the dream when you are already satisfied 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.369
 he falls asleep and if I do not give him the other breast 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.230
 I hope this has served you without 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.240
 another more useful tip 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.510
 I practice mostly for you mom 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.510
