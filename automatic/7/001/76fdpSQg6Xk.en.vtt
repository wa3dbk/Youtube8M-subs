00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
a look at this really quickly because

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.870 
a look at this really quickly because
this<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.500> default<00:01:22.920> speed<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this is actually the default speed that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
this is actually the default speed that
the<00:01:24.119> snowmen<00:01:24.540> move<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.320> colors<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.920> least

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the snowmen move at the colors at least

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.969 
the snowmen move at the colors at least
and<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.299> slow<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and this is actually really slow but it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.170 
and this is actually really slow but it
shouldn't<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.369> moving<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.790> slow<00:01:30.000> either

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
shouldn't be moving this slow either

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600 
shouldn't be moving this slow either
it's<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.400> i

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it's more like it's not like that i

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
it's more like it's not like that i
don't<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.850> why<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.210> moving<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.600> fast<00:01:33.780> right

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
