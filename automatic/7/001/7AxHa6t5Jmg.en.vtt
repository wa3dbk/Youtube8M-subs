about<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.210> product<00:00:51.040> first<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.220> all<00:00:53.110> let<00:00:54.110> me

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
about this product first of all let me

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.770 
about this product first of all let me
start<00:00:54.320> by<00:00:54.710> saying<00:00:54.830> what<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.790> hasn't<00:00:56.270> done<00:00:56.450> it

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
start by saying what it hasn't done it

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.590 
start by saying what it hasn't done it
hasn't<00:00:57.700> rusted<00:00:58.700> it<00:00:58.970> has<00:00:59.720> not<00:01:00.640> broke<00:01:01.640> like<00:01:02.390> any

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
hasn't rusted it has not broke like any

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.229 
hasn't rusted it has not broke like any
of<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.900> wire<00:01:03.110> on<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.710> caging<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:04.729> hasn't

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
of the wire on the caging it hasn't

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.859 
of the wire on the caging it hasn't
broke<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.920> hasn't<00:01:07.490> allowed<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.330> escaped

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
broke it hasn't allowed and escaped

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.760 
broke it hasn't allowed and escaped
minnow<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.890> will<00:01:10.579> escape<00:01:11.259> you'll<00:01:12.259> see<00:01:12.560> that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
minnow to will escape you'll see that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.230 
minnow to will escape you'll see that
the<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:14.359> holes<00:01:14.689> are<00:01:14.960> decently<00:01:15.740> sized<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.609> mean

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the the holes are decently sized I mean

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.480 
the the holes are decently sized I mean
I<00:01:17.390> guess<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.020> could<00:01:18.049> resize<00:01:18.710> them<00:01:18.979> by<00:01:19.189> cutting

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
I guess you could resize them by cutting

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.310 
I guess you could resize them by cutting
off<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.729> little<00:01:20.090> bit<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.420> wire<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.630> allow

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
off a little bit of the wire to allow

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.209 
off a little bit of the wire to allow
bigger<00:01:22.039> minnows<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.999> get<00:01:23.359> in<00:01:23.539> or<00:01:24.069> Shriner's<00:01:25.069> or

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
bigger minnows to get in or Shriner's or

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.069 
bigger minnows to get in or Shriner's or
what<00:01:25.369> or<00:01:25.850> whatever<00:01:26.329> you<00:01:26.509> may<00:01:26.929> call<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.670> and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
what or whatever you may call them and

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.469 
what or whatever you may call them and
it<00:01:30.079> also<00:01:30.409> has<00:01:30.920> not<00:01:31.100> filled<00:01:31.520> with<00:01:31.700> seaweed<00:01:32.149> due

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
it also has not filled with seaweed due

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.889 
it also has not filled with seaweed due
to<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.780> Cape<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.759> awesome<00:01:34.759> caging<00:01:35.299> that

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
to the Cape to the awesome caging that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.419 
to the Cape to the awesome caging that
it<00:01:36.079> has<00:01:36.259> um<00:01:37.659> obviously<00:01:38.799> well<00:01:39.799> that's<00:01:40.039> pretty

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
it has um obviously well that's pretty

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.989 
it has um obviously well that's pretty
important<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.030> like<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:43.549> were<00:01:43.850> to

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
important because like if it were to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.419 
important because like if it were to
fill<00:01:44.210> with<00:01:44.359> seaweed<00:01:44.780> like<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:46.159> couldn't

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
fill with seaweed like you couldn't

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.330 
fill with seaweed like you couldn't
bring<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.789> up<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.200> that's<00:01:48.200> at<00:01:48.649> least<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.100> think

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
bring it up and that's at least I think

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.010 
bring it up and that's at least I think
that's<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.639> pretty<00:01:50.090> big<00:01:50.359> key<00:01:50.600> point<00:01:50.899> because

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's a pretty big key point because

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.809 
that's a pretty big key point because
they'll<00:01:51.679> be<00:01:51.709> pretty<00:01:52.100> annoying<00:01:52.340> having<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
they'll be pretty annoying having to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.660 
they'll be pretty annoying having to
fish<00:01:53.149> your<00:01:53.359> minnow<00:01:54.139> trap<00:01:54.499> out<00:01:54.889> of<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.310> bottom

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
fish your minnow trap out of the bottom

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.819 
fish your minnow trap out of the bottom
of<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:55.999> while<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:56.959> filled<00:01:57.259> with<00:01:57.319> seaweed

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
of and while it's filled with seaweed

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.669 
of and while it's filled with seaweed
but<00:01:58.700> um<00:02:00.310> obviously<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.459> has<00:02:02.109> dented<00:02:03.109> a<00:02:03.289> little

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
but um obviously it has dented a little

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.410 
but um obviously it has dented a little
I<00:02:03.859> mean<00:02:04.069> it's<00:02:04.819> not<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:05.299> bad

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
I mean it's not that bad

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.969 
I mean it's not that bad
but<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.569> like<00:02:08.780> caging<00:02:09.229> what<00:02:09.380> he<00:02:09.470> expected

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
but it's like caging what he expected

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.670 
but it's like caging what he expected
still<00:02:10.399> caging<00:02:10.940> pretty<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.810> too<00:02:12.110> thin<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:12.650> I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
still caging pretty not too thin but I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.100 
still caging pretty not too thin but I
mean<00:02:12.980> thin<00:02:13.700> enough<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.209> den<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> little<00:02:14.870> but

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
mean thin enough to den a little but

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.140 
mean thin enough to den a little but
it's<00:02:15.890> still<00:02:16.189> still<00:02:16.640> fully<00:02:16.909> functional<00:02:17.659> um

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's still still fully functional um

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's still still fully functional um
what<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.750> does<00:02:20.989> do<00:02:21.290> however<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:23.989> decent

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
what it does do however is have a decent

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.869 
what it does do however is have a decent
opening<00:02:25.040> as<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.459> said<00:02:25.700> before<00:02:26.650> allowing<00:02:27.879> pretty

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
opening as I said before allowing pretty

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.680 
opening as I said before allowing pretty
good-sized<00:02:29.690> minutes<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.260> enter<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.790> but

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
good-sized minutes to enter but not but

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.149 
good-sized minutes to enter but not but
they<00:02:32.870> can't<00:02:33.140> leave<00:02:33.379> because<00:02:33.830> obviously

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
they can't leave because obviously

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.690 
they can't leave because obviously
they're<00:02:34.760> too<00:02:35.239> dumb<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.750> go<00:02:36.080> out<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:37.310> opening

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
they're too dumb to go out the opening

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.869 
they're too dumb to go out the opening
but<00:02:38.390> um<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.950> does<00:02:40.129> have<00:02:40.310> two<00:02:40.489> openings

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
but um and it does have two openings

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.240 
but um and it does have two openings
which<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.269> find<00:02:41.599> very<00:02:41.720> useful<00:02:41.959> um<00:02:44.950> hope<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.099> can

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
which I find very useful um hope you can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.890 
which I find very useful um hope you can
see<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.610> by<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:46.849> way<00:02:47.090> um<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:50.030> does<00:02:50.629> have<00:02:50.870> a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
see this by the way um it does have a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.099 
see this by the way um it does have a
place<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.230> hide<00:02:52.129> on<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> rope<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:53.359> you<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:53.930> see

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
place to hide on a rope if you can see

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.110 
place to hide on a rope if you can see
that<00:02:54.290> um<00:02:55.269> I'm<00:02:56.269> using<00:02:56.890> crabbing<00:02:58.120> nylon

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
that um I'm using crabbing nylon

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.800 
that um I'm using crabbing nylon
crabbing<00:02:59.599> wire<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:01.010> uh<00:03:01.180> pull<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.299> up<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.629> tie

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
crabbing wire to uh pull it up and tie

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.009 
crabbing wire to uh pull it up and tie
it<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.170> dock<00:03:03.410> at<00:03:03.650> my<00:03:03.799> wake<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.280> um<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:06.799> in

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
it to the dock at my wake and um it in

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.780 
it to the dock at my wake and um it in
the<00:03:09.019> holes<00:03:09.290> back<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> holes<00:03:10.159> once<00:03:10.549> again

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the holes back to the holes once again

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.119 
the holes back to the holes once again
the<00:03:10.909> holes<00:03:11.120> are<00:03:11.269> not<00:03:11.420> too<00:03:11.720> big<00:03:12.019> but<00:03:12.890> they<00:03:13.069> do

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
the holes are not too big but they do

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.399 
the holes are not too big but they do
allow<00:03:13.609> decent-sized<00:03:14.299> fish<00:03:14.329> so<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.109> mean

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
allow decent-sized fish so like I mean

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.250 
allow decent-sized fish so like I mean
if<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:16.069> wanted<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:16.909> could<00:03:17.120> cut<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:17.989> open

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
if you wanted to you could cut it open

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.160 
if you wanted to you could cut it open
once<00:03:18.620> again<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.209> open<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.780> up<00:03:20.959> a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
once again but just to open it up a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.080 
once again but just to open it up a
little<00:03:21.290> bit<00:03:21.739> more<00:03:21.920> but<00:03:22.220> I'm<00:03:22.489> not<00:03:22.549> gonna<00:03:22.819> do

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
little bit more but I'm not gonna do

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.050 
little bit more but I'm not gonna do
that<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.269> find<00:03:24.230> it's<00:03:24.380> it's<00:03:25.250> just<00:03:25.639> fine<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.030> way

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
that I find it's it's just fine the way

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.680 
that I find it's it's just fine the way
it<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.530> um<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:30.139> it<00:03:30.859> does<00:03:31.730> allow<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.030> rope<00:03:32.419> to<00:03:32.569> be

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
it is um so it does allow the rope to be

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.140 
it is um so it does allow the rope to be
a<00:03:32.720> test<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.829> also<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.400> retaining<00:03:34.880> its

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
a test it and it also is retaining its

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.240 
a test it and it also is retaining its
black<00:03:35.419> coating<00:03:35.900> which<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.769> find<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.190> very

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
black coating which I find is very

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.470 
black coating which I find is very
important<00:03:38.000> which<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:39.790> obviously<00:03:40.790> protecting

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
important which is obviously protecting

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.629 
important which is obviously protecting
it<00:03:41.599> from<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> rust<00:03:42.139> and<00:03:42.500> now<00:03:42.980> allowing<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.609> to

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
it from the rust and now allowing it to

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.349 
it from the rust and now allowing it to
rust

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
rust

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.930 
rust
which<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.870> find<00:03:45.109> very<00:03:45.260> useful<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:48.889> overall<00:03:49.879> I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
which I find very useful so overall I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.939 
which I find very useful so overall I
must<00:03:50.480> say<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.930> very<00:03:50.989> reliable

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
must say it is very reliable

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.110 
must say it is very reliable
um<00:03:53.379> I've<00:03:54.379> used<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.160> two<00:03:55.340> years<00:03:55.639> now<00:03:55.849> this

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
um I've used it for two years now this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.409 
um I've used it for two years now this
would<00:03:56.329> be<00:03:56.359> my<00:03:56.629> third<00:03:56.660> um<00:03:57.970> most<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.120> time

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
would be my third um most of the time

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.000 
would be my third um most of the time
when<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.840> using<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.319> I'll<00:04:00.560> leave<00:04:00.799> it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
when I'm using it I'll leave it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.849 
when I'm using it I'll leave it
overnight<00:04:01.780> there<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.250> um<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.840> still<00:04:06.680> hasn't

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
overnight there and um it still hasn't

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.069 
overnight there and um it still hasn't
rested<00:04:07.160> yeah<00:04:07.639> I<00:04:07.940> mean<00:04:08.239> it's<00:04:08.419> pretty<00:04:08.750> amazing

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
rested yeah I mean it's pretty amazing

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.640 
rested yeah I mean it's pretty amazing
that<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.590> thing<00:04:09.859> is<00:04:09.949> still<00:04:10.160> holding<00:04:10.459> up

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
that this thing is still holding up

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.869 
that this thing is still holding up
because<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.799> all<00:04:12.949> the<00:04:13.040> wear<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.220> tear<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.549> put

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
because of all the wear and tear I put

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.479 
because of all the wear and tear I put
it<00:04:13.970> through<00:04:14.150> but<00:04:14.870> um<00:04:16.389> what<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:18.320> like<00:04:19.099> it

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
it through but um what I but like it

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.510 
it through but um what I but like it
still<00:04:19.970> hasn't<00:04:20.030> rusted<00:04:20.810> which<00:04:21.590> is<00:04:21.769> once<00:04:22.430> again

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
still hasn't rusted which is once again

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.510 
still hasn't rusted which is once again
really<00:04:23.240> cool<00:04:23.690> because<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.169> mean<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:25.400> would

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
really cool because I mean you would

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.320 
really cool because I mean you would
expect<00:04:25.880> wire<00:04:26.389> this<00:04:26.690> thing<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:27.229> rust<00:04:27.440> but<00:04:27.919> I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
expect wire this thing to rust but I

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.970 
expect wire this thing to rust but I
don't<00:04:29.330> know<00:04:29.419> just

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
don't know just

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.130 
don't know just
and<00:04:32.490> another<00:04:33.490> good<00:04:33.880> key<00:04:34.090> point<00:04:34.390> is<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.630> it'll

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
and another good key point is that it'll

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.120 
and another good key point is that it'll
it<00:04:35.500> gives<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:37.600> capability<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.500> opening

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
it gives you the capability of opening

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.340 
it gives you the capability of opening
it<00:04:39.570> which<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.970> obvious<00:04:42.970> because<00:04:43.350> like

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
it which is like obvious because like

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.950 
it which is like obvious because like
how<00:04:44.500> helps<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.980> young<00:04:45.780> open

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
how helps you young open

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.270 
how helps you young open
how<00:04:47.260> y'all<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.740> you're<00:04:47.860> gonna<00:04:47.980> get<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
how y'all it so you're gonna get the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.070 
how y'all it so you're gonna get the
minnows<00:04:48.550> out<00:04:48.730> but<00:04:49.000> as<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.480> can<00:04:49.570> see<00:04:49.630> there's<00:04:50.020> a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
minnows out but as you can see there's a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.290 
minnows out but as you can see there's a
hole<00:04:50.410> on<00:04:52.050> opposite<00:04:53.050> sides<00:04:53.320> on<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:54.580> bottom<00:04:55.090> and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
hole on opposite sides on the bottom and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.210 
hole on opposite sides on the bottom and
then<00:04:55.870> there's<00:04:56.110> two<00:04:56.730> protruding<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:59.380> guess<00:05:00.040> you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
then there's two protruding I guess you

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.080 
then there's two protruding I guess you
could<00:05:00.370> call<00:05:00.400> them<00:05:01.200> prongs<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.850> go<00:05:03.850> into

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
could call them prongs that go into

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.500 
could call them prongs that go into
either<00:05:04.510> hole<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.770> hold<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.100> together<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:09.510> yeah

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
either hole to hold it together and yeah

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.960 
either hole to hold it together and yeah
it's<00:05:10.690> it's<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.380> pretty<00:05:11.770> cool<00:05:12.010> mechanism<00:05:12.700> for

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it's it's a pretty cool mechanism for

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.720 
it's it's a pretty cool mechanism for
keeping<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.750> together<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.830> I<00:05:15.010> mean<00:05:15.040> what<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> do

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
keeping it together but I mean what I do

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.510 
keeping it together but I mean what I do
when<00:05:16.210> I'm<00:05:16.330> carrying<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.840> down<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:17.290> I'll<00:05:17.500> put<00:05:18.250> my

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
when I'm carrying it down is I'll put my

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.170 
when I'm carrying it down is I'll put my
bait<00:05:18.760> in<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.210> in<00:05:19.360> plastic<00:05:20.320> baggies<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.180> so

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
bait in it in plastic baggies and so

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.300 
bait in it in plastic baggies and so
that's<00:05:22.540> one<00:05:22.720> less<00:05:22.930> thing<00:05:22.960> for<00:05:23.710> me<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.920> carry<00:05:24.160> in

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
that's one less thing for me to carry in

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.730 
that's one less thing for me to carry in
my<00:05:24.340> hands<00:05:25.270> cuz<00:05:25.480> I'd<00:05:25.810> normally<00:05:26.080> don't<00:05:26.560> bring

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
my hands cuz I'd normally don't bring

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.920 
my hands cuz I'd normally don't bring
down<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:26.920> backpack<00:05:27.490> so<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.150> probably<00:05:28.390> should<00:05:28.750> do

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
down a backpack so I probably should do

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.890 
down a backpack so I probably should do
but<00:05:29.680> um<00:05:29.920> when<00:05:30.610> I'm<00:05:30.700> walking<00:05:31.210> down<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.540> my<00:05:31.570> lake

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
but um when I'm walking down to my lake

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.350 
but um when I'm walking down to my lake
I'll<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:33.100> throw<00:05:33.280> everything<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.910> here<00:05:34.210> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
I'll just throw everything in here and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.280 
I'll just throw everything in here and
I'm<00:05:34.780> good<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.020> go

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
I'm good to go

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.120 
I'm good to go
and<00:05:36.280> so<00:05:37.180> with<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:38.230> must<00:05:38.590> say<00:05:38.770> it's<00:05:38.890> a<00:05:38.950> very

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
and so with that I must say it's a very

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.520 
and so with that I must say it's a very
reliable<00:05:39.520> product<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.510> I'm<00:05:41.320> not<00:05:42.010> something<00:05:42.340> -<00:05:42.640> I

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530
