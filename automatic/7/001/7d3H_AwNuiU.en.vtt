00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.580
 ah 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.290
 well let's explain now which one 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.640
 be the correct position of the hands 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.349
 both on the right and on the left 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 the right hand has to grasp the cue 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.300
 explaining it in a simple way like 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.699
 that shrinks the handle of a suitcase no no 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.189
 should tighten much taco or 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.010
 let him loose the movement of the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.429
 right hand is the next we have to 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.660
 try that the taco always goes the most 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.970
 possible parallel to the table then 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.650
 we reach the end of the journey towards 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.670
 back we have to open a little palm 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.410
 to allow that the cue goes 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.900
 parallel 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.370
 and we always try to take advantage of all the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.760
 travel between the ball and the hand 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.980
 left we always try that the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.540
 movement is only forearm and 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.540
 the arm just move at the end 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.530
 with the left hand we try to do 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.070
 What we call ring that is treated 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 that the cue passes between the two fingers 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.060
 and do not go to the right nor 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 to the left more than a ring what 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.229
 which is intended to be a lane 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.710
 then this part of here where 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.380
 put together these two fingers has to fit 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 there so that the cue does not go to the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.340
 right or to the left depending on 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 the height at which we want to hit the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.490
 so we will put our hand to hit 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.490
 above 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.580
 we move our fingers for a medium shot 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.790
 and another different position when we want 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.790
 attack down 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.189
 by a position other than the hand 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.399
 left is when we have the ball 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 player close to what 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.390
 we call railing 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 we take this possible 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.790
 and the last posture of the left hand 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.150
 is when we have to execute some 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.550
 Special shot of more or pique that are 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.350
 shots in which the cue has to be 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.350
 in a practically vertical position 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.130
 ah
