so here's one of my lenses that i use my
nikon<00:00:27.779> 28<00:00:28.699> 280<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.380> as<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.949> top

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
nikon 28 280 and as you can see on top

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.990 
nikon 28 280 and as you can see on top
it<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.340> extension<00:00:35.340> tubes<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it has one of the extension tubes on it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
it has one of the extension tubes on it
to<00:00:36.120> 20<00:00:36.420> millimeter<00:00:37.340> which<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:39.530> right

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to 20 millimeter which is like right

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.150 
to 20 millimeter which is like right
there<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> 20<00:00:41.219> millimeter<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
there to 20 millimeter and then this

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.410 
there to 20 millimeter and then this
right<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:46.190> let's<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.059> what's

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
what what's this is a 12 millimeter and

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
what what's this is a 12 millimeter and
these<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.590> subjects<00:00:56.719> couple<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:58.020> itty

millimeter<00:01:51.470> 1.8<00:01:53.030> nikon<00:01:54.030> lens<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.100> what

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
millimeter 1.8 nikon lens so that's what

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.740 
millimeter 1.8 nikon lens so that's what
i'm<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.909> taking<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.420> pictures

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
i'm going to be taking these pictures

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.950 
i'm going to be taking these pictures
wit<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.909> showing<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> results<00:02:00.750> from

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
wit and showing you the results from

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.580 
wit and showing you the results from
that<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:04.290> check<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.009> out

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.410 

so<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.070> next<00:02:11.400> few<00:02:11.520> shots<00:02:11.880> you're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so the next few shots you're going to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.020 
so the next few shots you're going to
see<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.580> right<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:16.460> these<00:02:17.460> tiny<00:02:17.880> little

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
see is this right here these tiny little

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
see is this right here these tiny little
shelves<00:02:18.720> inside<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.100> shale<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:22.650> going

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
shelves inside of a shale and I'm going

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.580 
shelves inside of a shale and I'm going
to<00:02:22.980> set<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.960> with<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> couple<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
to set this up with a couple of the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
to set this up with a couple of the
shots<00:02:25.920> close<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.520> shots<00:02:26.820> using<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.510> 19<00:02:28.610> no

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
shots close up shots using the 19 no

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:44.150 
shots close up shots using the 19 no
actually<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.210> 18<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:32.160> 1<00:02:32.580> 35<00:02:33.150> millimeter

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.220 

you
