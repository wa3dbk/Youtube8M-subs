 conscious feeding feeding 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.670
 alive today we moved a little bit more 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.099
 here in san luis at the hotel the volcano 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.670
 we have amaranth, look what is the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 amaranth this pseudo serial very rich in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.880
 essential amino acids here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 there is the raw amaranth seed and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.379
 then here we have previously cooked the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 Amaranth cooking is very, very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.730
 easy then it's a super salad 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 practice the idea of which ones I had left 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 Amaranth stick I can do here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.539
 is the solution for all your 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.539
 problems 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 we cut the unknowns 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 but rather fast well fine well 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 rustic good 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.580
 my employees finished 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580
 to the fire 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.659
 just a trickle of olive oil 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.460
 but you will see me a little bit 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.870
 we incorporate vegetables 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.870
 and to cook gentlemen 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 Pepper 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 and we move a lot we are not attending 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.300
 because I want to brown and if you want 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.390
 gild patience quiet and only 0 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.110
 a little bit of leek as well the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.140
 leek is finally going 'no olives let's go 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.170
 now the olive also 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.080
 we are doing a bit the table of the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.760
 table the garlic not yet because the garlic is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.540
 it's going to burn you but get incorporated in this 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.540
 stage let's go 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.240
 does not have this technique grabs listen 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.690
 mix with the spoon is not any 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.690
 problem 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.440
 well this point 23 minutes just garlic and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.860
 because I left the tomato and the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.260
 cucumber because it is up to 90% water 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.420
 liquid therefore this is not going away 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.270
 kitchen is not going to brown me 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.780
 all the liquid and I do not want that to happen 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.000
 I incorporate amaranth that we already cooked 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.390
 previously if you have left over spectacular 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.390

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.400
 put out the fire a good trickle of 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.819
 olive oil again pepper for 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.450
 that it stings well 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.380

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.680
 to enhance the flavor a little bit of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.680
 lemon 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.360
 the spectacular acidity 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.830
 Gentlemen we finished 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.330
 of olive oil 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.490
