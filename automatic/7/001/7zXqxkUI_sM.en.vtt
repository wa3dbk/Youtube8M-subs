scan again and the back there
yeah<00:01:18.429> get<00:01:19.429> into<00:01:19.700> boobie<00:01:20.119> legs<00:01:20.359> get<00:01:20.750> into

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
yeah get into boobie legs get into

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.859 
yeah get into boobie legs get into
boobie<00:01:21.289> leg<00:01:21.579> get<00:01:22.579> in<00:01:22.700> there<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.119> think<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.689> back

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
boobie leg get in there I think the back

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.230 
boobie leg get in there I think the back
is<00:01:24.049> slightly<00:01:24.320> longer<00:01:24.590> than<00:01:24.710> from<00:01:25.100> bit<00:01:25.340> all

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
is slightly longer than from bit all

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.770 
is slightly longer than from bit all
right<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.659> this<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.049> my<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:27.259> am<00:01:27.590> blowout<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.880> I'm

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
right so this is my I am blowout and I'm

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.999 
right so this is my I am blowout and I'm
just<00:01:30.500> about<00:01:30.859> to<00:01:31.780> start<00:01:32.780> putting<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.500> into<00:01:33.649> flat

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
just about to start putting it into flat

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.100 
just about to start putting it into flat
twist<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.880> um<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.380> if<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.860> want<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.069> watch<00:01:37.280> me

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
twist so um and if you want to watch me

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.480 
twist so um and if you want to watch me
just<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.289> my<00:01:39.880> red<00:01:40.880> comb<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.299> my<00:01:41.420> partings<00:01:41.869> and

and i think i might even i never yielded

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:06.420 
and i think i might even i never yielded

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
let's do it like that okay and what's I

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.140 
let's do it like that okay and what's I
always<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:11.350> on<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.560> side<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.220> don't<00:02:13.000> need<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
always go on this side I don't need to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.240 
always go on this side I don't need to
come<00:02:13.750> for<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.020> rest<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.470> for<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> main

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
doesn't look like that when um it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.400 
doesn't look like that when um it
doesn't<00:04:57.010> look<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.430> when<00:04:57.820> live<00:04:58.090> on<00:04:58.410> its

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
doesn't look like that when live on its

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.580 
doesn't look like that when live on its
own<00:04:59.560> put<00:04:59.830> more<00:05:00.250> moisturizer<00:05:00.790> Liam's<00:05:01.290> yeah<00:05:02.290> it

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
own put more moisturizer Liam's yeah it

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.560 
own put more moisturizer Liam's yeah it
doesn't<00:05:02.800> look<00:05:03.130> like<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.760> when<00:05:04.120> my<00:05:04.180> hair's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
doesn't look like this when my hair's

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.260 
doesn't look like this when my hair's
wet<00:05:04.980> because<00:05:05.980> there's<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.580> bit<00:05:06.850> frizzy

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
wet because there's a little bit frizzy

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.220 
wet because there's a little bit frizzy
bits<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.050> all<00:05:08.139> sorts<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:10.660> think<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.110> it's

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
bits and all sorts and I think that it's

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.170 
bits and all sorts and I think that it's
straight<00:05:11.590> sometimes<00:05:12.250> what<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:12.400> tend<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.730> do<00:05:12.910> to

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
straight sometimes what I tend to do to

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.210 
straight sometimes what I tend to do to
keep<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:14.200> keep<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.500> tension<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.040> that<00:05:15.070> it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
keep the to keep the tension so that it

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.150 
keep the to keep the tension so that it
stays<00:05:15.430> nice<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:15.730> tight<00:05:16.740> then<00:05:17.740> what<00:05:18.010> I<00:05:18.040> would

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
stays nice and tight then what I would

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.610 
stays nice and tight then what I would
do<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.729> I<00:05:18.790> would<00:05:19.419> twist<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.110> around<00:05:20.200> like<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.590> I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
do is I would twist it around like so I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.100 
do is I would twist it around like so I
do<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.520> knocked<00:05:21.790> out<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.240> not<00:05:22.600> like<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:22.930> or

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
do and knocked out and not like this or

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.840 
do and knocked out and not like this or
bantu<00:05:23.440> knot<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:24.160> twist<00:05:24.400> about<00:05:24.520> this

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
bantu knot and I twist about this

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.950 
bantu knot and I twist about this
because<00:05:24.970> then<00:05:25.150> what<00:05:25.300> happens<00:05:25.600> is<00:05:25.690> when<00:05:25.870> it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
because then what happens is when it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.110 
because then what happens is when it
dries<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.200> dries<00:05:26.590> flat<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.400> then<00:05:27.729> what<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:27.910> tend

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
dries it dries flat and then what I tend

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.210 
dries it dries flat and then what I tend
to<00:05:28.180> do<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.360> unravel<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.960> afterwards<00:05:29.500> but

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
to do is unravel it afterwards but

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.890 
to do is unravel it afterwards but
