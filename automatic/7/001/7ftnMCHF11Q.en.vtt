00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.630
 jones monte 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 it is charged 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370
 yes 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.379
 the one that roger useless and his low showed 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.090
 droid and as you just saw there is the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.940
 intro of this new terminator game that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 knows how to get out looks very promising and what 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.110
 better the case is that it is free weighs very 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.760
 little and is in Spanish and good has a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 little problem there with the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.809
 multitask 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 Salem omit in all history this 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.900
 they have to support us all the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 story they have to see it but as 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 you can see a little detail with the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 multitasking when they open it they showed off the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 multitask sometimes the bar below 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.780
 Android does not hide and covers them 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 piece the screen which is very weird 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.790
 so let's cut and we're going to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.230
 continue to fix that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.060
 let's go back what has to be 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.340
 for this to be removed or not happen to them 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.930
 if they have to pop it is simply 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.700
 block is what the screen is 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 radio the game and distraction of the bar 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 down and well let's start you can 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.860
 hear me what we need without filters 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.050
 at the entrance to the west and that is what 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.760
 speak now if we play also for 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.870
 hide ok see the graphics so 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.510
 incredible 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.500
 I do not think weighing less than 100 megs the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.500
 download let's see 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.810
 it's normal for you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.100
 because there are people that they saw was another 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.259
 small bus that has the game if they saw 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 half of the other blue screens yes 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.380
 what happens please comment it will be very 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
 sad in the place they tell you that the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.520
 game has problems like that in fact in 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.670
 the writing stories were 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.890
 commenting that the engine looked weird 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.599
 game then I have not tried it there but 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.580
 yes i saw comment is grab the graphics 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.019
 in the motogp and well here to me our 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.120
 background is what the bar suddenly 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.890
 hide and when you sometimes go in and go out 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.420
 of the game half of the screen is 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.950
 it turns blue and happens what you just saw 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.720
 right now let's see if that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.660
 mission selected for the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.580
 rivals let's see new in games to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.230
 promises enough has good action 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.180
 has some graphics will have the same time 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.519
 It weighs very little but it has one or another 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 detail how it has just come out is that 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.459
 is the one that update it and so on and so 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.319
 not on all the devices you can 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.900
 pass this let's see we need that 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.830
 Cuts I say you 're a distraction 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.470
 destroyed not the answer can be 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.180
 Boosting leader your secondary karma for 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.760
 change the grenades ok 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.150
 a grenade 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.920
 or that there is a link out there that nothing is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.640
 limited and very difficult to find use them 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.640
 carefully 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.680
 here 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.079
 there are small causes of water and on the other 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.230
 with my reason 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.560
 all right 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.680
 now they say full of water was very 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.810
 very fast and instead came the other time 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.510
 so can not miss that change between my 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.909
 wolf videos uploaded by strong we are going to 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.760
 see and the next rÃ©quiem rÃ©flex mission 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.959
 sniper here that then buy and what 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.250
 that I like this game and of all the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.200
 who has been dating lately 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.910
 that explain everything with little arrows and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.950
 everything as well as what does this do this 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.530
 do this then you are not going to 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.750
 struggle because then that which of the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.610
 Principle of laughing explaining everything 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.200
 step by step for you to see 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.819
 that what they have to do and how he 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 he said anything weird they notice 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.569
 comment on the place thor comment this 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.640
 with your Android solution device 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.470
 so that what bread can give this one 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.200
 what devices does it happen and what 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.730
 can fix and then and yes yes 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.730
 improved that you win with how weird 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.829
 we have a sniper rifle 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.829
 headshot 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 I do not want to spend worries 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.650
 that being here are far away 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.740
 perfect and people believe everything for this 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.410
 video the game is going let's go 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.690
 obviously more and more and more and more and more 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.340
 difficult right now it's like the most 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.570
 basic they are explaining everything that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.930
 you have to do what you do not have to 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.580
 touch you can improve your weapons see the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.160
 shooting range the speed the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.220
 resistance 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.290
 and then let's get out of here we go and 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.300
 the transmission plus the last one and we're going 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.070
 ok so we can see how the game 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.690
 true that he was very very good and what 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.700
 I like the most is the weight is very light 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.470
 but just as in case you have 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.030
 a problem out there with the weight them 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.360
 they download the inscription a tutorial after 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.500
 how to install games on the sd card and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.100
 may know 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.980
 God 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.980
 a little to wish more curiosity 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.289
 goodbye but the graphics look 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:25.930
 incredible and did not get over it 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.930
 terminator I am very good and I live 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.030
 that he wants to fight 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.080
 do not give the head but 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.080
 He did not stop for a while 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.490
 and I think we just got the mission very 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.250
 quick in fact start children as well as 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.930
 tell me fast but what they are going 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.550
 Obviously advancing as they are put 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.280
 harder longer with more 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.200
 enemies and possibly longer so 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.820
 I hope they do not go with those 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.680
 pauses they suddenly gave me because 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.240
 Well, I think it's not normal, but 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.460
 nothing is very good game I think now 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.630
 if everything is uploaded they take care of their 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.070
 law if you liked the link in the 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.180
 instruction yebes people I think that already 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.730
 it is for this it is well enough the 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.730
 Interest in description are taken care of and bye
