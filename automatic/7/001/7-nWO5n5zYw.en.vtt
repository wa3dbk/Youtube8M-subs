00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580 
players truly are but just from judging
by<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.359> fact<00:03:33.719> that<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.109> great<00:03:34.319> one<00:03:34.469> is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
by the fact that the great one is

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
by the fact that the great one is
throwing<00:03:34.890> up<00:03:34.950> two<00:03:35.159> cannons<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.790> had<00:03:35.969> some

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
throwing up two cannons and had some

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.789 
throwing up two cannons and had some
sellouts<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.810> kind<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.019> chilling<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
sellouts just kind of chilling here and

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.490 
sellouts just kind of chilling here and
a<00:03:37.859> forge<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:38.609> no<00:03:39.239> real<00:03:39.510> build<00:03:39.870> order<00:03:40.200> hasn't

really<00:03:40.829> gotten<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.189> gases<00:03:41.609> yet<00:03:41.819> we're<00:03:42.060> just

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
really gotten the gases yet we're just

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.970 
really gotten the gases yet we're just
going<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.420> assume<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> he's<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.950> know

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
going to assume that he's you know

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.890 
going to assume that he's you know
somewhere<00:03:44.489> around<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.970> bronze<00:03:45.359> level<00:03:45.659> or

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
not doing too bad looks like he's

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.330 
not doing too bad looks like he's

and it looks like pain users queens are
actually<00:04:19.019> getting<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.320> little<00:04:19.530> bit<00:04:19.769> stuck<00:04:20.250> so

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
actually getting a little bit stuck so

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.249 
actually getting a little bit stuck so
this<00:04:21.180> queen<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.570> spun<00:04:21.810> out<00:04:21.959> here<00:04:21.989> is

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
this queen that spun out here is

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.689 
this queen that spun out here is
actually<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.979> be<00:04:23.070> stuck<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.580> not

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
actually going to be stuck it's not

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.710 
actually going to be stuck it's not
going<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:23.970> able<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.180> make<00:04:24.240> its<00:04:24.509> way<00:04:24.690> into

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
going to be able to make its way into

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.589 
going to be able to make its way into
the<00:04:25.020> base<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:26.009> could<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> problem<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:27.030> our

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
the base that could be a problem for our

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.990 
the base that could be a problem for our
epic<00:04:28.349> strategy<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.190> we've<00:04:29.310> cooked<00:04:29.580> up<00:04:29.789> for

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
epic strategy that we've cooked up for

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.420 
epic strategy that we've cooked up for
today's<00:04:30.330> game<00:04:30.800> now<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.860> nice<00:04:32.099> thing<00:04:32.130> about

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
today's game now the nice thing about

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.060 
today's game now the nice thing about
this<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.570> build<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.409> plop<00:04:34.770> up<00:04:34.949> a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
this this build is you can plop up a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.469 
this this build is you can plop up a
spine<00:04:35.340> crawler<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.970> then<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.210> can<00:04:36.330> use

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
spine crawler and then you can use

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.480 
spine crawler and then you can use
Queens<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.110> transfuse<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.979> baby<00:04:38.220> all<00:04:38.460> day

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
Queens to transfuse that baby all day

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.350 
Queens to transfuse that baby all day
long<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.650> with<00:04:40.949> that<00:04:41.190> it's<00:04:41.610> really<00:04:42.030> hard<00:04:42.240> for

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
long so with that it's really hard for

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.330 
long so with that it's really hard for
an<00:04:42.690> enemy<00:04:43.020> rush<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.440> push<00:04:43.680> into<00:04:43.919> your<00:04:44.130> base

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
an enemy rush to push into your base

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.710 
an enemy rush to push into your base
because<00:04:44.669> they've<00:04:44.789> got<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.090> run<00:04:45.449> through<00:04:45.630> this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
because they've got to run through this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600 
because they've got to run through this
narrow<00:04:45.930> choke<00:04:46.349> they've<00:04:47.039> got<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.340> deal<00:04:47.490> with<00:04:47.520> a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
narrow choke they've got to deal with a

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.430 
narrow choke they've got to deal with a
spine<00:04:47.970> crawler<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.539> has<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:48.930> infinite

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
spine crawler that has like infinite

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.070 
spine crawler that has like infinite
health<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:50.639> pretty<00:04:51.270> epic<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:51.990> we

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
health so it's pretty epic and here we

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.379 
health so it's pretty epic and here we
go<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.949> nidus<00:04:53.280> Network<00:04:53.580> coming<00:04:53.880> down<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.270> now

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
go the nidus Network coming down so now

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.180 
go the nidus Network coming down so now
you<00:04:54.449> guys<00:04:54.659> can<00:04:54.900> kind<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.320> imagine<00:04:55.440> what<00:04:56.039> we're

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
you guys can kind of imagine what we're

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.950 
you guys can kind of imagine what we're
going<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.370> do<00:04:56.520> both<00:04:56.849> of<00:04:56.909> us<00:04:57.150> are<00:04:57.419> going<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.720> get

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
going to do both of us are going to get

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.930 
going to do both of us are going to get
a<00:04:58.169> night<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.919> not<00:04:59.039> where<00:04:59.190> pain<00:04:59.460> is<00:04:59.610> actually

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940

a night it's not where pain is actually
thrown<00:05:00.150> his<00:05:00.360> outside<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.990> base<00:05:01.110> because

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
thrown his outside of the base because

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230 
thrown his outside of the base because
his<00:05:01.650> queens<00:05:01.979> are<00:05:02.130> all<00:05:02.250> spawning<00:05:02.639> outside<00:05:03.120> of

our way with Queens into somebody's base
somebody<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.449> gonna<00:05:09.750> get<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.169> oh<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.440> can't<00:05:10.949> wait
