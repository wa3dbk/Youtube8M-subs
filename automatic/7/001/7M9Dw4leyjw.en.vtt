would<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:03.250> use<00:04:03.700> scissors<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.450> are

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
would be to use scissors that are

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.319 
would be to use scissors that are
actually<00:04:05.230> sharp<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:07.049> these<00:04:08.049> ones<00:04:08.230> are<00:04:08.470> not<00:04:08.620> and

the<00:04:15.160> card<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.180> use<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.840> it's<00:04:17.220> thicker<00:04:18.220> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
the card you use if it's thicker and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.400 
the card you use if it's thicker and

it's<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.470> bit<00:04:23.590> flimsy<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:25.530> they're<00:04:26.530> kind<00:04:26.680> of

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
it's a bit flimsy so they're kind of

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.140 
it's a bit flimsy so they're kind of
wobble<00:04:27.039> around<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:28.770> stiff<00:04:29.770> guard<00:04:30.150> good

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
wobble around so stiff guard good
