base out of obsidian but if you want to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.330 
base out of obsidian but if you want to
set<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.049> ton<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.349> time<00:02:21.680> don't<00:02:22.159> do<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.120> um

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
set up a ton of time don't do that so um

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.420 
set up a ton of time don't do that so um
Here<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.489> am<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.379> little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.709> i'm<00:02:27.920> going<00:02:28.220> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
fill the entire wall with TT almost now

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.149 
fill the entire wall with TT almost now
completely<00:02:32.359> but<00:02:32.599> almost<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.840> yeah<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.739> good

completely but almost so yeah a good
thing<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.609> get<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.970> much<00:02:38.180> obsidian<00:02:38.870> is

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
thing to get that much obsidian is

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.210 
thing to get that much obsidian is
you're<00:02:39.379> going<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> make<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.950> giant<00:02:41.530> OB<00:02:42.530> gin<00:02:42.829> or

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
you're going to make a giant OB gin or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.009 
you're going to make a giant OB gin or
I'm<00:02:43.609> sitting<00:02:43.849> generator<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.420> call<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.750> aa<00:02:44.870> bhi

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
I'm sitting generator we call it aa bhi

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.770 
I'm sitting generator we call it aa bhi
but<00:02:45.859> so<00:02:46.639> really<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.329> have<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.599> is

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
but so really all you have to do is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.550 
but so really all you have to do is
build<00:02:47.989> too<00:02:48.349> long<00:02:48.620> trenches<00:02:49.159> um<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.810> are<00:02:51.019> one

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
build too long trenches um that are one

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.170 
build too long trenches um that are one
is<00:02:51.709> three<00:02:51.950> blocks<00:02:52.099> d<00:02:52.400> point<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.879> two<00:02:53.030> blocks

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
is three blocks d point is two blocks

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.349 
is three blocks d point is two blocks
deep<00:02:53.540> one<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.349> those<00:02:54.500> three<00:02:54.709> blocks<00:02:54.980> deep<00:02:55.359> goes

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
deep one of those three blocks deep goes

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.479 
deep one of those three blocks deep goes
um<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.260> throw<00:02:57.439> out<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.829> water<00:02:58.069> not

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
um you throw out up with water not

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.849 
um you throw out up with water not
entirely<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.299> it's<00:02:59.450> almost<00:03:00.139> flowing<00:03:00.769> in

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
entirely but so it's almost flowing in

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.970 
entirely but so it's almost flowing in
the<00:03:00.950> other<00:03:01.129> one<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.459> there<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.180> also<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.980> piece

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the other one and there is also a piece

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.170 
the other one and there is also a piece
of<00:03:04.010> dirt<00:03:04.189> in<00:03:04.250> between<00:03:04.609> it<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:04.879> like<00:03:05.060> it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
of dirt in between it so like it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.119 
of dirt in between it so like it
separates<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.870> two<00:03:05.900> trenches<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.530> then

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
separates the two trenches and then

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.349 
separates the two trenches and then
you're<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:08.739> throw<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.250> other<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.519> with

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
you're going to throw the other one with

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.860 
you're going to throw the other one with
lava<00:03:11.900> over<00:03:12.680> redstone<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:14.359> is<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.750> basic

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
lava over redstone this is just a basic

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.470 
lava over redstone this is just a basic
thing<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.470> then<00:03:15.739> it'll<00:03:16.000> make<00:03:17.000> your<00:03:17.180> Sid<00:03:17.329> Ian

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
thing and then it'll make your Sid Ian

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.699 
thing and then it'll make your Sid Ian
so<00:03:17.959> right<00:03:18.079> here<00:03:18.260> I'm<00:03:18.319> going<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.500> run<00:03:18.620> across

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
so right here I'm going to run across

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.860 
so right here I'm going to run across
and<00:03:18.919> I'm<00:03:19.400> gonna<00:03:19.549> throw<00:03:20.060> almost<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.629> entire

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
and I'm gonna throw almost the entire

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.890 
and I'm gonna throw almost the entire
thing<00:03:20.900> with<00:03:21.290> TMT<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.829> fall<00:03:22.099> off<00:03:22.250> at<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> end

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
thing with TMT but I fall off at the end

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.479 
thing with TMT but I fall off at the end
so<00:03:23.900> right<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.799> blow<00:03:24.980> up<00:03:25.160> and

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
so right here it's going to blow up and

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.819 
so right here it's going to blow up and
it<00:03:25.699> doesn't<00:03:26.389> do<00:03:26.480> any<00:03:26.750> damage<00:03:27.049> as<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.470> can<00:03:27.590> see

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
it doesn't do any damage as you can see

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.259 
it doesn't do any damage as you can see
so<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.519> not<00:03:29.419> entirely<00:03:30.169> some<00:03:31.030> amazing<00:03:32.030> I

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
so this is not entirely some amazing I

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.990 
so this is not entirely some amazing I
mean<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.930> know<00:03:32.959> it's<00:03:33.230> very<00:03:33.319> basic<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:34.400> will<00:03:34.639> not

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
mean I know it's very basic it will not

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.319 
mean I know it's very basic it will not
make<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.230> entire<00:03:36.620> fortress<00:03:37.310> briefing<00:03:38.030> proof

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
make the entire fortress briefing proof

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.240 
make the entire fortress briefing proof
it<00:03:38.900> won't<00:03:39.079> do<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.290> it'll<00:03:39.650> only<00:03:39.889> make<00:03:40.040> it

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
it won't do that it'll only make it
