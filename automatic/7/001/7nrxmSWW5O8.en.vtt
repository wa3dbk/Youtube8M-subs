00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
little fpv camera right here and they've

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
got a second flavour which i've got

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.620 
got a second flavour which i've got
hooked<00:00:36.340> up<00:00:36.490> and<00:00:36.880> we'll<00:00:37.000> go<00:00:37.120> over<00:00:37.150> it<00:00:37.360> here<00:00:37.420> in<00:00:37.570> a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
hooked up and we'll go over it here in a

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.360 
hooked up and we'll go over it here in a
second<00:00:37.990> this<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.440> 30x<00:00:38.890> now<00:00:39.100> these<00:00:39.220> are

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
second this is the 30x now these are

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.080 
second this is the 30x now these are
actual<00:00:39.670> optical<00:00:40.450> zoom<00:00:40.650> fpv<00:00:41.650> cameras<00:00:42.070> now<00:00:42.550> of

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
actual optical zoom fpv cameras now of

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.550 
actual optical zoom fpv cameras now of
course<00:00:43.360> it<00:00:43.480> comes<00:00:43.600> with<00:00:43.750> nice<00:00:44.020> isolated

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
course it comes with nice isolated

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.590 
course it comes with nice isolated
mounts<00:00:44.830> for<00:00:44.980> direct<00:00:45.250> mounting<00:00:45.910> but<00:00:46.329> in<00:00:46.480> my

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
mounts for direct mounting but in my

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.210 
mounts for direct mounting but in my
opinion<00:00:46.720> if<00:00:47.140> you're<00:00:47.260> running<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.650> zoom<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.100> would

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
opinion if you're running a zoom I would

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.770 
opinion if you're running a zoom I would
probably<00:00:48.370> put<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.760> on<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> gimbal<00:00:49.329> because<00:00:49.600> as

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
probably put it on a gimbal because as

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.620 
probably put it on a gimbal because as
you<00:00:50.350> zoom<00:00:50.590> out<00:00:50.770> optically<00:00:51.340> as<00:00:51.730> stability<00:00:52.240> is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
you zoom out optically as stability is

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.150 
you zoom out optically as stability is
going<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.840> definitely<00:00:53.079> become<00:00:53.530> an<00:00:53.680> issue<00:00:53.829> and

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
going to definitely become an issue and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400 
going to definitely become an issue and
vibration<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.720> know<00:00:55.810> I<00:00:55.840> think<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.230> is

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
vibration so you know I think this is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.590 
vibration so you know I think this is
more<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.890> token<00:00:57.280> mount<00:00:57.489> but<00:00:58.030> in<00:00:58.120> reality<00:00:58.300> I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
more of a token mount but in reality I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.240 
more of a token mount but in reality I
would<00:00:58.720> just<00:00:58.960> get<00:00:59.110> yourself<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.680> nicely<00:01:00.220> a

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
would just get yourself a nicely a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.600 
would just get yourself a nicely a
digital<00:01:01.000> SLR<00:01:01.120> or<00:01:01.480> mid-sized<00:01:02.110> ax<00:01:02.399> gimbal<00:01:03.399> and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
digital SLR or mid-sized ax gimbal and

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.090 
digital SLR or mid-sized ax gimbal and
then<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.390> just<00:01:04.420> velcro<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.350> right<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.920> that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
then and just velcro it right on to that

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.130 
then and just velcro it right on to that
and<00:01:06.310> run<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.670> as<00:01:06.790> your<00:01:06.940> fpv<00:01:07.360> camera<00:01:07.570> but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
and run that as your fpv camera but

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.450 
and run that as your fpv camera but
anyway<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.500> cool<00:01:08.650> thing<00:01:08.860> about<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.430> that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
anyway the cool thing about this is that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.940 
anyway the cool thing about this is that
it<00:01:09.729> has<00:01:09.820> RC<00:01:10.300> control<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.170> by<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.530> mean<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
it has RC control and by that I mean the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.469 
it has RC control and by that I mean the
zoom<00:01:12.190> is<00:01:12.400> able<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.760> be<00:01:12.850> controlled<00:01:13.210> via<00:01:13.360> a

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
zoom is able to be controlled via a

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.930 
zoom is able to be controlled via a
standard<00:01:13.690> aux<00:01:14.260> channel<00:01:14.770> or<00:01:15.130> auxilary<00:01:15.520> channel

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
standard aux channel or auxilary channel

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.330 
standard aux channel or auxilary channel

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
Sun bla with HLM and a few other neat

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.840 
Sun bla with HLM and a few other neat
things<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:32.500> now<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.130> overall<00:01:33.310> package

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
things on that now the overall package

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.969 
things on that now the overall package
of<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.479> camera<00:01:34.810> looks<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.140> little<00:01:35.380> bit<00:01:35.500> larger

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
of the camera looks a little bit larger

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.920 
of the camera looks a little bit larger
but<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.119> composite<00:01:37.720> frame

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
but this is all just a composite frame

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.810 
but this is all just a composite frame
and<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.440> reality<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:39.070> fairly<00:01:39.310> light<00:01:39.580> if<00:01:39.729> you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
and in reality it's fairly light if you

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.100 
and in reality it's fairly light if you
take<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.000> look<00:01:40.210> at<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.450> specs<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.810> think<00:01:41.020> this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
take a look at the specs I think this

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.010 
take a look at the specs I think this
one's<00:01:41.290> right<00:01:41.470> about<00:01:41.710> 165<00:01:42.610> grams<00:01:42.970> for<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
one's right about 165 grams for the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.170 
one's right about 165 grams for the
camera<00:01:44.350> itself<00:01:44.619> so<00:01:44.799> it's<00:01:44.950> pretty<00:01:45.130> light<00:01:45.430> even

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
camera itself so it's pretty light even

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.280 
camera itself so it's pretty light even
though<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> little<00:01:46.659> bit<00:01:46.869> larger<00:01:47.260> in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
though it is a little bit larger in

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.630 
though it is a little bit larger in
package<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:47.860> if<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:48.040> take<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> look<00:01:48.400> at<00:01:48.549> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
package but if you take a look at the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.520 
package but if you take a look at the
overall<00:01:48.880> size<00:01:49.180> it's<00:01:49.810> really<00:01:50.049> just<00:01:50.200> not<00:01:50.290> that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
overall size it's really just not that

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.380 
overall size it's really just not that
big<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:51.010> matter<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.580> fact<00:01:51.760> if<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:51.939> tout<00:01:52.240> and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
big a matter of fact if you tout and

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.149 
big a matter of fact if you tout and
look<00:01:52.510> at<00:01:52.630> their<00:01:52.840> webpage<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.740> check<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.070> out

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
look at their webpage and check it out

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
look at their webpage and check it out
they<00:01:54.580> show<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:54.909> flying<00:01:55.210> underneath<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.840> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.110 
on the back and I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:02:23.230> zoom<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.040> guys<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.460> see<00:02:24.670> gives

and zoom in so you guys can see gives
you<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.360> zoom<00:02:25.660> level<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.680> can

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
you the zoom level right in here you can

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.830 
you the zoom level right in here you can
turn<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.430> OSD<00:02:27.910> off<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.510> see<00:02:28.690> how

turn that OSD off and you can see how

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.530 
turn that OSD off and you can see how
quickly<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.290> has<00:02:29.590> already<00:02:29.890> focused<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:31.360> now

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
quickly it has already focused right now

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620 
quickly it has already focused right now
we're<00:02:31.750> on<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.580> wall<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:33.850> I'm<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.510> gonna

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
we're on the wall here I'm just gonna

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.390 
we're on the wall here I'm just gonna
throw<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.960> out<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.350> focus<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.130> move<00:02:36.280> my

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
throw it out of focus and then move my

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
throw it out of focus and then move my
hand<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.850> you'll<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.090> how<00:02:37.240> fast<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.720> comes

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
hand and you'll see how fast it comes

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
hand and you'll see how fast it comes
right<00:02:38.140> back<00:02:38.320> into<00:02:38.560> focus<00:02:41.040> extremely<00:02:42.040> fast<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
right back into focus extremely fast and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.940 
right back into focus extremely fast and
of<00:02:42.910> course<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.330> can<00:02:43.540> control<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.290> zoom<00:02:44.530> via

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
of course you can control the zoom via

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
of course you can control the zoom via
RC<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.580> we're<00:02:45.730> talking<00:02:45.880> about<00:02:47.700> really<00:02:48.700> nice

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
RC like we're talking about really nice

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.699 
RC like we're talking about really nice
camera<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.750> course<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.050> was<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.380> was

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
camera and of course I was like I was

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.620 
camera and of course I was like I was
saying<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.100> Sony<00:02:51.459> CCD<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.480> it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
saying it's a Sony CCD in there so it's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.770 
saying it's a Sony CCD in there so it's
a<00:02:52.750> excellent<00:02:53.380> optical<00:02:53.680> 700<00:02:54.490> line<00:02:54.700> ability<00:02:55.690> on

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
a excellent optical 700 line ability on

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.330 
a excellent optical 700 line ability on
this<00:02:55.959> camera<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.590> both<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:56.800> them<00:02:56.980> are<00:02:57.100> pretty

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
this camera so both of them are pretty

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.100 
this camera so both of them are pretty
cool<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.090> got<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> ten<00:02:58.510> times<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:58.959> those

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
cool so you got the ten times like those

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.900 
cool so you got the ten times like those
talking<00:02:59.709> about<00:02:59.860> when<00:02:59.980> we've<00:03:00.100> got<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.670> 30

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
talking about when we've got the the 30

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.640 
talking about when we've got the the 30
times<00:03:01.150> oome<00:03:01.330> right<00:03:01.540> here<00:03:01.720> which<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.320> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
times oome right here which is just a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.350 
times oome right here which is just a
little<00:03:02.980> bit<00:03:03.070> larger<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.640> case<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.270> only

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
little bit larger in the case it only

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.810 
little bit larger in the case it only
weighs<00:03:04.660> about<00:03:04.870> 30<00:03:05.560> 40<00:03:05.890> grams<00:03:06.100> more<00:03:06.400> than<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
weighs about 30 40 grams more than the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.670

10<00:03:07.030> times<00:03:07.240> zoom<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.720> little<00:03:08.080> bit<00:03:08.200> larger<00:03:08.470> case

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
10 times zoom a little bit larger case

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.140 
10 times zoom a little bit larger case
though<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.130> need<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.610> bit<00:03:09.790> larger

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
though so you need a little bit larger

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.670 
though so you need a little bit larger
gimbal<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.450> support<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.650> have

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
gimbal to support that but if you have

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.500 
gimbal to support that but if you have
an<00:03:11.890> fpv<00:03:12.430> application<00:03:13.090> where<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.360> have<00:03:13.390> a

the<00:03:35.620> market<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.070> are<00:03:36.190> helical<00:03:36.610> don't<00:03:36.940> have

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
the market that are helical don't have

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.970 
the market that are helical don't have
that<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.690> what<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.989> allows<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.769> is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
that and what that allows it to have is

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.650 
that and what that allows it to have is
a<00:03:39.010> little<00:03:39.190> bit<00:03:39.400> broader<00:03:39.670> beam<00:03:39.970> instead<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.450> so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
a little bit broader beam instead of so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020 
a little bit broader beam instead of so
being<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.170> narrow<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> as<00:03:41.709> well<00:03:41.950> really<00:03:42.730> nice<00:03:43.000> a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
being so narrow it as well really nice a

being so narrow it as well really nice a
support<00:03:43.690> structure<00:03:43.959> in<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
support structure in here for the the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.100 
support structure in here for the the
helix<00:03:45.459> itself<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.390> won't<00:03:46.570> get<00:03:46.750> deformed

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
helix itself so it won't get deformed

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.690 
helix itself so it won't get deformed
and<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.590> also<00:03:47.739> comes<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.340> little

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
and it also comes with this little

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.790 
and it also comes with this little
extension<00:03:48.970> which<00:03:49.660> allows<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.170> be<00:03:50.260> bent<00:03:50.590> and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
extension which allows it to be bent and

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.040 
extension which allows it to be bent and
used<00:03:51.070> as<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.550> 90<00:03:51.940> degree<00:03:52.269> or<00:03:52.300> or<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:52.900> you're

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
used as a 90 degree or or if you're

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.720 
used as a 90 degree or or if you're
gonna<00:03:53.140> use<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.920> pair<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.190> goggles<00:03:54.400> or

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
gonna use it on a pair of goggles or

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.530 
gonna use it on a pair of goggles or
something<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.150> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
something like that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.170 
something like that
fairly<00:03:56.260> inexpensive<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.370> comparison<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
fairly inexpensive in comparison to the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.030 
fairly inexpensive in comparison to the
other<00:03:58.300> ones<00:03:58.510> out<00:03:58.630> there<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.860> they

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
other ones out there and and they

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.650 
other ones out there and and they
actually<00:04:00.190> have<00:04:00.489> some<00:04:00.670> church<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.420> stuff

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
actually have some church and stuff

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.360 
actually have some church and stuff
where<00:04:01.840> they've<00:04:01.959> actually<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.709> can<00:04:02.890> prove<00:04:03.100> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
where they've actually it can prove the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.979 
where they've actually it can prove the
the<00:04:03.610> tuning<00:04:03.910> on<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.180> antenna<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.750> its

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
the tuning on this antenna and its

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.690 
the tuning on this antenna and its
effectiveness<00:04:05.380> now<00:04:06.100> granted<00:04:06.400> there's<00:04:06.640> a

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
effectiveness now granted there's a

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.160 
effectiveness now granted there's a
probably<00:04:07.120> much<00:04:07.330> better<00:04:07.360> antennas<00:04:08.019> on<00:04:08.140> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
probably much better antennas on the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.660 
probably much better antennas on the
market<00:04:08.530> but<00:04:08.709> for<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.950> price<00:04:09.190> range<00:04:09.459> it's

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
market but for the price range it's

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.430 
market but for the price range it's
definitely<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.120> heck<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.570> lot<00:04:10.660> better<00:04:10.930> than<00:04:11.019> a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
definitely a heck of a lot better than a

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.770 
definitely a heck of a lot better than a

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
lot of them that are out there for this

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.840 
lot of them that are out there for this

helical 's the other product that we're
introducing<00:04:19.060> from<00:04:19.510> on<00:04:19.750> way<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
introducing from on way is the

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.219 
introducing from on way is the
receiver<00:04:21.160> now<00:04:21.819> this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.389> 32<00:04:22.750> channel

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
receiver now this is a 32 channel

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.080 
receiver now this is a 32 channel
receiver<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.889> it's<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.460> one<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.639> was<00:04:24.819> actually

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
receiver and it's the one I was actually

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.700 
receiver and it's the one I was actually
using<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.509> here<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> video<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.530> really

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
using up here on the video it's really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.260 
using up here on the video it's really
nice<00:04:26.979> as<00:04:27.190> it's<00:04:27.460> got<00:04:27.610> its<00:04:27.729> band<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.150> this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
nice as it's got its band in this

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.089 
nice as it's got its band in this
channel<00:04:28.539> so<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.870> supports<00:04:29.020> all<00:04:29.349> 32<00:04:29.740> channels

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
channel so it supports all 32 channels

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.830 
channel so it supports all 32 channels
for<00:04:30.280> bands<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.819> eight<00:04:30.940> channels<00:04:31.330> per<00:04:31.569> chip

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
for bands and eight channels per chip

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260 
for bands and eight channels per chip

interesting<00:04:53.770> thing<00:04:54.460> about<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.270> has

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
interesting thing about this is it has

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.330 
interesting thing about this is it has
two<00:04:55.690> AV<00:04:55.900> outputs<00:04:56.470> which<00:04:56.680> are<00:04:56.800> normally<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.220> a

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
two AV outputs which are normally just a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.790 
two AV outputs which are normally just a
shared<00:04:57.610> output<00:04:58.000> just<00:04:58.930> splitter<00:04:59.259> and<00:04:59.380> boosted

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
shared output just splitter and boosted

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.180 
shared output just splitter and boosted
but<00:05:00.310> AV<00:05:00.610> one<00:05:00.910> is<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.690> output<00:05:01.840> via<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.470> DVR<00:05:02.949> so

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
but AV one is the output via the DVR so

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.980 
but AV one is the output via the DVR so
it's<00:05:03.310> being<00:05:03.430> processed<00:05:03.729> by<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.120> DVR<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.810> then

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
it's being processed by the DVR and then

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.390 
it's being processed by the DVR and then
that<00:05:05.259> is<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.590> output<00:05:05.710> out<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.099> there

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
that is the output out of there

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.180 
that is the output out of there
AV<00:05:07.120> 2<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.539> direct<00:05:08.080> signal<00:05:08.560> non<00:05:08.800> being

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
AV 2 is direct signal non being

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.760 
AV 2 is direct signal non being
processed<00:05:09.490> by<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:09.970> DVR<00:05:10.449> itself<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.320> one<00:05:11.560> might

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
processed by the DVR itself so one might

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.770 
processed by the DVR itself so one might
give<00:05:11.919> you<00:05:12.009> a<00:05:12.039> touch<00:05:12.580> of<00:05:12.610> latency<00:05:13.389> but<00:05:13.659> you're

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
give you a touch of latency but you're

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.230
