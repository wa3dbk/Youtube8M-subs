00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
a little bit about the the events that

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.440 
a little bit about the the events that
we<00:04:38.919> can<00:04:39.070> spot<00:04:39.280> specifically<00:04:39.820> for<00:04:40.090> today

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
we can spot specifically for today

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.470 
we can spot specifically for today
because<00:04:41.260> we<00:04:41.380> had<00:04:41.500> no<00:04:41.770> idea<00:04:42.220> on<00:04:42.580> how<00:04:43.120> stable

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
because we had no idea on how stable

this<00:04:43.780> build<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.140> going<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.410> be<00:04:44.560> we<00:04:44.919> decided

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
this build was going to be we decided

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.970 
this build was going to be we decided
against<00:04:45.850> doing<00:04:45.970> events<00:04:46.570> just<00:04:46.960> yet<00:04:47.200> however<00:04:47.410> I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
against doing events just yet however I

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030 
against doing events just yet however I
do<00:04:48.370> want<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.730> show<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.000> guys<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.690> low<00:04:50.410> there<00:04:50.830> it

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
do want to show you guys a low there it

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.210 
do want to show you guys a low there it
is<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.640> that's<00:04:52.050> certainly<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.440> app<00:04:53.710> that's

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
is so that's certainly that app that's

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220 
is so that's certainly that app that's
gonna<00:04:54.430> be<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.760> end<00:04:54.970> of<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.510> okay<00:04:56.169> so

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
gonna be the end of that okay so

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.800 
gonna be the end of that okay so
apparently<00:04:56.919> we're<00:04:57.730> gonna<00:04:57.880> call<00:04:58.180> it<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.570> end

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
apparently we're gonna call it the end

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.380 
apparently we're gonna call it the end
right<00:04:59.200> there<00:04:59.230> but<00:04:59.650> before<00:04:59.980> we<00:05:00.130> go<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.669> do<00:05:01.150> want

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390

to show you something and let's turn on
the<00:05:04.540> camera<00:05:05.850> for<00:05:06.850> next<00:05:07.120> time<00:05:07.300> when<00:05:07.750> our<00:05:07.780> build

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
the camera for next time when our build

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.110 
the camera for next time when our build
is<00:05:08.380> going<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.620> be<00:05:08.710> significantly<00:05:08.919> more<00:05:09.520> stable

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
is going to be significantly more stable

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.430 
is going to be significantly more stable
we<00:05:10.930> have<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.230> following<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:13.210> see<00:05:13.419> that<00:05:13.630> that

lying<00:06:10.660> give<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.290> better<00:06:11.470> performance<00:06:11.890> next

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
lying give a better performance next

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.710 
lying give a better performance next
time<00:06:12.400> because<00:06:12.580> once<00:06:12.850> again<00:06:12.970> Charlemagne<00:06:13.570> is
