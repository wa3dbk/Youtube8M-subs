deathmatch node which you actually have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.929 
deathmatch node which you actually have
to<00:01:03.420> destroy<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> nodes<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.860> capture<00:01:05.760> them

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to destroy the nodes to capture them

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
to destroy the nodes to capture them
when<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> capture<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> node<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> note

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
when you capture a node you get the note

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
when you capture a node you get the note
and<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.659> logo<00:01:10.080> pops<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.590> inside<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and your little logo pops up inside the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
and your little logo pops up inside the
node<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:12.630> teams<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.409> other<00:01:13.619> clans<00:01:14.040> can

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
node and other teams or other clans can

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
node and other teams or other clans can
actually<00:01:14.729> attack<00:01:15.030> them<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.450> depending<00:01:16.229> on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
actually attack them and depending on

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
actually attack them and depending on
how<00:01:16.500> many<00:01:16.560> active<00:01:17.130> players<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.909> which

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
how many active players they have which

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.039 
how many active players they have which
takes<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> many<00:01:20.189> wins<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.210> destroy<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.810> node

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
takes so many wins to destroy your node

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
takes so many wins to destroy your node
so<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.619> 15<00:01:23.280> players<00:01:23.580> playing<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so if there's 15 players playing that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
so if there's 15 players playing that
game<00:01:24.450> mode<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.350> took<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:26.040> will

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
game mode that you just took they will

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.940 
game mode that you just took they will
be<00:01:26.220> taking<00:01:26.580> 15<00:01:27.030> points<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> match<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.290> cubed<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
be taking 15 points a match so cubed of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
be taking 15 points a match so cubed of
leave<00:01:29.159> they're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.670> taken<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
leave they're going to be taken a lot of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
leave they're going to be taken a lot of
points<00:01:31.650> off<00:01:31.799> very<00:01:32.159> fast<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.729> they're<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> very

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
points off very fast if they're a very

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
points off very fast if they're a very
active<00:01:33.390> clan<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.470> potentially<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.490> more

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
active clan so potentially the more

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
active clan so potentially the more
active<00:01:35.820> people<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> easier<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
active people you have the easier it is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.850 
active people you have the easier it is
to<00:01:37.350> win<00:01:37.619> clan<00:01:37.860> worse<00:01:39.229> but<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> best

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to win clan worse but one of the best

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
to win clan worse but one of the best
things<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.579> nodes<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
things about these nodes is you can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780 
things about these nodes is you can
actually<00:01:42.659> keep<00:01:43.320> playing<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> game<00:01:43.890> mode<00:01:44.280> once

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
actually keep playing the game mode once

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually keep playing the game mode once
you've<00:01:45.000> captured<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> node<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you've captured the node and you can

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
you've captured the node and you can
defend<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:47.579> keep<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.030> players

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569

the active clan so that's basically

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
to aim for this is pretty much

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.030 
to aim for this is pretty much
self-explanatory<00:05:24.630> I'm<00:05:25.320> going<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.530> move<00:05:25.680> on<00:05:25.860> to

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
prior to that event there will be a

prior to that event there will be a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
roster lock and what this does it locks

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.500 
roster lock and what this does it locks
you<00:05:39.780> in<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.860> bracket<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.970> can't<00:05:42.300> add

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
you in that bracket and you can't add

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.719 
you in that bracket and you can't add
any<00:05:42.690> more<00:05:42.750> members<00:05:43.200> actually<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:44.490> add

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
any more members actually you can add

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.510 
any more members actually you can add
members<00:05:45.060> but<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:46.320> goes<00:05:46.530> by<00:05:46.710> total<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:47.370> you

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
members but it goes by total so if you

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.060 
members but it goes by total so if you
had<00:05:47.970> 40<00:05:48.600> members<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.500> added<00:05:49.680> five<00:05:50.040> more

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
had 40 members and you added five more

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.130 
had 40 members and you added five more
members<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.820> would<00:05:50.940> up<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.450> next<00:05:51.660> bracket

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
members you would up to the next bracket

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.070 
members you would up to the next bracket
and<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:53.040> actually<00:05:53.430> would<00:05:53.550> have<00:05:53.720> 45<00:05:54.720> of<00:05:54.960> those

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
and you actually would have 45 of those

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.230 
and you actually would have 45 of those
members<00:05:55.560> whoever<00:05:55.860> plays<00:05:56.220> first<00:05:56.669> actually

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
members whoever plays first actually

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.760 
members whoever plays first actually
gets<00:05:57.390> locked<00:05:57.690> in<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.140> doesn't<00:05:58.440> matter<00:05:58.530> how

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
gets locked in it doesn't matter how

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.770 
gets locked in it doesn't matter how
many<00:05:58.800> members<00:05:59.160> you<00:05:59.400> have<00:05:59.580> it's<00:05:59.850> the<00:06:00.210> first<00:06:00.390> 45

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
many members you have it's the first 45

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.469 
many members you have it's the first 45
that<00:06:01.140> get<00:06:01.260> locked<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.400> that's<00:06:02.550> how<00:06:02.669> roster

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
that get locked in so that's how roster

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.270 
that get locked in so that's how roster
lock<00:06:03.660> works<00:06:03.900> so<00:06:04.229> if<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.530> add<00:06:04.680> more<00:06:04.919> members

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
lock works so if you add more members

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.420 
lock works so if you add more members
guys<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:06.350> that<00:06:07.350> potentially<00:06:07.860> screws<00:06:08.280> you

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
guys and that potentially screws you

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.540 
guys and that potentially screws you
over<00:06:08.460> from<00:06:09.390> your<00:06:09.540> veteran<00:06:09.930> players<00:06:10.169> that

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
over from your veteran players that

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.530 
over from your veteran players that
potentially<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:11.669> better<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.120> we'll<00:06:12.240> get<00:06:12.390> more

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
potentially is better and we'll get more

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.820 
potentially is better and we'll get more
wins<00:06:12.810> so<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.169> got<00:06:13.290> to<00:06:13.380> look<00:06:13.470> out<00:06:13.620> for<00:06:13.680> that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
wins so you got to look out for that

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.620 
wins so you got to look out for that
that's<00:06:14.310> everything<00:06:14.520> about<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.060> rock<00:06:15.300> well

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
that's everything about the rock well

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.570 
that's everything about the rock well
pretty<00:06:15.870> much<00:06:16.050> for<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.410> roster<00:06:16.800> lock<00:06:16.979> just

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
pretty much for the roster lock just

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.830 
pretty much for the roster lock just
look<00:06:17.760> out<00:06:17.880> for<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.300> that's<00:06:18.510> pretty<00:06:18.750> much

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
look out for it that's pretty much

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.570 
look out for it that's pretty much
everything<00:06:19.080> for<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.680> I'm<00:06:19.979> going<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.250> move<00:06:20.370> on

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
everything for it I'm going to move on

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.920 
everything for it I'm going to move on
to<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.850> notes<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:21.270> how<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.450> clan<00:06:21.750> wars

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
to the notes and how the clan wars

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.010 
to the notes and how the clan wars
actually<00:06:22.320> works<00:06:23.000> for<00:06:24.000> diamond<00:06:24.300> division<00:06:24.630> up

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
actually works for diamond division up

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.659 
actually works for diamond division up
next<00:06:25.470> guys<00:06:25.590> you'll<00:06:25.830> actually<00:06:26.010> notice<00:06:26.340> that

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
next guys you'll actually notice that

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.670 
next guys you'll actually notice that
the<00:06:26.820> diamond<00:06:27.450> division<00:06:27.810> clan<00:06:27.990> wars<00:06:28.200> map<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.650> a

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
the diamond division clan wars map is a

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.380 
the diamond division clan wars map is a
little<00:06:29.010> bit<00:06:29.130> different<00:06:29.460> as<00:06:29.580> a<00:06:29.610> blue<00:06:29.880> tint<00:06:30.150> to

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
little bit different as a blue tint to

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.000 
little bit different as a blue tint to
it<00:06:30.419> and<00:06:30.660> there's<00:06:31.350> a<00:06:31.410> little<00:06:31.590> bit<00:06:31.800> of<00:06:31.860> a

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
it and there's a little bit of a

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.120 
it and there's a little bit of a
difference<00:06:32.430> there's<00:06:32.729> actually<00:06:33.300> a

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
difference there's actually a

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.950 
difference there's actually a
computerized<00:06:35.130> plan<00:06:35.940> that<00:06:36.360> plays<00:06:36.630> against

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
computerized plan that plays against

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.839 
computerized plan that plays against
seven<00:06:37.320> other<00:06:37.440> clans<00:06:37.890> and<00:06:38.130> they<00:06:38.280> actually<00:06:38.700> have

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
seven other clans and they actually have

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.850 
seven other clans and they actually have
the<00:06:39.000> nodes<00:06:39.210> at<00:06:39.390> the<00:06:39.479> beginning<00:06:39.960> and<00:06:40.110> every<00:06:40.680> day

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
the nodes at the beginning and every day

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.420 
the nodes at the beginning and every day
at<00:06:40.979> recess

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
at recess

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.630 
at recess
so<00:06:41.760> if<00:06:42.030> one<00:06:42.930> clan<00:06:43.350> actually<00:06:43.950> takes<00:06:44.160> two<00:06:44.370> notes

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
so if one clan actually takes two notes

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.460 
so if one clan actually takes two notes
that<00:06:45.060> resets<00:06:45.510> and<00:06:45.600> it<00:06:45.750> gives<00:06:45.900> you<00:06:45.990> a<00:06:46.020> chance<00:06:46.110> to

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
that resets and it gives you a chance to

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.530 
that resets and it gives you a chance to
take<00:06:46.620> those<00:06:46.830> notes<00:06:47.160> but<00:06:47.700> you<00:06:47.850> only<00:06:47.970> have<00:06:48.090> four
