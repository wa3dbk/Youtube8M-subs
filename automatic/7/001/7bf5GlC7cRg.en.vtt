00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
took my best shot of recreating that in

took my best shot of recreating that in
Minecraft<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.800> we'll<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:10.950> taking<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.250> look<00:00:11.280> at

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Minecraft so we'll be taking a look at

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.950 
Minecraft so we'll be taking a look at
that<00:00:11.519> today<00:00:11.910> you'll<00:00:12.420> see<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:12.809> these

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that today you'll see I have these

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.480 
that today you'll see I have these
planks<00:00:13.259> set<00:00:13.530> up<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.740> burn<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> me<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.400> be

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
planks set up and burn to me this can be

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
planks set up and burn to me this can be
done<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.849> any<00:00:14.940> block<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.630> want<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.440> pretty

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
done with any block you want it's pretty

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
done with any block you want it's pretty
simple<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> matter<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> changing

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
simple it's just a matter of changing

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
simple it's just a matter of changing
the<00:00:18.420> ID<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> command<00:00:19.260> block<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.160> what

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the ID in the command block but what

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.849 
the ID in the command block but what
happens<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.960> spawn<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.350> these<00:00:22.500> zombies

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
happens is we spawn in these zombies

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
happens is we spawn in these zombies
gonna<00:00:23.609> spawn<00:00:23.850> ton<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> speed<00:00:25.019> up

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
gonna spawn ton of them just to speed up

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
gonna spawn ton of them just to speed up
the<00:00:25.230> process<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.800> then<00:00:26.279> we'll<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.670> run

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the process and then we'll all just run

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
the process and then we'll all just run
over<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.300> blocks<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> start<00:00:28.320> attacking

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
over to these blocks and start attacking

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.490 
over to these blocks and start attacking
them<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> move<00:00:30.330> across<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.960> attack

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
them so I kind of move across to attack

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.930 
them so I kind of move across to attack
different<00:00:31.890> blocks<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
different blocks or what have you and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
different blocks or what have you and
eventually<00:00:33.950> um<00:00:34.950> you'll<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.090> happens<00:00:36.420> i

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
eventually um you'll see what happens i

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.910 
eventually um you'll see what happens i
spawned<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.079> few<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> speeds<00:00:37.800> up

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
spawned a good few in so it speeds up

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.850 
spawned a good few in so it speeds up
the<00:00:38.040> process<00:00:38.660> there<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.469> ball<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.739> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
shop and you want to press that button
perras<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.119> repeater<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.200> planks

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
perras that repeater to and the planks

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
perras that repeater to and the planks
are<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.880> into<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> part<00:01:33.479> here

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
are back so we go into this part here

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
are back so we go into this part here
this<00:01:34.079> looks<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.070> complicated<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
this looks a bit more complicated but it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.660 
this looks a bit more complicated but it
could<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.659> simplified<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.670> I'll

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
could be really simplified down I'll

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.100 
could be really simplified down I'll
probably<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> design<00:01:40.079> because

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
probably just use this design because

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
probably just use this design because
it's<00:01:40.470> much<00:01:40.619> easier<00:01:40.650> though<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.670> starts

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's much easier though so it starts

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
it's much easier though so it starts
with<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.210> clock<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.840> clock<00:01:43.020> comes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with this clock here this clock comes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
with this clock here this clock comes
around<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> places<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> redstone

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
around this and places that redstone

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.260 
around this and places that redstone
block<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.920> place<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.159> fills<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> air

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
block and also place it fills up the air

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.260 
block and also place it fills up the air
the<00:01:48.810> reason<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.170> using<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.740> come<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.579> command

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the reason I'm using to come to command

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.859 
the reason I'm using to come to command
blocks<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:53.659> i'm<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
blocks like this and i'm not just

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
blocks like this and i'm not just
feeding<00:01:55.200> into<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.710> command<00:01:56.009> block<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
feeding into this one command block is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
feeding into this one command block is
because<00:01:56.909> i'm<00:01:57.000> gonna<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> change<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
because i'm gonna have to change this to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.840 
because i'm gonna have to change this to
where<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.860> second<00:01:59.340> number<00:01:59.610> actually

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
where this second number actually

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
where this second number actually
extends<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.930> need<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> row

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
extends because we're gonna need a row

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.260 
extends because we're gonna need a row
about<00:02:01.649> six<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.219> these<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> same<00:02:02.790> time<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
about six of these at the same time and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
about six of these at the same time and
using<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> regular<00:02:04.350> clock<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.829> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
using just a regular clock like this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.260 
using just a regular clock like this
wouldn't<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.549> most<00:02:05.759> efficient<00:02:06.149> way<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
wouldn't be the most efficient way of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.680 
wouldn't be the most efficient way of
doing<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.710> run<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.849> lot<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
doing that so so we can run a lot of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
doing that so so we can run a lot of
redstone<00:02:09.959> off<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.590> clock<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.430> i<00:02:11.489> didn't<00:02:11.700> want

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
redstone off one clock so i didn't want

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.240 
redstone off one clock so i didn't want
to<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.030> designate<00:02:12.750> clocks

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to just designate clocks

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.460 
to just designate clocks
you<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.820> different<00:02:14.150> components<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.930> so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you do different components of it so

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.710 
you do different components of it so
this<00:02:16.250> tests<00:02:16.610> for<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.790> villager<00:02:17.150> over<00:02:17.510> there

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
this tests for the villager over there

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.390 
this tests for the villager over there
test<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.530> exact<00:02:18.740> coordinates<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
test out the exact coordinates with a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.030 
test out the exact coordinates with a
radius<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.940> 5<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.840> could<00:02:21.230> lower<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.770> two<00:02:21.920> or

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
radius of 5 I could lower that to two or

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
radius of 5 I could lower that to two or
three<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:23.480> wouldn't<00:02:23.810> work<00:02:23.930> because<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
three but it wouldn't work because I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.440 
three but it wouldn't work because I
needed<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.800> spread<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.430> whole<00:02:25.610> way<00:02:25.730> across<00:02:25.880> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
needed to spread the whole way across to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.960 
needed to spread the whole way across to
here<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.770> villager<00:02:28.100> actually<00:02:28.430> spawns<00:02:28.670> you

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
here so the villager actually spawns you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.270 
here so the villager actually spawns you
can<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.630> villager<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.140> spawned<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.860> don't

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
can see the villager is spawned I don't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.770 
can see the villager is spawned I don't
know<00:02:31.340> why<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.240> planks<00:02:32.660> are

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
know why that is because the planks are

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.480 
know why that is because the planks are
here<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:33.709> we'll<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.130> ahead<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.340> kill

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
here but we'll just go ahead and kill

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.720 
here but we'll just go ahead and kill
him<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.150> particles<00:02:35.600> go<00:02:35.840> off<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.280> need<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
him the particles go off but we need to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.970 
him the particles go off but we need to
reach<00:02:37.880> 1<00:02:38.150> 2<00:02:38.420> 3<00:02:38.450> 4<00:02:38.810> I'm<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.590> be<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.860> safe

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
reach 1 2 3 4 I'm just be on the safe

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.800 
reach 1 2 3 4 I'm just be on the safe
side<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.190> put<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.490> here<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.880> also<00:02:41.390> reached<00:02:41.630> over

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
side I put it here and also reached over

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.370 
side I put it here and also reached over
here<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:43.760> go<00:02:43.880> back<00:02:43.910> here<00:02:44.330> once<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.080> test

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
here so we go back here once that test

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.850 
here so we go back here once that test
is<00:02:45.530> successful<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.580> d<00:02:46.910> powers<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.690> torch<00:02:48.590> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
is successful it d powers this torch so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.170 
is successful it d powers this torch so
if<00:02:48.920> we<00:02:49.010> go<00:02:49.130> ahead<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.370> we<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.730> someone<00:02:50.090> in

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
if we go ahead and we just someone in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.449 
if we go ahead and we just someone in
the<00:02:50.360> villager<00:02:51.230> again<00:02:51.410> you'll<00:02:52.010> see<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the villager again you'll see that the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.430 
the villager again you'll see that the
torch<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.209> powered<00:02:53.690> now<00:02:53.840> which<00:02:54.290> means

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
torch is not powered now which means

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.870 
torch is not powered now which means
these<00:02:54.709> command<00:02:55.010> blocks<00:02:55.190> are<00:02:55.340> not<00:02:55.520> getting<00:02:55.760> any

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
these command blocks are not getting any

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.820 
these command blocks are not getting any
signal<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.810> one<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:57.350> causes<00:02:57.530> the

signal this one is what causes the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
play for pretty simple and then this one

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.140 
play for pretty simple and then this one
just<00:03:05.959> fills<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.730> planks<00:03:07.730> over<00:03:07.880> there<00:03:08.030> with

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
just fills the planks over there with

just fills the planks over there with
air<00:03:08.360> which<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.110> again<00:03:09.440> extremely<00:03:09.860> easy<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.340> do

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
air which is again extremely easy to do

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.240 
air which is again extremely easy to do
it's<00:03:10.910> just<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.360> fill<00:03:11.540> command<00:03:11.860> which<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.040> quite

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's just a fill command which is quite

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.370 
it's just a fill command which is quite
simple<00:03:13.640> quite<00:03:14.150> easy<00:03:14.450> quite<00:03:14.840> straightforward

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
simple quite easy quite straightforward

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.680 
simple quite easy quite straightforward
so<00:03:15.920> I'm<00:03:16.370> going<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.880> be<00:03:17.000> using<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.450> for<00:03:17.630> a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
so I'm going to be using this for a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.020 
so I'm going to be using this for a
project<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.440> have<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.739> mind<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.910> going

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
project that I have in mind it's going

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.789 
project that I have in mind it's going
to<00:03:20.060> take<00:03:20.239> me<00:03:20.360> quite<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.630> while<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.440> so

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
to take me quite a while to do it so

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.800 
to take me quite a while to do it so
probably<00:03:22.730> isn't<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:22.970> good<00:03:23.060> idea<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.420> expect<00:03:23.690> in

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
probably isn't a good idea to expect in

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.150 
probably isn't a good idea to expect in
the<00:03:23.959> next<00:03:23.989> couple<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.350> weeks<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.799> on<00:03:25.010> this
