00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
course like every hat would have is a

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.580 
course like every hat would have is a
plastic<00:02:43.099> insert<00:02:43.519> which<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.900> very<00:02:45.140> stiff

plastic insert which is very very stiff

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.009 
plastic insert which is very very stiff
and<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:48.410> needles<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.730> machine<00:02:50.019> well

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
and the needles on this machine well

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.570 
and the needles on this machine well
this<00:02:51.170> machine<00:02:51.560> itself<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.950> strong<00:02:52.250> enough<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
this machine itself is strong enough to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.259 
this machine itself is strong enough to
go<00:02:52.730> through<00:02:52.760> it

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
go through it

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.539 
go through it
although<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.080> needles<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.709> came<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
although the needles that came with it I

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.820 
although the needles that came with it I
broke<00:02:55.910> both<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.390> them<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.319> had<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.680> upgrade

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
broke both of them so I had to upgrade

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.430 
broke both of them so I had to upgrade
the<00:02:58.190> stronger<00:02:58.580> needles<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.630> size<00:02:59.900> 16

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
the stronger needles this is a size 16

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.050 
the stronger needles this is a size 16
which<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.769> probably<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.459> little<00:03:01.549> bit<00:03:01.730> too<00:03:01.760> big

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
which is probably a little bit too big

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.449 
which is probably a little bit too big
for<00:03:02.180> me<00:03:02.269> right<00:03:02.420> now<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:03.260> um<00:03:03.440> for<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
for me right now but um for the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.920 
for me right now but um for the
applications<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.239> needed<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> make<00:03:05.660> sure<00:03:05.690> that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
applications I needed to make sure that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.240 
applications I needed to make sure that
my<00:03:06.080> machine<00:03:06.230> was<00:03:06.560> strong<00:03:06.799> enough<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.040> go

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
my machine was strong enough to go

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.210 
my machine was strong enough to go
through<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:08.000> bill<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.420> hat<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:08.900> also<00:03:09.560> make

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
through the bill of a hat and also make

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.070 
through the bill of a hat and also make
repeated<00:03:10.519> holes<00:03:10.849> in<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.120> as<00:03:11.209> well<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.599> this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
repeated holes in it as well so this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.350 
repeated holes in it as well so this
machine<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.500> very<00:03:12.530> helpful<00:03:12.860> with<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.519> my

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
machine is very helpful with that and my

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.699 
machine is very helpful with that and my
thing<00:03:14.569> is<00:03:14.690> since<00:03:14.870> I'm<00:03:14.959> very<00:03:15.230> very<00:03:15.440> new<00:03:15.560> to

how<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.880> make<00:03:28.880> sure<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:30.410> knob<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.739> at<00:03:30.829> its

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
how I make sure that this knob is at its

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.979 
how I make sure that this knob is at its
lowest<00:03:31.069> setting<00:03:31.400> you're<00:03:32.150> able<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.480> control

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
lowest setting you're able to control

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.710 
lowest setting you're able to control
the<00:03:33.170> setting<00:03:33.560> by<00:03:34.459> turning<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.910> knob<00:03:35.120> that'll

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
the setting by turning the knob that'll

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.990 
the setting by turning the knob that'll
be<00:03:35.810> as<00:03:35.930> fast<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.319> it<00:03:36.410> goes

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
be as fast as it goes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.229 
be as fast as it goes
so<00:03:38.000> right<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.329> it's<00:03:38.510> had<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.630> lowest<00:03:39.470> speed<00:03:39.739> and

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
so right now it's had a lowest speed and

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.520 
so right now it's had a lowest speed and
to<00:03:41.239> an<00:03:41.359> extent<00:03:41.450> you're<00:03:41.750> able<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.019> control<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
to an extent you're able to control the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.309 
to an extent you're able to control the
speed<00:03:42.799> with<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.700> pedal<00:03:44.150> but<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.170> show

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
speed with the pedal but just to show

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.170 
speed with the pedal but just to show
you<00:03:45.380> how<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.709> is<00:03:45.829> okay<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.940> going<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.120> be

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you how it is okay this is going to be

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.570 
you how it is okay this is going to be
the<00:03:50.269> slow<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.600> you're<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.840> go<00:03:50.959> for<00:03:51.319> it

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.660 

now<00:04:00.580> that's<00:04:00.819> really<00:04:01.209> slow<00:04:02.160> but<00:04:03.160> if<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.370> press<00:04:03.640> a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
now that's really slow but if I press a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.059 
now that's really slow but if I press a
foot<00:04:03.970> all<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.360> way<00:04:04.480> down<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.989> its<00:04:05.650> slowest

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
foot all the way down and its slowest

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.390 
foot all the way down and its slowest
setting<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.790> office<00:04:07.180> it'll<00:04:07.450> go

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.970 

which<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.550> pretty<00:04:12.730> decent<00:04:12.970> speed

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
which is a pretty decent speed

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.129 
which is a pretty decent speed
especially<00:04:14.980> if<00:04:15.069> you're<00:04:15.250> beginner<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:17.109> I

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
especially if you're beginner and here I

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.580 
especially if you're beginner and here I
have<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.560> set<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.919> at<00:04:18.700> five<00:04:19.410> millimeters<00:04:20.410> or

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
have it set it at five millimeters or

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.100 
have it set it at five millimeters or
centimeters<00:04:20.620> stitch<00:04:21.400> length<00:04:21.669> whatever<00:04:22.110> unit

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
centimeters stitch length whatever unit

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.659 
centimeters stitch length whatever unit
of<00:04:23.229> measurement<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.160> I'm<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.610> to

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
of measurement it is and I'm going to

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.640 
of measurement it is and I'm going to
show<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.880> at<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.270> highest<00:04:25.510> speed<00:04:25.960> where<00:04:26.380> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
show you at this highest speed where it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.940 
show you at this highest speed where it
gets<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:26.979> crazy<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.860> the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
gets really crazy now this is the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.080 
gets really crazy now this is the
highest<00:04:30.130> speed<00:04:30.340> it'll<00:04:30.610> draw<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:36.760> can<00:04:36.880> see<00:04:37.060> I

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
highest speed it'll draw you can see I

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.450 
highest speed it'll draw you can see I
changed<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.720> stitch<00:04:37.960> length<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.530> at<00:04:39.340> the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
changed the stitch length and at the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.490 
changed the stitch length and at the
high<00:04:39.639> speeds<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.810> stitches<00:04:41.200> are<00:04:41.320> pretty

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
high speeds the stitches are pretty

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.990 
high speeds the stitches are pretty
clean<00:04:42.780> yeah<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.080> mean<00:04:44.280> if<00:04:45.280> you're<00:04:45.669> worrying

you know worry about the speed of
everything<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.360> being<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.690> beginner<00:04:52.990> it

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
have to worry about that as long as you

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.270 
have to worry about that as long as you
get<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> servomotor<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.220> everything<00:04:57.700> um
