00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
game in this unique case you know how

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
game in this unique case you know how
the<00:02:02.670> game<00:02:02.759> usually<00:02:03.060> comes<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.509> those<00:02:03.799> plastic

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the game usually comes in those plastic

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.370 
the game usually comes in those plastic
like<00:02:05.009> those<00:02:05.280> clear<00:02:05.640> games<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> paper

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
like those clear games with the paper

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.309 
like those clear games with the paper
that<00:02:07.530> show<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> cover<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.080> different

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that show the cover this is different

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.650 
that show the cover this is different
this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.860> holographic<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.910> aluminum

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
this is like holographic like aluminum

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
this is like holographic like aluminum
very<00:02:13.260> cool<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:15.630> has<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.410> holographic<00:02:17.010> stuff

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
very cool it has like holographic stuff

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.330 
very cool it has like holographic stuff
on<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.870> very<00:02:18.870> cool<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.410> collectors<00:02:19.890> nate<00:02:20.190> I'm

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
on it very cool to collectors nate I'm

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.880 
on it very cool to collectors nate I'm
sure<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> let's<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.050> what's<00:02:22.200> inside<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
sure so let's see what's inside here you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.680 
sure so let's see what's inside here you
the<00:02:23.100> black<00:02:23.280> ops<00:02:23.580> disk<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:26.510> don't<00:02:27.510> need<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the black ops disk and I don't need to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.850 
the black ops disk and I don't need to
take<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> salmon<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.350> doing<00:02:30.470> background<00:02:31.470> so

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
take the salmon are doing background so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.780 
take the salmon are doing background so
show<00:02:32.130> guy<00:02:32.310> I'm<00:02:32.460> 16<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.210> then<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.290> paper

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
show guy I'm 16 and then this paper

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
show guy I'm 16 and then this paper
right<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.030> shows<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:37.380> comes<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
games so let's close this let's move on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.380 
games so let's close this let's move on
to<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> second<00:02:46.860> thing<00:02:47.070> inside<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> box<00:02:47.700> this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
to the second thing inside the box this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.770 
to the second thing inside the box this
is<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.780> metal<00:02:49.520> it's<00:02:50.520> black<00:02:50.850> ops<00:02:51.090> metal<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
is the metal it's black ops metal it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.700 
is the metal it's black ops metal it
will<00:02:51.900> attach<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.470> chest<00:02:53.310> open<00:02:54.180> this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:07.730 

to<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.770> Pando<00:02:59.250> last<00:03:00.150> time<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.990> comes<00:03:07.290> with

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
to the Pando last time it comes with

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.310 
to the Pando last time it comes with
chrome<00:03:08.700> casing<00:03:10.070> very<00:03:11.070> nicely<00:03:11.790> packaged<00:03:12.540> you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
chrome casing very nicely packaged you

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.920 
chrome casing very nicely packaged you
have<00:03:13.500> apple<00:03:14.430> things<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:15.030> things<00:03:15.600> made<00:03:15.900> by

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
have apple things like things made by

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.410 
have apple things like things made by
apple<00:03:16.500> or<00:03:17.490> I<00:03:17.580> mean<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.000> mean<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.360> really

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.230 
apple or I mean when I mean like really
professionally<00:03:19.410> packaged<00:03:19.860> okay<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:20.970> go

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.930 

here's<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.680> case<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.860> comes<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
here's the case it comes in like a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.730 
here's the case it comes in like a
plaque<00:03:27.330> sort<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.780> thing<00:03:27.930> called<00:03:28.230> duty<00:03:28.500> black

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
plaque sort of thing called duty black

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.470 
plaque sort of thing called duty black
ops<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.390> box<00:03:30.720> for<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:32.480> yeah

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
ops and then this is the box for it yeah
