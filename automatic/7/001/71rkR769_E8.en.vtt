just<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.030> make<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.479> know<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.229> you

so easy way to clear this up you're
going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.659> racer<00:01:55.020> tool<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
going to go to a little racer tool and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
going to go to a little racer tool and
make<00:01:55.619> sure<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> fuzzy<00:01:56.520> brush

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
make sure that's on the fuzzy brush

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.870 
make sure that's on the fuzzy brush
which<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> already<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.579> it's<00:01:59.579> kind

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
which I already have it on and it's kind

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.899 
which I already have it on and it's kind
of<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.060> race<00:02:00.450> around<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.380> layer<00:02:01.909> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
of you know race around the layer to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.960 
of you know race around the layer to
make<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> look<00:02:03.270> natural

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:18.510 

and<00:02:09.780> almost<00:02:10.780> done<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> go

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and almost done there you go

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.030 
and almost done there you go
and<00:02:18.940> then<00:02:19.690> again<00:02:20.110> if<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.440> want<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.890> little

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and then again if you want it a little

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.100 
and then again if you want it a little
longer<00:02:21.640> which<00:02:21.940> I'm<00:02:22.180> thinking<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.810> want<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
longer which I'm thinking I want a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.020 
longer which I'm thinking I want a
little<00:02:23.290> longer<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.310> know<00:02:24.430> redo<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
little longer just you know redo the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.940 
little longer just you know redo the
scale<00:02:25.300> tool<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.860> drag<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.890> down<00:02:27.450> press<00:02:28.450> scale

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
scale tool and drag it down press scale

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.170 
scale tool and drag it down press scale
and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:32.160> continue<00:02:33.160> touch<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> size<00:02:33.940> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and then continue touch up the size of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.710 
and then continue touch up the size of
the<00:02:34.270> residual<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.240> was<00:02:37.420> pretty

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the residual so I think that was pretty

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.650 
the residual so I think that was pretty
simple<00:02:38.550> after<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.910> you're<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.570> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
simple after that you're just going to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.520 
simple after that you're just going to
get<00:02:40.780> rid<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.340> rid<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.270> have<00:02:44.020> selected

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
get rid a rid of what you have selected

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.310 
get rid a rid of what you have selected
just<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.640> know<00:02:46.830> voila<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.910> lot<00:02:49.150> longer<00:02:49.390> so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
just you know voila it's a lot longer so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.510 
just you know voila it's a lot longer so
then<00:02:50.470> you're<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.770> going<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.040> repeat<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
then you're just going to repeat the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.890 
then you're just going to repeat the
same<00:02:51.790> step<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.570> other<00:02:52.720> side<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:54.090> um<00:02:55.090> use

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
same step to the other side and um use

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.710 
same step to the other side and um use

you're going to use a scale tool again

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.180 
you're going to use a scale tool again
which<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.820> again<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.360> fourth<00:03:16.630> one<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.320> the
