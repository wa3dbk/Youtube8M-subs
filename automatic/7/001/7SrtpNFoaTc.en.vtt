 "Gerson's Cancer Therapy" 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.540
 A number of recent documents have renewed interest in Gerson therapy. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.020
 It is predominantly a nutritionally alternative cancer treatment 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.860
 invented by the late dr. Max Gerson 80 years ago. 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.910
 According to a recent report by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Oncology 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.010
 you can fly to a clinic in Mexico for about $ 16,000 and spend it 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.570
 there three weeks of eating "fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices." 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 Well, why not. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 "You will exclude salt from the diet." 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.070
 No problem yet. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.710
 And you will "use dietary supplements such as potassium, vitamin B12, 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.969
 thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes, "and allegedly" detoxify the liver 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.120
 using an enema that promotes metabolism. " 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 I have no doubt that coffee enemas are encouraging, 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.340
 but I wouldn't recommend them because we have information that they can kill. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.670
 Modern operators of Gerson Therapy have my appreciation 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 for having dropped some of the original ones 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.390
 such as the administration of blended raw veal liver. 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.780
 Many people have died of systemic blood infections because of this. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.490
 After finding out the outbreak, the Gerson Institute staff decided that they should change 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 rules and instead of drinks from blended raw liver 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 they injected them into patients. 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.840
 However, even conventional cancer treatment is not a walk through the rose garden, is it? 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 You are taking her in the hope of helping you. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.380
 So how does Gerson's therapy lead her? 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.270
 The first official study of treatment was already in 1947, 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.650
 about 65 years have passed and over ten studies have been created, 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.880
 which are published in the scientific literature. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.249
 And most of them came to the same conclusion: 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.479
 Gerson therapy is ineffective, possibly harmful. 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.780
 In tomorrow's video, I'll present some of the available research.
