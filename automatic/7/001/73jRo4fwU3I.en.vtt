like<00:00:04.580> taking<00:00:05.000> the<00:00:05.120> basics<00:00:05.630> of<00:00:05.780> a<00:00:05.900> blink<00:00:06.200> the

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
like taking the basics of a blink the

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.139 
like taking the basics of a blink the
basic<00:00:06.710> timings<00:00:07.130> of<00:00:07.279> it<00:00:07.430> and<00:00:07.610> then<00:00:07.790> little

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
basic timings of it and then little

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.450 
basic timings of it and then little
things<00:00:08.390> you<00:00:08.540> can<00:00:08.720> do<00:00:08.930> little<00:00:09.560> nuances<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:10.310> can

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
things you can do little nuances you can

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.880 
things you can do little nuances you can
add<00:00:10.670> on<00:00:10.880> later<00:00:11.180> to<00:00:11.960> make<00:00:12.440> it<00:00:12.560> feel<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.770> little

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
add on later to make it feel a little

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.820 
add on later to make it feel a little
bit<00:00:13.010> more<00:00:13.220> organic<00:00:13.960> here<00:00:14.960> we<00:00:15.080> have<00:00:15.350> just<00:00:15.650> a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
bit more organic here we have just a

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.390 
bit more organic here we have just a
basic<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:16.460> frame<00:00:16.789> blink<00:00:18.130> leading<00:00:19.130> with<00:00:19.250> the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
basic and frame blink leading with the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.400 
basic and frame blink leading with the
upper<00:00:19.699> eyelid<00:00:20.060> first<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.810> upper<00:00:21.109> eyelids

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
upper eyelid first so the upper eyelids

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.349 
upper eyelid first so the upper eyelids
would<00:00:21.499> come<00:00:21.740> down<00:00:21.919> a<00:00:21.949> little<00:00:22.099> bit<00:00:22.310> slow<00:00:22.699> you'll

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
would come down a little bit slow you'll

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.009 
would come down a little bit slow you'll
get<00:00:23.539> this<00:00:23.720> slow<00:00:24.109> out<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.849> like<00:00:25.999> on<00:00:26.179> by<00:00:26.419> frame<00:00:26.720> 3

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
get this slow out so like on by frame 3

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.620 
get this slow out so like on by frame 3
it's<00:00:27.169> almost<00:00:27.499> halfway<00:00:27.740> down<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.609> then<00:00:28.669> also

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
it's almost halfway down and then also

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.509 
it's almost halfway down and then also
the<00:00:29.900> bottom<00:00:30.230> lid<00:00:30.409> is<00:00:30.560> moving<00:00:30.949> up<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.189> little<00:00:31.369> bit

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
the bottom lid is moving up a little bit

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.580 
the bottom lid is moving up a little bit
as<00:00:31.640> well<00:00:31.820> they<00:00:32.450> meet<00:00:32.720> in<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:32.930> middle

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
as well they meet in the middle

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.099 
as well they meet in the middle
but<00:00:34.310> then<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.670> upper<00:00:35.000> eyelid<00:00:35.390> would<00:00:35.540> push<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
but then the upper eyelid would push the

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.170 
but then the upper eyelid would push the
lower<00:00:36.289> eyelid<00:00:36.739> down<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.370> then<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.030> would

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
lower eyelid down and then it would

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.330 
lower eyelid down and then it would
retract<00:00:38.870> back<00:00:39.050> up<00:00:39.530> kind<00:00:39.949> almost<00:00:40.190> like<00:00:40.309> a

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
retract back up kind almost like a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.819 
retract back up kind almost like a
bouncing<00:00:40.850> ball<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:41.960> can<00:00:42.079> see<00:00:42.260> how<00:00:42.379> they

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
bouncing ball so you can see how they

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.639 
bouncing ball so you can see how they
both<00:00:43.449> meet<00:00:44.449> a<00:00:44.480> little<00:00:44.960> bit<00:00:45.079> maybe<00:00:45.260> around<00:00:45.469> the

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
both meet a little bit maybe around the

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.040 
both meet a little bit maybe around the
65%<00:00:46.309> mark<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.870> eye<00:00:49.179> but<00:00:50.179> again<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:50.750> this

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
65% mark of the eye but again this this

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.599 
65% mark of the eye but again this this
is<00:00:51.199> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.410> vary<00:00:51.469> depending<00:00:51.890> on<00:00:52.250> your<00:00:52.309> head

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
is going to vary depending on your head

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.759 
is going to vary depending on your head
angle<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.030> stuff<00:00:53.120> but<00:00:53.449> for<00:00:53.629> generic<00:00:54.260> purposes

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
angle and stuff but for generic purposes

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.950 
angle and stuff but for generic purposes
they're<00:00:55.039> going<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.250> meet<00:00:55.370> in<00:00:55.489> about<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.850> 65<00:00:56.420> to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
they're going to meet in about the 65 to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.700 
they're going to meet in about the 65 to
70<00:00:57.530> percent<00:00:57.760> down<00:00:58.760> mark<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.539> eye<00:00:59.710> so

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
70 percent down mark of the eye so

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.340 
70 percent down mark of the eye so
that's<00:01:00.920> just<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.250> basic<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.850> basic<00:01:02.629> basic<00:01:02.809> blink

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
that's just a basic a basic basic blink

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.340 
that's just a basic a basic basic blink
and<00:01:03.530> then<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:03.769> drew<00:01:03.920> up<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.160> basic<00:01:04.400> diagram<00:01:05.350> just

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
and then I drew up a basic diagram just

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.050 
and then I drew up a basic diagram just
to<00:01:06.470> kind<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.710> show<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.190> exact<00:01:07.550> reims

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
to kind of show the exact reims

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.600 
to kind of show the exact reims
for<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.810> frame<00:01:09.409> by<00:01:09.560> frame<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.070> next<00:01:10.340> level

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
for it to frame by frame the next level

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.460 
for it to frame by frame the next level
up<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:10.909> adding<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.540> little<00:01:11.780> bit<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.259> brow

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
up is adding a little bit of a brow

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.770 
up is adding a little bit of a brow
movement<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.100> there<00:01:13.280> too<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.790> then<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> little

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
movement in there too and then a little

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.560 
movement in there too and then a little
bit<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.259> lower<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.549> lower<00:01:16.759> lid<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.270> cheek

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
bit of the lower the lower lid and cheek

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.600 
bit of the lower the lower lid and cheek
too<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.590> you're<00:01:18.740> getting<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.100> compression

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
too so you're getting this compression

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.819 
too so you're getting this compression
from<00:01:20.030> both<00:01:20.240> ends<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.899> so<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.500> kind<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.770> helps

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
from both ends and so this kind of helps

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.770 
from both ends and so this kind of helps
it<00:01:22.189> feel<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.880> little<00:01:22.909> bit<00:01:23.180> more<00:01:23.390> organic

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
it feel just a little bit more organic

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.289 
it feel just a little bit more organic
like<00:01:23.899> everything<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.850> connected<00:01:25.850> which<00:01:26.030> it

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
like everything is is connected which it

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.280 
like everything is is connected which it
is<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.909> that's<00:01:29.329> adding<00:01:29.540> a<00:01:29.720> little<00:01:29.930> bit<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.140> brow

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
is so that's adding a little bit of brow

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.560 
is so that's adding a little bit of brow
a<00:01:30.619> little<00:01:30.920> bit<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.100> lower<00:01:31.280> lid<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.729> then<00:01:32.000> so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
a little bit of lower lid and then so

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.340 
a little bit of lower lid and then so
what<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.780> did<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:33.799> for<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:35.020> here's<00:01:36.020> your<00:01:36.200> main

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
what I did for for that here's your main

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.770 
what I did for for that here's your main
brow<00:01:36.649> mover<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.430> top<00:01:37.640> lid<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.600> would

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
brow mover the top lid and then I would

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.840 
brow mover the top lid and then I would
use<00:01:39.020> these<00:01:39.200> controls<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.979> eye<00:01:40.009> shapers<00:01:40.670> and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
use these controls the eye shapers and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.760 
use these controls the eye shapers and
you<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.659> move<00:01:41.780> these<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.049> little<00:01:42.380> bit<00:01:42.469> up<00:01:42.619> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
you can move these a little bit up and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.370 
you can move these a little bit up and
down<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.670> gets<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.030> nice<00:01:44.450> organic<00:01:44.930> feel

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
down and it gets that nice organic feel

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.529 
down and it gets that nice organic feel
without<00:01:46.219> having<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.789> move<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.210> three<00:01:47.450> of

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
without having to move all three of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.090 
without having to move all three of
these<00:01:47.630> brow<00:01:47.899> controls<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:48.799> just<00:01:48.979> use

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
these brow controls you can just use

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.639 
these brow controls you can just use
this<00:01:49.219> one<00:01:49.280> mover<00:01:49.880> sit<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.899> little<00:01:51.079> bit<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.469> get

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
this one mover sit a little bit to get

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.770 
this one mover sit a little bit to get
to<00:01:51.979> get<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.159> organic<00:01:52.729> miss<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.299> face<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
to get that organic miss in the face and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.690 
to get that organic miss in the face and
the<00:01:54.049> same<00:01:54.229> for<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.500> bottom<00:01:55.280> one<00:01:55.310> here<00:01:55.579> the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
the same for the bottom one here the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.090 
the same for the bottom one here the
bottom<00:01:55.880> shaper<00:01:56.390> as<00:01:56.479> well<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.320> next<00:01:57.530> level<00:01:57.920> up

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
bottom shaper as well the next level up

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.370 
bottom shaper as well the next level up
you<00:01:58.369> can<00:01:58.549> add<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> little<00:01:59.299> bit<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.750> an<00:01:59.990> actual

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
you can add a little bit of an actual

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.490 
you can add a little bit of an actual
pupil<00:02:00.920> move<00:02:01.130> too<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.670> as<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.450> lid<00:02:02.659> passes<00:02:03.170> over

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
pupil move too so as the lid passes over

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.590 
pupil move too so as the lid passes over
the<00:02:03.619> iris<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.189> pupil<00:02:04.219> they<00:02:05.119> can<00:02:05.270> actually

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
the iris and the pupil they can actually

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
the iris and the pupil they can actually
move<00:02:05.810> down<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:06.799> bit<00:02:06.979> with<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.280> lid

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
move down a little bit with the lid

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.690 
move down a little bit with the lid
almost<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.390> lid<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.840> pushing<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.250> iris

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
almost like the lid is pushing the iris

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.550 
almost like the lid is pushing the iris
and<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> pupil<00:02:11.000> when<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.690> goes<00:02:11.870> down<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.349> it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and the pupil when it goes down with it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800 
and the pupil when it goes down with it
and<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.010> same<00:02:13.220> thing<00:02:13.519> when<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> comes<00:02:14.360> up<00:02:14.599> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and the same thing when it comes up you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.869 
and the same thing when it comes up you
could<00:02:14.959> see<00:02:14.989> how<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.349> pupil<00:02:16.220> in<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.310> iris<00:02:16.610> kind

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
could see how the pupil in the iris kind

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.430 
could see how the pupil in the iris kind
of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.710 
of
oh the<00:02:18.010> lid<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.610> comes<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.210> well<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
oh the lid as it comes up as well so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.340 
oh the lid as it comes up as well so
that's<00:02:20.620> another<00:02:20.980> small<00:02:21.610> detail<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.200> add

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
that's another small detail you can add

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.700 
that's another small detail you can add
in<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.100> final<00:02:24.870> nuance<00:02:25.870> thing<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.470> can

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
in there the final nuance thing you can

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.890 
in there the final nuance thing you can
you<00:02:27.010> can<00:02:27.160> kind<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.430> add<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:27.940> would<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you can kind of add in there would be to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
you can kind of add in there would be to
actually<00:02:29.080> offset<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> blanks<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.850> can

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
actually offset the blanks so you can

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
actually offset the blanks so you can
actually<00:02:31.180> had<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> bit<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.960> like<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> either<00:02:32.770> a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
actually had a bit of like a either a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.200 
actually had a bit of like a either a
frame<00:02:33.340> or<00:02:33.880> even<00:02:34.180> half<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.290> frame<00:02:35.530> offset<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.150> you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
frame or even half a frame offset so you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.630 
frame or even half a frame offset so you
can<00:02:37.330> see<00:02:37.510> how<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:39.040> lids<00:02:39.370> come<00:02:39.610> down<00:02:41.640> they

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
can see how the lids come down they

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.630 
can see how the lids come down they
showed<00:02:42.880> us<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.150> couple<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.660> slow-motion<00:02:44.640> views

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
showed us a couple of slow-motion views

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.790 
showed us a couple of slow-motion views
of<00:02:45.760> eyes<00:02:45.910> at<00:02:46.150> work<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.630> people<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.620> that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
of eyes at work and people do do that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.310 
of eyes at work and people do do that
it's<00:02:48.010> very<00:02:48.100> very<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:48.940> subtle<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.050> can't

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
it's very very very subtle you can't

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.220 
it's very very very subtle you can't
really<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> major<00:02:52.030> offset<00:02:52.780> where<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.110> no

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
really have a major offset where you no

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.630 
really have a major offset where you no
one's<00:02:53.650> completely<00:02:53.980> down<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.370> one's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
one's completely down and one's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.420 
one's completely down and one's
completely<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:56.050> again<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.250> could

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
completely up but again you can it could

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.460 
completely up but again you can it could
be<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:57.970> bit<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.240> nuance<00:02:58.480> thing<00:02:58.960> if<00:02:59.140> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
be a little bit of a nuance thing if you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.080 
be a little bit of a nuance thing if you
have<00:02:59.620> time<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.010> add<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:00.640> there's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
have time to add it in there there's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.510 
have time to add it in there there's
another<00:03:01.180> thing<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.810> could<00:03:01.960> do<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:03.280> for

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
another thing you could do just for

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.640 
another thing you could do just for
appeal<00:03:04.120> sake<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.690> if<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.140> course<00:03:05.410> if<00:03:05.560> you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
appeal sake so if you of course if you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.040 
appeal sake so if you of course if you
have<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.800> head<00:03:06.040> turn<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:07.450> probably<00:03:07.840> want<00:03:08.020> to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
have a head turn you probably want to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.440 
have a head turn you probably want to
add<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.200> blink<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.710> there<00:03:08.950> too<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.790> change

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
add a blink in there too for the change

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.050 
add a blink in there too for the change
in<00:03:10.600> eye<00:03:10.720> direction<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.130> here's<00:03:12.670> kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
in eye direction so here's kind of a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.110 
in eye direction so here's kind of a
here's<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.510> generic<00:03:14.220> head<00:03:15.220> turn<00:03:15.550> where<00:03:15.940> all<00:03:16.090> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
here's a generic head turn where all I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.000 
here's a generic head turn where all I
did<00:03:16.420> was<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.870> rotation<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.530> head<00:03:17.710> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
did was the rotation of the head and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.260 
did was the rotation of the head and
just<00:03:18.550> added<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.110> generic<00:03:20.110> blink<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.560> there<00:03:21.270> one

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
just added a generic blink in there one

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.780 
just added a generic blink in there one
thing<00:03:22.480> I'm<00:03:22.600> not<00:03:22.690> taking<00:03:23.080> advantage<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.980> I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
thing I'm not taking advantage of is I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.180 
thing I'm not taking advantage of is I
direction<00:03:25.690> here's<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.959> more<00:03:26.110> refined<00:03:26.500> pass<00:03:26.890> of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
direction here's a more refined pass of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.380 
direction here's a more refined pass of
it<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:29.080> what<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> did<00:03:29.860> was<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.459> know<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.270> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
it and what I did was I know that the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.150 
it and what I did was I know that the
character<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.900> looking<00:03:32.050> screen<00:03:32.560> right<00:03:32.830> so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
character is looking screen right so

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.310 
character is looking screen right so
what<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> did<00:03:33.580> was<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.760> favored<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.750> eye<00:03:34.780> shapes

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
what I did was I favored the eye shapes

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.740 
what I did was I favored the eye shapes
to<00:03:35.560> go<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.950> direction<00:03:36.010> at<00:03:36.670> first<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.630> can

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
to go this direction at first so you can

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.570

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.060 
see how I made this I just a little bit
bigger<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.450> shrank<00:03:40.780> down<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.260> eye<00:03:41.470> same

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070

bigger and I shrank down this eye same
thing<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.520> brows<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.500> same<00:03:44.709> thing

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
thing with the brows and the same thing

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600 
thing with the brows and the same thing
I<00:03:44.980> did<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.489> side<00:03:45.760> here<00:03:46.060> too<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:47.610> then

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
I did for this side here too and then

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.310 
I did for this side here too and then
applying<00:03:48.910> all<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.150> same<00:03:49.450> principles<00:03:52.320> just

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
applying all the same principles just

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.840 
applying all the same principles just
makes<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> feel<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.950> little<00:03:54.160> bit<00:03:54.340> more<00:03:54.400> organic

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
makes it feel a little bit more organic

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.060 
makes it feel a little bit more organic
I<00:03:55.090> did<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.360> offset<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.019> blanks<00:03:56.500> again<00:03:56.920> I'm

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
I did the offset of the blanks again I'm

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.780 
I did the offset of the blanks again I'm
utilizing<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:58.480> brows<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.410> lower<00:03:59.790> lids

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.690 
and cheeks in the in the closing of the
eyes<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.860> nice<00:04:05.860> little<00:04:06.040> thing<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.459> can

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
eyes and a nice little thing to you can

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.370 
eyes and a nice little thing to you can
add<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.600> if<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.610> bottom<00:04:10.209> lids<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.989> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
add is like if the bottom lids and the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.080 
add is like if the bottom lids and the
cheeks<00:04:11.650> are<00:04:11.860> involved<00:04:12.370> too<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:12.790> can<00:04:12.940> also

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
cheeks are involved too you can also

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.970 
cheeks are involved too you can also
involve<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.750> little<00:04:13.989> bit<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.290> nose<00:04:14.500> too<00:04:14.830> so

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
involve a little bit of the nose too so

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.009 
involve a little bit of the nose too so
I<00:04:15.040> put<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.250> little<00:04:15.370> bit<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.760> squish<00:04:16.180> in<00:04:16.510> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
I put a little bit of a squish in the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.349 
I put a little bit of a squish in the
nose<00:04:17.230> as<00:04:17.440> well<00:04:17.470> just<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.519> again<00:04:19.000> it's

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
nose as well just to again it's

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.570 
nose as well just to again it's
conveying<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.440> idea<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.980> everything<00:04:21.280> is

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
conveying the idea that everything is

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
conveying the idea that everything is
connected<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.210> face<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:23.320> if<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.530> eyes<00:04:23.680> are

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
connected on the face so if the eyes are

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.740 
connected on the face so if the eyes are
squishing<00:04:24.250> down<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:25.150> brows<00:04:25.390> are<00:04:25.570> going<00:04:25.690> to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
squishing down the brows are going to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.210 
squishing down the brows are going to
squish<00:04:25.960> down<00:04:26.020> cheeks<00:04:26.860> you're<00:04:27.039> going<00:04:27.160> to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
squish down cheeks you're going to

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.650 
squish down cheeks you're going to
squish<00:04:27.550> up<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.090> nose<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.479> going<00:04:28.600> to

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
squish up and the nose is going to

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.180 
squish up and the nose is going to
squish<00:04:28.870> up<00:04:29.080> just<00:04:29.289> a<00:04:29.350> little<00:04:29.560> bit<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.830> again

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
squish up just a little bit to again

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.050 
squish up just a little bit to again
it's<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.490> making<00:04:30.880> sure

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
it's like making sure

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.970 
it's like making sure
everything<00:04:31.540> feels<00:04:31.810> connected<00:04:32.169> inorganic

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
everything feels connected inorganic

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.159 
everything feels connected inorganic
here's<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.790> quick<00:04:34.030> little<00:04:34.180> thing<00:04:34.480> I<00:04:34.570> did<00:04:34.840> just

here's a quick little thing I did just

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.770 
here's a quick little thing I did just
to<00:04:35.350> show<00:04:35.590> some<00:04:35.860> variation<00:04:36.700> into<00:04:36.970> your<00:04:37.419> blinks

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780

sometimes<00:04:38.620> what<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.889> I<00:04:38.919> would<00:04:39.250> do<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.580> do<00:04:39.700> a

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
sometimes what the I would do is do a

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.760 
sometimes what the I would do is do a
pre<00:04:40.120> blink<00:04:40.450> like<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.720> half<00:04:40.930> blink<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.650> could

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
pre blink like a half blink so you could

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.620 
pre blink like a half blink so you could
add<00:04:41.889> like<00:04:41.919> a<00:04:42.100> maybe<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.580> half<00:04:42.820> blink<00:04:43.180> before<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
add like a maybe a half blink before the

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.140 
add like a maybe a half blink before the
actual<00:04:43.870> blink<00:04:44.169> happens<00:04:44.650> all<00:04:45.520> these<00:04:45.790> are<00:04:45.940> just
