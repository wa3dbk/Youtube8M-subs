six games winning one to nothing I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.030 
six games winning one to nothing I
thought<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.300> first<00:01:45.300> half<00:01:45.600> both<00:01:46.470> teams<00:01:46.770> looked

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.610 
thought the first half both teams looked
okay<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> second<00:01:48.420> half<00:01:48.620> we

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
okay and I think in the second half we

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.050 
okay and I think in the second half we
started<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:50.100> raise<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.520> intensity<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.970> little

started to raise the intensity a little

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
started to raise the intensity a little
bit<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> play<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.870> balls<00:01:52.050> over<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.410> top<00:01:52.620> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
bit and play the balls over the top and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.920 
bit and play the balls over the top and
put<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:53.850> pressure<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> their<00:01:54.480> backs<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
put some pressure on their backs and I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.120 
put some pressure on their backs and I
thought<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.290> better<00:01:55.470> second<00:01:55.830> half<00:01:55.860> than

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
thought it was a better second half than

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
thought it was a better second half than
a<00:01:56.190> first<00:01:56.430> half

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
a first half

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.330 
a first half
out<00:01:58.440> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.620> way<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> thought<00:01:58.980> it'd<00:01:59.160> go<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
out of the way you thought it'd go a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
meridians one of the big rivals of the
season<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.870> it<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.110> good<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.290> come<00:02:07.470> out<00:02:07.560> with

season so it was good to come out with

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
season so it was good to come out with
the<00:02:07.830> win<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> hard<00:02:09.090> game<00:02:09.300> very

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the win but it was a hard game very

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
the win but it was a hard game very
physical<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.619> both<00:02:11.400> teams<00:02:11.610> quite<00:02:11.880> really

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
physical and both teams quite really

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.780 
physical and both teams quite really
well<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.900> rivalry<00:02:13.440> game<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:14.490> take<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
well this is a rivalry game we take it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.250

as<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> rivalry<00:02:15.300> game<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> think<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:15.990> as

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
as a rivalry game I think they do as

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.560 
as a rivalry game I think they do as
well<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:17.490> an<00:02:17.670> awesome<00:02:17.880> game<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.390> even

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
well and it's an awesome game and even

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.300 
well and it's an awesome game and even
if<00:02:18.930> we've<00:02:19.200> gotten<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> better<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> last

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
if we've gotten a better of it the last

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.010 
if we've gotten a better of it the last
couple<00:02:20.520> years<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.910> hasn't<00:02:21.060> been<00:02:21.300> by<00:02:21.510> much<00:02:21.690> I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
couple years it hasn't been by much I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
couple years it hasn't been by much I
don't<00:02:22.350> think<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> last<00:02:22.950> year<00:02:23.160> was<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
don't think this is last year was the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190 
don't think this is last year was the
first<00:02:23.490> year<00:02:23.610> was<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.880> more<00:02:24.209> decided<00:02:24.959> by<00:02:25.020> more

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
first year was this more decided by more

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170 
first year was this more decided by more
than<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.470> goal<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.670> always<00:02:27.000> been<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
than one goal and it's always been a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.370 
than one goal and it's always been a
well-played<00:02:27.390> game<00:02:27.570> doesn't<00:02:27.990> matter<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
well-played game doesn't matter what the
