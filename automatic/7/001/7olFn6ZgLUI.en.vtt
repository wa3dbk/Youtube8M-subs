achieve amplifier it's
it's<00:00:25.420> an<00:00:25.570> in-house<00:00:25.900> development<00:00:26.410> that<00:00:26.620> we've

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
it's an in-house development that we've

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.830

you can check those out but it's a it's
really<00:00:33.280> just<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.820> match<00:00:34.270> out<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.050> other

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
really just to match out that the other

really just to match out that the other
type<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.590> products<00:00:35.890> that<00:00:35.980> we're<00:00:36.190> doing<00:00:36.489> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
type of products that we're doing which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.990 
type of products that we're doing which
orientated<00:00:38.950> towards<00:00:39.250> home<00:00:39.430> theater<00:00:39.850> of

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
orientated towards home theater of

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.340 
orientated towards home theater of
course<00:00:40.150> but<00:00:40.420> we<00:00:40.540> are<00:00:40.660> we're<00:00:40.870> moving<00:00:41.230> into

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
course but we are we're moving into

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.080 
course but we are we're moving into
other<00:00:41.559> markets<00:00:41.770> but<00:00:42.160> since<00:00:42.370> we're<00:00:42.580> started<00:00:42.970> in

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
other markets but since we're started in

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.420 
other markets but since we're started in
that<00:00:43.180> field<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:44.590> thought<00:00:44.800> was<00:00:44.890> important<00:00:45.340> to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
that field we thought was important to

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.119 
that field we thought was important to
offer<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.730> product<00:00:46.090> which<00:00:46.350> again<00:00:47.350> match<00:00:47.860> the

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
offer a product which again match the

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.799 
offer a product which again match the
style<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.640> quality<00:00:48.970> ROI<00:00:49.390> we're<00:00:49.510> trying<00:00:49.750> to

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
style and quality ROI we're trying to

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.410 
style and quality ROI we're trying to
produce<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:51.220> know<00:00:51.340> valve<00:00:51.640> amps<00:00:52.090> tube

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
produce and so you know valve amps tube

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.240 
produce and so you know valve amps tube
amp<00:00:52.600> amplifiers<00:00:53.320> they<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.770> do<00:00:53.890> give<00:00:54.100> their

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
amp amplifiers they really do give their

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.460 
amp amplifiers they really do give their
own<00:00:54.400> unique<00:00:55.300> sound<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:55.840> that's<00:00:55.930> something<00:00:56.199> we

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
own unique sound and that's something we

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.820 
own unique sound and that's something we
wanted<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:57.570> offer<00:00:58.570> our<00:00:58.600> products<00:00:58.900> offer<00:00:59.739> our

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
wanted to offer our products offer our

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.710 
wanted to offer our products offer our
customers<00:00:59.980> it's<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.790> very<00:01:00.970> nice<00:01:01.089> little<00:01:01.239> system

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
customers it's a very nice little system

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.450 
customers it's a very nice little system
alright<00:01:02.500> let's<00:01:02.710> swing<00:01:02.769> by<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.129> see<00:01:03.400> these

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
alright let's swing by and see these

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.149 
alright let's swing by and see these
other<00:01:03.699> ones<00:01:03.970> here<00:01:04.239> all<00:01:04.570> right<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:04.989> fc9

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
other ones here all right so this is fc9

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.370 
other ones here all right so this is fc9
we<00:01:07.120> have<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.270> slightly<00:01:07.659> larger<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.050> you'll<00:01:08.260> get

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
we have a slightly larger one you'll get

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.930 
we have a slightly larger one you'll get
two<00:01:08.560> as<00:01:08.620> well<00:01:08.740> as<00:01:08.860> two<00:01:08.920> FC<00:01:09.220> ten<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.729> they're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
two as well as two FC ten that they're

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.330 
two as well as two FC ten that they're
basically<00:01:10.420> similar<00:01:10.720> design<00:01:11.229> but<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:12.010> one<00:01:12.190> is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
basically similar design but this one is

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.430 
basically similar design but this one is
slightly<00:01:12.840> slightly<00:01:14.790> narrower<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.049> it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
slightly slightly narrower and so it's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.100 
slightly slightly narrower and so it's
just<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:18.360> people<00:01:19.360> who<00:01:19.420> don't<00:01:19.570> want<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.870> fall

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
just for people who don't want to fall

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.580 
just for people who don't want to fall
with<00:01:20.380> kind<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.799> standard<00:01:21.700> AV<00:01:22.659> width<00:01:22.900> component

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
with kind of standard AV width component

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.950 
with kind of standard AV width component
case<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:24.790> just<00:01:25.000> takes<00:01:25.420> up<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.630> little<00:01:25.780> bit

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
case so it just takes up a little bit

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.279 
case so it just takes up a little bit
less<00:01:26.140> room<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.700> with<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.540> lot<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.780> our<00:01:29.020> cases

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
less room but as with a lot of our cases

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.020 
less room but as with a lot of our cases
they're<00:01:29.740> passively<00:01:30.219> cooled<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.759> have<00:01:30.909> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
they're passively cooled so you have the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.679 
they're passively cooled so you have the
two<00:01:31.240> side<00:01:32.110> panels<00:01:32.530> which<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:34.030> connect<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.539> the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
two side panels which we connect to the

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.990 
two side panels which we connect to the
CPU<00:01:35.259> using<00:01:35.740> heat<00:01:36.070> pipes<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:36.820> that's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
CPU using heat pipes and that that's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.109 
CPU using heat pipes and that that's
that's<00:01:37.899> how<00:01:38.049> we<00:01:38.110> call<00:01:38.380> our<00:01:38.530> cases<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.789> don't

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
that's how we call our cases we don't

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.859 
that's how we call our cases we don't
have<00:01:40.329> fans<00:01:40.630> we<00:01:41.590> focus<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.159> no<00:01:42.549> noise<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
have fans we focus on no noise so this

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.599 
have fans we focus on no noise so this
is<00:01:44.020> how<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.229> do<00:01:44.469> it<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.740> would<00:01:44.920> take<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.219> heat

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
is how we do it we would take the heat

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.730 
is how we do it we would take the heat
out<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.030> chasis<00:01:46.420> using<00:01:46.750> using<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.500> fins

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
out of the chasis using using the fins

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.279 
out of the chasis using using the fins
on<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.280> side<00:01:48.490> panels<00:01:48.909> excellent<00:01:49.719> let's<00:01:50.170> go

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
on on the side panels excellent let's go

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.359 
on on the side panels excellent let's go
look<00:01:50.409> at<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:50.799> tiny<00:01:51.070> thing<00:01:51.250> there

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.419 

with<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.609> Nook<00:01:56.240> product<00:01:56.659> from<00:01:56.899> Intel<00:01:57.429> they

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
with the Nook product from Intel they

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.760 
with the Nook product from Intel they
actually<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.539> standard<00:01:59.780> note<00:02:00.140> design<00:02:00.500> comes

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually the standard note design comes

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.240 
actually the standard note design comes
with<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.009> with<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.399> fan<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.170> reel<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:03.590> where<00:02:04.130> we

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
with a with a fan and reel as where we

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.179 
with a with a fan and reel as where we
really<00:02:04.460> opposed<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:05.030> noise<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.689> we<00:02:06.409> took<00:02:06.590> their

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
really opposed to noise so we took their

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.699 
really opposed to noise so we took their
case<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.759> we<00:02:08.300> redesigned<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.050> also<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.470> we

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
case and we redesigned it also so we

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.190 
case and we redesigned it also so we
designed<00:02:10.039> our<00:02:10.190> own<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.690> basically<00:02:11.690> with<00:02:11.959> we

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
designed our own and basically with we

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.710 
designed our own and basically with we
we<00:02:13.010> taken<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.580> new<00:02:14.090> product<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.629> we've

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
we taken the the new product and we've

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.740 
we taken the the new product and we've
made<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.930> totally<00:02:15.560> passive<00:02:15.860> totally<00:02:16.400> silent

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
made it totally passive totally silent

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.570 
made it totally passive totally silent
and<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.830> something<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> little<00:02:19.280> bit

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and and in something a little bit

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
and and in something a little bit
stylish<00:02:20.000> too<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:21.019> actually<00:02:21.319> use<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.709> actual

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
stylish too we actually use the actual

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.640 
stylish too we actually use the actual
sides<00:02:22.489> as<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.910> not<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.650> design

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
sides as it is not just for design

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.740 
sides as it is not just for design
feature<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.549> also<00:02:25.610> allows<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.060> internal

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
feature it also allows for internal

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.920 
feature it also allows for internal
Wi-Fi<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:28.849> really<00:02:29.090> will<00:02:29.329> look<00:02:29.480> very<00:02:29.750> nice

look
let's<00:02:43.230> zoom<00:02:43.499> in<00:02:43.739> on<00:02:43.799> those<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:44.219> for<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.489> second

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
to push the boundaries of design and we

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.759 
to push the boundaries of design and we
really<00:03:36.150> go<00:03:36.569> hard<00:03:36.840> before<00:03:37.049> we<00:03:37.319> produce<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
really go hard before we produce the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.349 
really go hard before we produce the
desktop<00:03:38.189> a<00:03:38.219> lot<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.489> people<00:03:38.790> ask<00:03:38.939> me<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
desktop for awhile and well we had to do

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.939 
desktop for awhile and well we had to do
different<00:03:42.989> because<00:03:43.109> that's<00:03:43.290> what<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:43.799> and

we really tried to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.040 
we really tried to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
desktop and I mean it's interesting

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.020 
desktop and I mean it's interesting
because<00:03:51.620> we<00:03:51.800> call<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.160> desktop<00:03:52.580> but<00:03:52.790> most<00:03:52.970> of

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
because we call it desktop but most of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.730 
because we call it desktop but most of
the<00:03:53.120> time<00:03:53.330> we<00:03:53.690> kind<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.050> shove<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.350> under<00:03:54.470> the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
the time we kind of shove it under the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.370 
the time we kind of shove it under the
desk<00:03:54.890> because<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:56.000> doesn't<00:03:56.270> look<00:03:56.390> great<00:03:56.540> so

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
desk because it doesn't look great so

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.900 
desk because it doesn't look great so
what<00:03:57.560> we<00:03:57.650> did<00:03:57.770> here<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.040> we<00:03:58.130> wanted<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.610> design

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
what we did here is we wanted to design

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.330 
what we did here is we wanted to design
something<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.810> every<00:04:00.320> angle<00:04:00.650> looks

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
something that for you every angle looks

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.900 
something that for you every angle looks
really<00:04:02.090> nice<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:03.590> think<00:04:04.100> if<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.340> can<00:04:04.580> yeah

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
really nice and I think if you can yeah

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.030 
really nice and I think if you can yeah
as<00:04:05.150> you're<00:04:05.420> doing<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.140> can<00:04:06.320> see<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> really

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
as you're doing you can see it really

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.220 
as you're doing you can see it really
does<00:04:07.160> look<00:04:07.670> pretty<00:04:08.300> good<00:04:08.450> from<00:04:08.810> every<00:04:08.930> angle

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
does look pretty good from every angle

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.620 
does look pretty good from every angle
and<00:04:09.440> it's<00:04:10.100> not<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.460> about<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.910> looks<00:04:11.090> we

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
and it's not just about the looks we

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.200 
and it's not just about the looks we
have<00:04:11.660> again<00:04:12.620> using<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.340> side<00:04:13.550> panels<00:04:13.970> or

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
have again using the the side panels or

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.300 
have again using the the side panels or
for<00:04:14.480> cooling<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.350> time<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:15.770> have<00:04:15.920> four

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
for cooling this time we have four

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.150 
for cooling this time we have four
surfaces<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.270> were<00:04:17.390> cool<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:18.040> right<00:04:19.040> now

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
surfaces that were cool and right now

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.020 
surfaces that were cool and right now
each<00:04:19.310> surface<00:04:19.610> we're<00:04:20.000> rating<00:04:20.570> around<00:04:20.870> 65<00:04:21.500> TDP

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
each surface we're rating around 65 TDP

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.520 
each surface we're rating around 65 TDP
and<00:04:23.030> with<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> four<00:04:23.570> surfaces<00:04:23.810> what<00:04:24.260> we<00:04:24.350> can

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
and with the four surfaces what we can

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.880 
and with the four surfaces what we can
do<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:24.920> can<00:04:25.070> use<00:04:25.480> one<00:04:26.480> service<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:27.050> CPU<00:04:27.410> or

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
do is we can use one service for CPU or

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.980 
do is we can use one service for CPU or
even<00:04:28.190> two<00:04:28.370> surfaces<00:04:28.880> for<00:04:29.030> CPUs<00:04:29.450> have<00:04:29.630> even<00:04:29.870> up

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
even two surfaces for CPUs have even up

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.950 
even two surfaces for CPUs have even up
to<00:04:30.140> 130<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.250> they're<00:04:31.460> combined<00:04:31.940> one<00:04:32.660> side

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
to 130 what if they're combined one side

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.140 
to 130 what if they're combined one side
will<00:04:33.140> be<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.290> GPU<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.640> other<00:04:34.760> side<00:04:35.000> is

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
will be the GPU and the other side is

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.110 
will be the GPU and the other side is
for<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.810> passive<00:04:36.380> PSU<00:04:36.920> which<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.430> have<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.970> that

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
for a passive PSU which we have so that

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.090 
for a passive PSU which we have so that
will<00:04:38.270> basically<00:04:38.960> allow<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.770> build<00:04:39.920> a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
will basically allow you to build a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.060 
will basically allow you to build a
really<00:04:40.460> completely<00:04:41.090> silent<00:04:41.570> desktop<00:04:42.530> case

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.040 

and<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.370> turn<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.090> around<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.570> can<00:04:46.690> see<00:04:46.720> like

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
and you turn that around we can see like

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.710 
and you turn that around we can see like
the<00:04:47.290> connections

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720

oh<00:04:54.570> it's<00:04:55.080> all<00:04:55.200> underneath<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.860> so<00:04:56.010> underneath

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
oh it's all underneath it so underneath

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.750 
oh it's all underneath it so underneath
yeah<00:04:56.640> but<00:04:56.940> that's<00:04:57.210> that's<00:04:57.570> how<00:04:57.780> we<00:04:57.840> get<00:04:58.080> the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
yeah but that's that's how we get the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.360 
yeah but that's that's how we get the
uniform<00:04:59.760> look<00:04:59.940> all<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> way<00:05:00.270> around<00:05:00.540> okay

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
uniform look all the way around okay

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.430 
uniform look all the way around okay
it's<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.490> surprise<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:02.940> me<00:05:03.270> obviously<00:05:06.440> where's

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
it's a surprise to me obviously where's

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.430 
it's a surprise to me obviously where's
the<00:05:07.560> power<00:05:07.770> button<00:05:08.130> also<00:05:10.820> okay<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.720> again

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
the power button also okay and again

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.680 
the power button also okay and again
it's<00:05:13.710> for<00:05:13.770> ITX<00:05:14.340> we<00:05:14.700> did<00:05:14.880> focus<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.420> on<00:05:15.660> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
it's for ITX we did focus on on the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.620 
it's for ITX we did focus on on the
smaller<00:05:16.050> form<00:05:16.350> factors<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.330> we<00:05:18.330> think<00:05:18.540> you

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
smaller form factors and we think you

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.620 
smaller form factors and we think you
know<00:05:18.720> ITX<00:05:19.170> is<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:20.130> is<00:05:20.820> it<00:05:21.030> it's<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.420> growing

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
know ITX is it is it it's a growing

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.749 
know ITX is it is it it's a growing
market<00:05:22.070> operator<00:05:23.070> keep<00:05:23.400> here
