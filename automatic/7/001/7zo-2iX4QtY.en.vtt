00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 English people call that the day after 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.240
 the night before 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.059
 in other words, how does psv behave in the morning 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 after the defeat against the Bulgarian ludo 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.389
 corvettes in the first match the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 group stage of the europa league 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 so fleece two mail leaves of course the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 leave necessary damage what during 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 with Phillip Cocu are about to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.609
 begin what was that physical damage from 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.600
 yesterday evening 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.869
 yes your etro the stig failed so that 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.760
 we will see that tomorrow or 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.480
 or which can be used is for Sunday 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.410
 he gave her an inner tube of his knee 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.579
 my son says and made block tackle 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 it seems so bad but good too 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.070
 need to drill that can test on the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
 training that he can do everything or that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 employable 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.180
 yes we understand you today as a precaution 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 already got abel tamata from the group 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.629
 he seems to be his logical replacement 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.110
 You can't watch who can't play 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.910
 our occupancy players who come to young PSV 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.609
 play may not be with us 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.620
 peeters that's why we attend the training sessions 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.239
 well committed that is about the physical 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.309
 damage and the possible solutions 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 but of course also plays the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.750
 mental downer along with such a defeat 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.350
 legal go save them on paper unknown 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.479
 plow 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.420
 that work by how great is the mental 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 damage but last night was a whole 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 disappointing 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 from how i think we sure 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.100
 here too there are more gone and then 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.869
 its very hard to convert that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 to switch as a team 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.600
 yeah that's not ideal preparation 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
 the match against ajax it is then 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 closed today 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.259
 I expanded more extensively 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.509
 come back to that match 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.240
 make to close the book but 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.840
 to learn the train from what happened 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.119
 is and luckily we have nice calls 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 topper at the door and you have the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.829
 chance to be able to revanch you can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.490
 also a kind I can touch a kind of make 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.719
 up call yes look we have here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.030
 falls of learned have not 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.530
 may appear as if 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.590
 past match 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 she said convinced but good 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.900
 remains a topper was the natural 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.640
 more difficult and so good 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.959
 opponent we meet without 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.300
 phillip had cocu last wednesday evening 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.810
 extended the opportunity to ajax 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.850
 see 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.620
 he saw the team on television in the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.870
 play the first champions league match 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.690
 against barcelona and with four zero 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.730
 what did that think of that ajax 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.819
 I found them to be very pretty stuff 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 we made barcelona difficult 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.400
 play football and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.540
 but second half you could see that the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.790
 difference bigger laws was a step up 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.500
 thereby switching it the difference 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.660
 could only make one thing that she definitely did 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.850
 have offered quite a shit 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.690
 that you are similar to milan psv yes 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.730
 a bit comparable 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.470
 yes you actually do not have much with you 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.410
 less playing football 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.610
 and at the right times 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.380
 hits the opponent then the bee 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.120
 Barcelona and Ajax also had a number 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.700
 possibilities and they don't have them 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.200
 silver plated you have the feeling that ajax 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.519
 he returned with the departure of all the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.209
 world when I leave them 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.930
 names this is always a process in which 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.860
 going to ajax psv or feyenoord clubs is that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.700
 stabbing go several players 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.170
 leave 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.980
 I think that's the majority 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.500
 van of the team is together at ajax 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.570
 there have been minor changes where 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.860
 they had already anticipated 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.100
 with 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.829
 with hearing and duarte 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.310
 so are some other players 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.299
 large part of the floor is belly 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.590
 if frank the farmer well yesterday on the 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.890
 press conference say what he thinks 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.470
 ajax favorite is that say yes then after one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.510
 that regard indicating that is in fact 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.459
 also so because they are farther in 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.930
 development 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.600
 in terms of team then we are pointing one 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.609
 and many changes 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.620
 so within the team had that regard 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.620
 I think it's true
