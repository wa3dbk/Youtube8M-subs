anyway so it doesn't matter

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
anyway so it doesn't matter
but<00:01:12.119> eventually<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.080> gonna<00:01:13.320> bring<00:01:13.590> more

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
but eventually they are gonna bring more
of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> major<00:01:14.159> titles<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.909> basically<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> way

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
of the major titles on basically the way

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
of the major titles on basically the way
they<00:01:15.869> described<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.490> your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
they described it is if you have your

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.100 
they described it is if you have your
disc<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.360> eventually<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.049> able

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
disc I think eventually you just be able

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
disc I think eventually you just be able
to<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.470> disc<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.009> Xbox<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
to put your disc in your Xbox one you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.770 
to put your disc in your Xbox one you
know<00:01:20.820> they'll<00:01:20.970> probably<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
know they'll probably just you have to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.940 
know they'll probably just you have to
download<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.110> update<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.650> whatever

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
download some update or whatever

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
download some update or whatever
eventually<00:01:23.490> whenever<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.150> happens<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
eventually whenever it happens and I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.670 
eventually whenever it happens and I
guess<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.470> able<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
know you're gonna be able to play it and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.240 
know you're gonna be able to play it and
you<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.110> they'll<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.380> keep<00:03:01.530> moving<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you know they'll just keep moving on and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.870 
you know they'll just keep moving on and
on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> list

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
on the list

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.790 
on the list
eventually<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.320> eventually<00:03:04.769> I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
eventually I don't know if eventually I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.680 
eventually I don't know if eventually I
mean<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.160> might<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.550> get<00:03:05.880> every<00:03:06.510> single

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
mean they might not get every single

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.960 
mean they might not get every single
game<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.530> ever<00:03:07.709> been<00:03:08.160> made<00:03:08.400> or<00:03:08.670> whatever

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
game that's ever been made or whatever

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.580 
game that's ever been made or whatever
I'm<00:03:09.209> thinking<00:03:09.269> they'll<00:03:09.720> probably<00:03:09.900> stop<00:03:10.290> after

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
I'm thinking they'll probably stop after

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.350 
I'm thinking they'll probably stop after
around<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.070> 100<00:03:11.489> or<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.970> don't<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.209> maybe

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
around like 100 or so I don't know maybe

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.880 
around like 100 or so I don't know maybe
they'll<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:12.720> them<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.230> don't<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.590> how

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
they'll do them all I don't know how

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
they'll do them all I don't know how
much<00:03:14.010> effort<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.670> time<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.300> money<00:03:15.450> or

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
much effort in time and money or

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.120 
much effort in time and money or
whatever<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.230> takes<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.830> do<00:03:16.980> what

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
whatever it really takes to do what

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.410 
whatever it really takes to do what
they're<00:03:17.280> trying<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.910> long<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.209> your

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
they're trying to do as long as your

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.750 
they're trying to do as long as your
game<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> fairly<00:03:19.920> popular<00:03:20.130> game<00:03:20.549> I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
game is like a fairly popular game I

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 
game is like a fairly popular game I
think<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.120> safe<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.420> say<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.989> will<00:03:22.260> be

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
think it's safe to say that it will be

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.340 
think it's safe to say that it will be
brought<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.610> Xbox<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.299> if<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.959> never<00:03:25.140> hurts

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
brought to the Xbox one if I never hurts

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.830 
brought to the Xbox one if I never hurts
to<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.739> go<00:03:25.920> cast<00:03:26.160> your<00:03:26.340> boat<00:03:26.549> now

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
to you know go cast your boat now

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.759 
to you know go cast your boat now
personally<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.260> should<00:03:28.410> vote<00:03:28.440> for

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
personally I think you should vote for

personally I think you should vote for
black<00:03:28.890> ops<00:03:29.100> 2<00:03:29.400> or<00:03:29.640> black<00:03:29.820> ops<00:03:30.000> 1<00:03:30.329> or<00:03:30.780> maybe<00:03:31.049> even

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
black ops 2 or black ops 1 or maybe even

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.350 
black ops 2 or black ops 1 or maybe even
more<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.010> work<00:03:32.190> hard<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.700> those<00:03:33.150> are

more what for to work hard for those are

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.970 
more what for to work hard for those are

when<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.400> 40,000<00:03:42.269> votes<00:03:42.450> they're<00:03:43.079> gonna

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
pretty much it also oh the last thing is

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.250 
pretty much it also oh the last thing is
well<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.820> guess<00:03:48.090> I'll<00:03:48.239> add<00:03:48.360> this<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:48.870> you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
well I guess I'll add this in here you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.100 
well I guess I'll add this in here you
will<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.739> able<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.980> play<00:03:50.220> against<00:03:50.880> Xbox<00:03:51.390> 360

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
will be able to play against Xbox 360

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.900 
will be able to play against Xbox 360
players<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:52.829> well<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:53.280> that's<00:03:53.459> pretty<00:03:53.670> cool

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
players as well so that's pretty cool

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.430 
players as well so that's pretty cool
because<00:03:54.120> otherwise<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.750> population<00:03:55.320> would

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
because otherwise the population would

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.410 
because otherwise the population would
have<00:03:55.470> been<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:56.010> small<00:03:56.579> on<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> Xbox<00:03:57.329> one

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
have been really small on the Xbox one

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.509 
have been really small on the Xbox one
only<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.799> pretty<00:03:59.010> good<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.310> still

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
only so it's pretty good that you still

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.340 
only so it's pretty good that you still
get<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.670> play<00:03:59.880> against<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.180> Xbox<00:04:00.540> 360<00:04:01.110> players

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
get to play against the Xbox 360 players

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.509 
get to play against the Xbox 360 players
now<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.799> don't<00:04:01.890> really<00:04:02.130> know<00:04:02.220> how<00:04:02.310> that's<00:04:02.430> gonna

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
now I don't really know how that's gonna

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.229 
now I don't really know how that's gonna
work<00:04:02.730> out

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
work out

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.340 
work out
seems<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:03.810> gonna<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.019> kind<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.200> weird

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
seems like it's gonna be kind of weird
