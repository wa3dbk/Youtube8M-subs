00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.490
 edo brunner yes why do you own one 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340
 car week we test 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 yes this is so ad and e in terms of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.470
 path with our cabernet proposal in one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.149
 come and the decor proved too large and too 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 much to my 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.739
 citroÃ«n berlingo to fit so then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 we have the wise people at volkswagen 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.829
 company cars the netherlands 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.019
 figured it was a good idea for you 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.170
 that we could use this bus 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.089
 so that the driver is over and that and so 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.910
 may endurance tests 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.650
 right yes 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.190
 and what kind is it there 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.980
 Volkswagen transporter such an emotional one 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 oh and the leather seats that still remember 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.580
 more about navigation 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.369
 180 horsepower sir 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.680
 idea really where things get really fast like 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.100
 the fire brigade and mine prepare very well 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.100
 tidy with it 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.369
 white enough put him aside 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.580
 what is it 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.100
 eww of course great what kind of bus he 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.580
 drives but let's 7 in the details 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.510
 to dive 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 indeed it is one 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.830
 Volkswagen Transporter 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 with the second length that Volkswagen 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.160
 so the range does not have 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 the cost variant that you can choose 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.240
 but just one longer takes care of course 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 for just a little more luggage space 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 and also that two-liter diesel is 100 correct 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.440
 180 hp and 400 meter above-mentioned one coupling 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.970
 that is exactly what these transports are like 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.759
 interesting 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.350
 because that engine coupled to a DSG 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.390
 automatic gearbox provides 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 make sure you actually do these transports 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.410
 can drive like a passenger car 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.090
 because the more you do that on the outside 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.140
 don't see it so it's really a raft 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.680
 device sure of 180 wants that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.420
 absolutely he 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.030
 is not built for higher speeds 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 my feet are at home and what I like 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.349
 clever find a transport there is here 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.349
 with very fast to his car on the higher 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.700
 speeds is a good place to be 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.049
 maybe a bit noisy in it 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.079
 comparison with a passenger car 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.189
 but you feel like a king 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.139
 you also go a bit like one 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.060
 bus driver driving so hear your fingers 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.530
 at the wheel and if you need a roundabout 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.420
 You almost tend to tackle with 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.909
 to operate such a dial 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.069
 but all in all a very pleasant cabin 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.239
 to be on board part of the power 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.040
 is also in the chassis 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.480
 because these transports is really one 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.150
 amazing 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
 very smoothly suspended bus very pleasant 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.599
 for all those for if it strikes me whole 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.129
 very excited and he didn't crawl but catches 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.930
 despite the high weight of this car 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.689
 19 100 pounds 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.349
 very nice that blows yes this is then 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.919
 turning again is not being 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.919
 greatest strength 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.180
 and yet wonder what kind of person 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 buy this well you have to check it is one 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.580
 work van in bidding said but then 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.290
 from 70,000 euros and yes like me 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.730
 said then you indeed have navigation on 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.280
 board cruise control 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.440
 steering wheel control old grandma leather 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.680
 upholstery and so on 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.630
 but then you can still answer that question 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.090
 are someone who has a family and the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.140
 would like to bring a lot of things 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.670
 someone who is normal for example 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.710
 Spoken in the market there are for suit 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.570
 bite him and bmw x5 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.190
 and a car that can take a lot of things 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.870
 many things can 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.850
 and yet also pleasant travel comfort 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.250
 offers for five people 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.459
 Well for such an x5 you pay around 120,000 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.960
 euro and this therefore 70 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.850
 a lot of money but you also get serious 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.530
 lots of cars 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.210
 it remains an endurance test so true 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.190
 we have run into so far 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.860
 which immediately strikes me with my two 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.110
 meter 4 is that in transport for one 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.520
 taller people are not the most relaxed 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.800
 buggies to drive 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.840
 this link wings is just in the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.669
 away for my knee 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.410
 edo a lot smaller which is good in 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.400
 So maybe it's me but 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.810
 it is something to be reckoned with 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.610
 to hold 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.860
 and then something that straight nose that grabs 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.230
 me fly a lot young this car is 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.610
 been in use for a few weeks now and we are 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.950
 already through the first tank 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.840
 wiper fluid 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.940
 so yes you often go against that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.310
 walk and then something about that ahead 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.830
 He already has a stone for them to choose 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.570
 so got the first crack 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.250
 is a fact but good that can accident 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.900
 I am very curious how this bus 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.160
 to come normal is about living to one 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.000
 ona it is not going anyway 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.340
 lie 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.430
 do you want more information about their show 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.660
 pumps then look at edel and arie.nl 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.669
 and you want more information about this 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.669
 transport there remain awe follow
