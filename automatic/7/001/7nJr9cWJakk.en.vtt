the case is 20 plus you're going against

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.610 
the case is 20 plus you're going against
level<00:01:11.420> 12<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:11.870> they<00:01:11.930> give<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.170> more<00:01:12.320> glimmer

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
level 12 so they give you more glimmer

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.220 
level 12 so they give you more glimmer
than<00:01:12.890> most<00:01:13.070> sponsors<00:01:13.520> well<00:01:13.730> on<00:01:13.970> hard<00:01:14.420> on<00:01:14.720> later

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.530 
than most sponsors well on hard on later
missions<00:01:15.680> on<00:01:15.860> Mars<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.940> it's<00:01:17.120> definitely

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
missions on Mars so it's definitely

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.320 
missions on Mars so it's definitely
