00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
can easily see both targets but I can't

can easily see both targets but I can't
see<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.070> small<00:00:46.309> crosshair<00:00:46.969> okay<00:00:47.809> all<00:00:48.230> right

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
see this small crosshair okay all right

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.580 
see this small crosshair okay all right
so<00:00:48.530> we<00:00:48.739> do<00:00:49.039> need<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.460> aim<00:00:50.030> in<00:00:50.600> at<00:00:51.079> something

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
so we do need to aim in at something

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.279 
so we do need to aim in at something
that's<00:00:51.739> very<00:00:51.920> specific<00:00:52.899> we<00:00:53.899> might<00:00:54.079> use<00:00:54.260> a

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
that's very specific we might use a

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.200 
that's very specific we might use a
sharpie<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.550> make<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.910> little<00:00:56.030> bit

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
sharpie to to make that a little bit

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.819 
sharpie to to make that a little bit
bigger<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:56.600> could<00:00:56.809> see<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.079> or<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.680> this

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
bigger so you could see it or in this

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.560 
bigger so you could see it or in this
case<00:00:58.100> with<00:00:58.309> this<00:00:58.489> target<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.030> offers<00:00:59.390> so

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
case with this target that offers so

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.110 
case with this target that offers so
many<00:00:59.660> different<00:00:59.809> aiming<00:01:00.590> images<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:01.699> can<00:01:01.879> pick

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
many different aiming images we can pick

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.610 
many different aiming images we can pick
something<00:01:02.390> like<00:01:02.719> maybe<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.109> point<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
something like maybe the point of the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.999 
something like maybe the point of the
triangle<00:01:03.920> or<00:01:04.850> something<00:01:05.509> specific<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.680> place

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
triangle or something specific to place

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.090 
triangle or something specific to place
your<00:01:07.430> crosshair<00:01:08.110> intersection<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.350> that'd<00:01:09.950> be

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
your crosshair intersection on that'd be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.889 
your crosshair intersection on that'd be
great<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.640> see<00:01:10.789> those<00:01:10.940> easily<00:01:11.390> all<00:01:11.690> right

okay good now we're going to check your
natural<00:01:21.080> point<00:01:21.319> of<00:01:21.440> aim<00:01:21.619> now<00:01:22.280> your<00:01:22.520> natural

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:22.849 
natural point of aim now your natural

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.609 
natural point of aim now your natural
point<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.179> aim<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.599> kind<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.899> like<00:01:24.080> your<00:01:24.259> body's

magnetic north every body comes to a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.240 
magnetic north every body comes to a
point<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.959> rest<00:01:30.440> where<00:01:30.709> they're<00:01:30.830> using<00:01:31.009> as

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
we're relaxing those muscles not to the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.809 
we're relaxing those muscles not to the
point<00:02:06.379> where<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.679> can't<00:02:06.890> hold<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.220> rifle<00:02:07.429> up

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
point where we can't hold the rifle up

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.850 
point where we can't hold the rifle up
but<00:02:08.300> we're<00:02:08.450> introducing<00:02:09.020> as<00:02:09.140> little<00:02:09.500> muscle

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
but we're introducing as little muscle

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.740 
but we're introducing as little muscle
tension<00:02:10.280> as<00:02:10.399> possible<00:02:11.030> because<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.720> more

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
tension as possible because the more

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.320 
tension as possible because the more
muscle<00:02:12.260> tension<00:02:12.590> we<00:02:12.739> use<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:13.940> movement

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
muscle tension we use the more movement

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110 
muscle tension we use the more movement
there's<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.989> be<00:02:15.080> actually<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:16.730> open

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
there's going to be actually now open

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
high now we can adjust that

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.760 
high now we can adjust that
moving<00:02:23.490> your<00:02:23.700> support<00:02:24.330> hand<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.990> little<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.380> we

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
moving your support hand a little bit we

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.890 
moving your support hand a little bit we
could<00:02:25.890> also<00:02:26.069> do<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.670> by<00:02:27.120> changing<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
could also do that by changing the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
could also do that by changing the
position<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.410> our<00:02:28.560> forward<00:02:29.010> rest<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.580> kind

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
position of our forward rest it's kind

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.510 
position of our forward rest it's kind
of<00:02:29.880> your<00:02:30.060> choice<00:02:30.470> okay<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.709> move<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.490> my

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
backhand and I'm back on my point of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
backhand and I'm back on my point of
angle<00:02:34.800> alright<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.310> we're<00:02:35.430> gonna<00:02:35.520> try<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
angle alright and we're gonna try that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.270 
angle alright and we're gonna try that
one<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.180> time<00:02:36.630> go<00:02:37.020> ahead<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.650> take<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> couple

one more time go ahead and take a couple

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.340 
one more time go ahead and take a couple
of<00:02:38.370> deep<00:02:38.550> breaths<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.240> eyes<00:02:39.390> closed

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
of deep breaths with your eyes closed

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.350 
of deep breaths with your eyes closed
now<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.070> often<00:02:41.220> happens<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> when<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> open

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
now what often happens is when you open

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.510 
now what often happens is when you open
your<00:02:42.690> eyes<00:02:42.900> you'll<00:02:43.410> be<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> little<00:02:43.920> bit<00:02:44.040> left<00:02:44.310> or

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
your eyes you'll be a little bit left or

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.520 
your eyes you'll be a little bit left or
right<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.500> is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
right and what you need to do then is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.030 
right and what you need to do then is
adjust<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:47.640> entire<00:02:48.120> body<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.800> move

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
adjust your entire body not just move

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.920 
adjust your entire body not just move
around<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.550> your<00:02:50.730> arm<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.570> rifle

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
around with your arm so that the rifle

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
around with your arm so that the rifle
barrel<00:02:52.230> has<00:02:52.319> changed<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> want<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> move

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
barrel has changed but you want to move

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.170 
barrel has changed but you want to move
your<00:02:53.730> entire<00:02:54.209> body<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.989> get<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.970> reticle<00:02:56.970> or

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
your entire body to get that reticle or

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.479 
your entire body to get that reticle or
that<00:02:57.510> intersection<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.320> crosshairs<00:02:58.860> back<00:02:59.280> on

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that intersection of crosshairs back on

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.160 
that intersection of crosshairs back on
your<00:02:59.640> aiming<00:02:59.790> point<00:03:00.120> open<00:03:00.720> your<00:03:00.870> eyes<00:03:00.989> and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
your aiming point open your eyes and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.590 
your aiming point open your eyes and
tell<00:03:01.320> me<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.560> you're<00:03:01.709> on<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.160> was<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.420> left

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
tell me if you're on I was to the left

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.470 
tell me if you're on I was to the left
okay<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> left<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.360> we

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
okay so you're to the left and so we

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180 
okay so you're to the left and so we
need<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> adjust<00:03:06.930> your<00:03:07.350> body<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:07.950> you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
need to adjust your body so that you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100 
need to adjust your body so that you
move<00:03:08.400> back<00:03:08.700> towards<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> right<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.930> what

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
move back towards the right so what

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.540 
move back towards the right so what
direction<00:03:10.590> should<00:03:10.739> your<00:03:10.920> whole<00:03:11.160> body<00:03:11.459> move<00:03:12.239> in

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
direction should your whole body move in

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.680 
direction should your whole body move in
yes<00:03:14.550> yes<00:03:15.440> okay<00:03:16.880> sometimes<00:03:17.880> it'll<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.150> shifting

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
yes yes okay sometimes it'll be shifting

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.690 
yes yes okay sometimes it'll be shifting
to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.959> left<00:03:19.170> depending<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.400> know<00:03:20.519> what

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
to the left depending on you know what

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.640 
to the left depending on you know what
your<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.180> your<00:03:21.330> pivot<00:03:21.750> point<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.530> your

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
your what your pivot point is for your

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
your what your pivot point is for your
body<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.519> will<00:03:23.700> largely<00:03:23.910> depend<00:03:24.239> on

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
body and that will largely depend on

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.289 
body and that will largely depend on
what<00:03:24.780> shooting<00:03:25.320> position<00:03:25.709> you're<00:03:25.890> using<00:03:26.299> okay

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
what shooting position you're using okay

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.449 
what shooting position you're using okay
good<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.019> we'll<00:03:28.110> do<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.500> more<00:03:28.530> time<00:03:28.739> it's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
good and we'll do it one more time it's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.250 
good and we'll do it one more time it's
important<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.239> verify<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.750> natural

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
important that you verify this natural

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.199 
important that you verify this natural
point<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.590> aim<00:03:31.769> because<00:03:32.040> at<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.730> moment<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
point of aim because at the moment that

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.539 
point of aim because at the moment that
you<00:03:33.329> actually<00:03:33.840> press<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.200> trigger<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.190> human

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
you actually press the trigger the human

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.240 
you actually press the trigger the human
body<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:36.030> whatever<00:03:36.209> reason<00:03:36.750> does<00:03:37.590> relax

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
body for whatever reason does relax

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.640 
body for whatever reason does relax
momentarily<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.420> when<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.750> does<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.290> goes

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
momentarily and when it does it goes

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.130 
momentarily and when it does it goes
back<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.280> natural<00:03:41.549> point<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.030> aim<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.870> if

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
back to natural point of aim so if

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.890 
back to natural point of aim so if
you're<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.410> already<00:03:43.650> there<00:03:44.310> your<00:03:45.239> group<00:03:45.690> will

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you're not already there your group will

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.509 
you're not already there your group will
be<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.500> place<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.980> didn't<00:03:47.190> intend<00:03:47.459> it

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
be in a place that you didn't intend it
