00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.000
 after the win against Le Mans or the wild DAX, Arslan will benefit in the next 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 Take it a bit easier 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 When weighing the day before the fight he has brought exactly 90 kilos on the scales 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.089
 In the next few weeks, only a moderate training is on the program 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 the preparations for the cup is won deductions works o2 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.019
 So there it really goes on for several weeks every day 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.259
 Training sessions I really protect up to six liters of fluid 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.149
 and the business with policies over 200 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.210
 and where the body demands a lot from me before the body 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.200
 I have to go hungry. I have to lose weight 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.540
 bring and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.020
 I do not have to worry about Paul being surrounded by that "Maybe 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.880
 somehow 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.920
 flying away a few days but of course not exercising that way but patient 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.990
 so loose as momentary active jogging just relax 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 Go swimming a bit with order 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 To play Zeus table tennis flippers badminton simply play things 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.140
 Still fun to do fitness 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.490
 the fight against or flood Arslan no visible injuries 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.930
 leave 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.340
 the sweetie was clearly superior to the Czechs right from the start, I am glad 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.790
 that Jürgen Klopp has won a safe World Cup 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 she let her service through who is already believed in my victory but he 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.750
 Finally, more often given a maximum of ten dead was his statement before the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 The fight for the day's victory as an athlete does not have to believe because 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.650
 if we did not finally give the decline to the front that is now so 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.420
 Which 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.299
 As you know in advance never I believed in my victory but it is 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.030
 actually ran theirs as I wanted and I'm just glad that it 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.540
 My team has done a great job, says Aguilera 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.450
 Some Glockner Castro will not have their Atomic Games in a row they can have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350
 everyone just does great work together and the ladies too 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 Sparring partner 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.000
 Warcraft, whether the per se very good percent 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.860
 him after indexed and 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 the United States could not run better 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.009
 In 2003, Fiat Arslan had a fight against Le Mans or in Prague on points 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.620
 lost a controversial decision 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.350
 the victory on Friday, however, undisputed, the technical Coro would have even 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.800
 can come earlier 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.240
 actually the referee's verdict so I have to say 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.760
 Cities were four times on the ground and many balls on the second their hits up there 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.530
 even world associations so at unfortunately it is not so burning most 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.490
 Associations Spy train is bad the fight is over and IBF complements ex-club 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.000
 One day before, due to construction works, Rüdiger Sagel cut him well again 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.459
 Product have spoken only there is no trend yet and then forms that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.249
 is over 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.069
 but Berglandes also ten times percent 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.959
 that are already extreme for the athlete but at some point must be because 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 because the superiority was too obvious 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.790
 Support during the fight got Firat Arslan of the over 3000 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.579
 Spectators in the Göppinger ews-arena 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.680
 The Süßener can well imagine again in Göttingen boxing and hopes 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.239
 on another Tonight case, hiding audiences next year 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.150
 So honest with me then means when audience desires 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.520
 the band is so class SPOX over the long time but winning is nothing 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.240
 comparably so does not come for nothing Willi South and they have 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.579
 really win percent made all honor and I'm quite happy this 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.069
 Having support had that was madness Asus has me already normal 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.579
 still ne Eckbert to extra-power given after the successful revenge against Le 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.389
 Mans to there are only two boxers in the Kursaal weight against the four decency 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.409
 lost 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.589
 so he would like his open accounts with the Frenchman Jeremy 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.839
 Irons and especially with Livia World Champion Jones from Panama settle 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.299
 whether it comes to that is not yet clear 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.409
 The next fight of the 40-year-old is in all likelihood on the 24th of September 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.209
 in Turkey
