00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.619 
first thing we want to do for video
purposes<00:00:55.289> I'm<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.160> speed<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> up

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
purposes I'm going to just speed this up

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
purposes I'm going to just speed this up
we<00:00:57.629> would<00:00:57.870> soak<00:00:58.109> our<00:00:58.320> hemp<00:00:58.559> plus<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.430> chili

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
we would soak our hemp plus the chili

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
we would soak our hemp plus the chili
flakes<00:01:00.120> overnight<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.250> going

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
flakes overnight and what that's going

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
flakes overnight and what that's going
to<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.650> flavor<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to do is some of the flavor from the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
to do is some of the flavor from the
crushed<00:01:05.580> chili<00:01:06.570> flake<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> absorb

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
crushed chili flake is going to absorb

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
crushed chili flake is going to absorb
into<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> hemp<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.880> create<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> nice

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
into the hemp a little bit create a nice

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.410 
into the hemp a little bit create a nice
flavor<00:01:09.900> profile<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> said<00:01:12.150> because

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
flavor profile and like I said because

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
flavor profile and like I said because
this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> flake<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.380> basically<00:01:13.799> adding

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
this is a flake it's basically adding

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
this is a flake it's basically adding
another<00:01:14.490> particle<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.330> mix<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
another particle to your mix and I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
another particle to your mix and I
really<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.920> using<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.549> spod<00:01:17.909> mixes

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
really like using this for spod mixes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
really like using this for spod mixes
particularly<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.770> add<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
particularly but you can add in the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
particularly but you can add in the
ground<00:01:20.460> baits<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.330> really

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
ground baits and you know really

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.090 
ground baits and you know really
whatever<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
whatever you want to you can make it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
whatever you want to you can make it
probably<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.030> PVA<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> PVA

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
probably put in PVA if you make a PVA

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
probably put in PVA if you make a PVA
friendly<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.799> salt<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> probably<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
friendly with salt and probably do a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
friendly with salt and probably do a
video<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.750> later<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.310> get

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
video on that later but you can get

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
video on that later but you can get
started<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.409> now<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> said<00:01:31.950> we're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
started with that now like I said we're

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
started with that now like I said we're
going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> soak<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> overnight<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.329> then

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going to soak this overnight and then

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
going to soak this overnight and then
we're<00:01:34.170> boiling<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.619> probably<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.009> 30-40

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we're boiling it probably about 30-40

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
we're boiling it probably about 30-40
minutes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
minutes

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.770 
minutes
and<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:37.229> once<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> heat<00:01:38.850> will

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and then once we take it off a heat will

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
and then once we take it off a heat will
add<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> chili<00:01:40.680> hemp<00:01:40.950> oil<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.250> last<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
add in the chili hemp oil will last I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.389 
add in the chili hemp oil will last I
didn't<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> last<00:01:43.439> just

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
didn't like that that's in last just

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.460 
didn't like that that's in last just
because<00:01:44.610> oil<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.840> seems<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> works<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
because oil it seems like it works a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.840 
because oil it seems like it works a
little<00:01:46.560> better<00:01:46.770> adding<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> later

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
little better adding it in later

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
little better adding it in later
like<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> said<00:01:48.770> chili<00:01:49.770> hemp<00:01:50.009> oil<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.430> really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like I said chili hemp oil it's really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749 
like I said chili hemp oil it's really
good<00:01:50.880> you're<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.240> tractor<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.649> lot<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
good you're out a tractor a lot of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
good you're out a tractor a lot of
feeding<00:01:54.090> stimulants<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.649> thing

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
feeding stimulants in this and the thing

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.990 
feeding stimulants in this and the thing
about<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
about this when you actually see the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
about this when you actually see the
bottle<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.860> thick<00:01:59.310> oil<00:01:59.670> it's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
bottle it's not really a thick oil it's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.679 
bottle it's not really a thick oil it's
a<00:02:00.689> pretty<00:02:00.960> thin<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> would<00:02:03.090> infuse<00:02:03.450> into

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a pretty thin so it would infuse into

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.990 
a pretty thin so it would infuse into

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
thin not only will it infuse in it
