00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
right here and they probably go up a

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.149 
right here and they probably go up a
pipe<00:05:48.300> anyway<00:05:49.300> there's<00:05:49.629> solid<00:05:50.080> brass<00:05:50.319> and

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
they're all over to create they give an

00:05:52.719 --> 00:06:00.140 
they're all over to create they give an
82<00:05:53.409> like<00:05:53.560> 90<00:05:53.919> signal<00:05:54.659> there's<00:05:55.659> one<00:05:55.839> right<00:05:55.990> here

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.720 

pretty<00:06:00.690> sure<00:06:00.870> that's<00:06:01.050> one<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:02.460> now<00:06:02.520> here<00:06:02.700> at

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
pretty sure that's one and now here at

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.129 
pretty sure that's one and now here at
the<00:06:02.820> pinpointer<00:06:03.360> normally<00:06:03.810> it's<00:06:03.900> just<00:06:03.930> right

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
the pinpointer normally it's just right

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.950 
the pinpointer normally it's just right
on<00:06:04.230> top<00:06:04.260> but<00:06:04.940> let's<00:06:05.940> see

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
on top but let's see

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.980 
on top but let's see
I'll<00:06:08.410> fill<00:06:08.650> it

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
I'll fill it

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.360 
I'll fill it
