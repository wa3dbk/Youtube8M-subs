00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.980 
I've got the top on I'm gonna take my
pen<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:58.149> FYI

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
pen just FYI

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.260 
pen just FYI
and<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:01.180> I<00:02:01.210> gonna<00:02:01.899> do<00:02:02.050> I'm<00:02:02.410> gonna<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:03.270> draw

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and what I gonna do I'm gonna do is draw

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.540 
and what I gonna do I'm gonna do is draw
two<00:02:04.509> dots<00:02:04.750> where<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.170> want<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.009> start<00:02:06.340> and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
two dots where I want it to start and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.120 
two dots where I want it to start and
end<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:09.210> reckon<00:02:10.210> about<00:02:10.270> here<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.290> usually<00:02:11.800> do

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
end so I reckon about here I usually do

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.070 
end so I reckon about here I usually do
it<00:02:12.340> like<00:02:12.700> where<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> feels<00:02:13.540> right<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.959> right

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it like where it feels right like right

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.620 
it like where it feels right like right
it<00:02:14.170> feels<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.620> gonna<00:02:15.630> feel

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
it feels like it's gonna feel

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.460 
it feels like it's gonna feel
comfortable<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.380> start<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> end<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:20.140> too

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
comfortable to start and end and not too

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.180 
comfortable to start and end and not too
big<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.470> wrong<00:02:23.620> point<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.130> just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
big and if I do the wrong point I just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.790 
big and if I do the wrong point I just
mark<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.819> again<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:26.020> want<00:02:26.200> too<00:02:26.319> much<00:02:26.590> you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
mark it again I just want too much you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.380 
mark it again I just want too much you
see<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.069> because<00:02:27.220> I've<00:02:27.819> done<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> mark

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
see that because I've done the mark

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.460 
see that because I've done the mark
there<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.900> thought<00:02:29.080> that's<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.319> bit

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
there and then I thought that's a bit

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.920 
there and then I thought that's a bit
big<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> mark<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.610> as<00:02:30.730> well<00:02:30.910> okay<00:02:31.150> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
big as I'm a mark there as well okay and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.309 
big as I'm a mark there as well okay and
then<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> other<00:02:32.950> side

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.199 

I'll<00:02:35.590> put<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.860> about<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.190> same<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:37.000> I'm<00:02:37.060> gonna

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
I'll put it about the same now I'm gonna

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.120 
I'll put it about the same now I'm gonna
take<00:02:37.420> my<00:02:37.630> top<00:02:37.810> off<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.730> cut<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.500> okay<00:02:41.500> well<00:02:41.770> you

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
guys down on the floor with me so I'm

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.900 
guys down on the floor with me so I'm
trying<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.040> show<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:46.569> easier<00:02:46.959> okay<00:02:47.910> so

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
trying to show you a bit easier okay so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.800 
trying to show you a bit easier okay so
you<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.050> see<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> dot<00:02:50.709> here<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.970> dot<00:02:52.270> here

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you can see a dot here and a dot here

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.860 
you can see a dot here and a dot here
this<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:53.980> probably<00:02:54.550> not<00:02:54.790> right<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.599> honest

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
this is probably not right to be honest

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.070 
this is probably not right to be honest
for<00:02:56.110> life

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080

that have they have like one big handle
which<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.830> more<00:03:10.370> straight<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.330> when<00:03:11.450> like

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690

anything else that's how it looks
and<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:47.199> tiny<00:05:47.710> bit<00:05:47.800> big<00:05:48.160> like<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:49.030> bit<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.300> a

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
and it is a tiny bit big like a bit of a

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.110 
and it is a tiny bit big like a bit of a
big<00:05:49.690> neckline<00:05:50.229> but<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.830> think<00:05:51.340> it's<00:05:51.490> fine<00:05:51.789> and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
big neckline but I think it's fine and

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.999 
big neckline but I think it's fine and
this<00:05:52.330> is<00:05:52.449> how<00:05:52.570> it<00:05:52.659> looks<00:05:52.810> at<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.050> back<00:05:53.229> the

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
this is how it looks at the back the

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.939 
this is how it looks at the back the
label<00:05:54.340> there<00:05:54.930> you<00:05:55.930> can<00:05:56.199> if<00:05:56.620> you've<00:05:56.830> got

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
label there you can if you've got

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.770 
label there you can if you've got
already<00:05:57.069> obviously<00:05:57.669> well<00:05:57.970> you<00:05:58.060> can<00:05:58.270> just<00:05:58.479> cut

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
already obviously well you can just cut

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.520 
already obviously well you can just cut
the<00:05:58.900> label<00:05:59.020> off<00:06:00.780> but<00:06:01.780> I<00:06:01.810> think<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.169> looks<00:06:02.319> fine

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
the label off but I think it looks fine

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.490 
the label off but I think it looks fine
if<00:06:03.190> you<00:06:03.460> cut<00:06:03.669> it<00:06:03.699> too<00:06:03.849> big<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.539> you<00:06:05.259> want<00:06:05.440> to
