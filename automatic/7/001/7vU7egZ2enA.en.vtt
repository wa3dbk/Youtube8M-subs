00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.570 
think but now I've got to turn it a
little<00:02:14.670> bit<00:02:15.800> because<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.040> yucky<00:02:17.340> side

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
little bit because the yucky side

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.450

I lost my nice little contour but look
at<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:32.040> alright<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:33.489> just<00:03:33.640> going<00:03:33.790> to

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
at that alright so I'm just going to

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.470 
at that alright so I'm just going to
keep<00:03:34.000> pushing<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.689> it<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:36.120> see<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.329> can

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
keep pushing in on it and see if I can

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.140 
keep pushing in on it and see if I can
get<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.719> looking<00:03:37.959> even<00:03:38.319> better<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.760> we'll<00:03:40.000> see

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
get it looking even better and we'll see

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.660 
get it looking even better and we'll see
what<00:03:40.299> happens<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:41.500> we<00:03:41.829> figured<00:03:42.069> out<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.519> if

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
what happens okay we figured out that if

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.580 
what happens okay we figured out that if
you<00:03:42.760> kind<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.060> push<00:03:43.239> on<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.540> top<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.109> it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
you kind of push on the top of it it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.399 
you kind of push on the top of it it
rotates<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.220> down<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.730> bit

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
rotates it down a little bit

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.690 
rotates it down a little bit
seems<00:03:47.409> to<00:03:47.620> go<00:03:47.739> down<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.430> bit<00:03:48.549> more

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
seems to go down just a little bit more

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.099 
seems to go down just a little bit more
we're<00:03:48.879> not<00:03:49.030> really<00:03:49.299> trying<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.659> get<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.930> all

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
we're not really trying to get it all

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.420 
we're not really trying to get it all
the<00:03:50.139> way<00:03:50.260> down<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:50.859> we're<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.189> wanting<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the way down but we're just wanting to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.149 
the way down but we're just wanting to
make<00:03:51.579> sure<00:03:51.730> it's<00:03:51.879> in<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.120> snug<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.920> think

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
make sure it's in there snug and I think

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.940 
make sure it's in there snug and I think
we've<00:03:54.340> pretty<00:03:55.329> much<00:03:55.480> gotten<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.139> we're<00:03:56.769> almost

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
we've pretty much gotten it we're almost

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.280 
we've pretty much gotten it we're almost
done

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
done

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.720 
done
all<00:03:59.290> right<00:03:59.500> so<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.829> think<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.220> got<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.489> all<00:04:00.579> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
all right so I think we got it all the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.599 
all right so I think we got it all the
way<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:01.139> notice<00:04:02.139> we<00:04:02.319> didn't<00:04:02.620> we<00:04:03.040> didn't<00:04:03.340> really

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
way in notice we didn't we didn't really

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.710 
way in notice we didn't we didn't really
it's<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.540> right<00:04:04.840> on<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.079> line<00:04:05.829> of<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.250> black

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's just right on the line of the black

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.039 
it's just right on the line of the black
little<00:04:07.720> dots<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:09.250> are<00:04:09.370> on<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.579> windshield

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
little dots that are on the windshield

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.270 
little dots that are on the windshield
except<00:04:11.049> for<00:04:11.230> right<00:04:11.349> there<00:04:11.560> but<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.010> think

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
except for right there but I think

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.679 
except for right there but I think
overall<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.700> think<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.120> dashboard<00:04:13.540> looks

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
overall I think the dashboard looks

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.170 
overall I think the dashboard looks
really<00:04:13.930> good<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:15.129> hope<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.579> video<00:04:15.819> helps

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180
