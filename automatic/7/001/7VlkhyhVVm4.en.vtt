00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 it speaks the extended family in 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 kazan calls his wife the cafÃ©s 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 dance and our four children are sitting 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.550
 small of the comedian and here it comes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 I hid and wanted today 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 first glad that we again as 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.109
 family can be there for you 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 and I wanted to answer a question 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 which we have received again and again 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.929
 it's about whether it's really necessary 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.640
 is a generator to own if you are 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.399
 to successfully start it up 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.059
 a raw food on the raw food diet 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.850
 what is the wire or actually 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 in the hydro is a kitchen appliance that 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 food dehydrates but below 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 from 41 degrees celsius because we are all out 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 the biology out 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.660
 all enzymes are an organism 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 or even plant us on the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 keep alive and important substances 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.390
 Just exchange for those for the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.720
 life process within living 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.430
 matter over 41 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 Degree 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.340
 Of course, it takes some people to stop 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.540
 a bit longer but if you only 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.939
 long enough what about 41 degrees celsius 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.159
 heated it simply dies biologically 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.470
 clearly proven and that's why yes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 The hydra tor designed so that because 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 she gets a dry device that it below 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 of 41 degrees things or food 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 on different levels with dry 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.780
 with the fan behind it warm 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.030
 air over the different levels 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 blows over it and so this water or 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 pulls out and so that said the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.149
 enzymes and the vital substances within the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.600
 foods are kept alive and fresh 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.600
 for us 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.380
 st 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.990
 totally on what you want to achieve 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.689
 if you like some for yourself 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.520
 raw food nutrition interest 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.319
 with of a disease background 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.379
 are you just really sick? 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.069
 are and one of yours, so to speak 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.290
 The last hope for cure is then 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.260
 the wire gate is not necessarily 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.819
 necessary because then I would you 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.250
 love recommend as simple as possible 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.230
 eat mono to eat everything means single 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 fruits easy to eat or not 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.130
 Much to mix and get back to the food 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.290
 to process but as simple as possible 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.930
 and easy to eat themselves to drink 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 then the wire is not that important 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.260
 if that is background then if you 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.030
 but now I was really for that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.250
 the masses speak the people 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.989
 not only because she is super 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.879
 sick are so raw food come but 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.500
 because you just want to become healthier 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.319
 and because you are enthusiastic about the idea 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.510
 the raw food and a few easy 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:59.690
 want to change unhealthy eating habits 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.290
 want to improve then mine is 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.329
 Advice yes, look that you in the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.100
 hydrates get why there are 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.540
 raw food diet just like me 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.709
 understand as I said there are other people 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.709
 they say something different but like me 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.540
 that does not mean that you all 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.970
 your wishes and preferences behind 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.910
 you never let it carrot and carrot 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.500
 salad is or something or or or or 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.690
 Do you understand that's not the point 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.919
 not at all the point and keep that 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.450
 I always important in the yard because of the 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.090
 people always think euro costs is like that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 one-sided and something like oh no, please do 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.790
 you drives the not so easy to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.980
 hydra tor but also so that as 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.389
 as an important tool you can just 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.230
 so many of his dishes that we love 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:54.079
 is you in a healthy way 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.470
 Substitute and that's what I think 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.200
 at least it's about saying yes 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.700
 to eat and that one says yes to his 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.049
 You also do not need to lust 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.260
 to leave behind me you can they 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.450
 continue those earlier 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.710
 and easy with healthy raw food 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.110
 Substitute rubber recipes and that is 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.109
 my tip for all not as I said 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.390
 just a short short clan or one 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.120
 short the talks want to make of 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.380

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.920
 Change your diet in the longer term

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.530
 really a one a good medium because 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.080
 you can do things like ice cream 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.510

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.730

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.770
 no need now for ice cream is 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.810
 maybe clear but for many delicious 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.460
 dishes that you might like to eat 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.660
