00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
 so be the 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.759
 he considers what can the 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.379
 quality 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.720
 not only crops off but 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.000
 also 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.840
 additionally falls work 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.770
 For one, he can be young or 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 hazards 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.660
 we now want to talk, we make 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.250
 start the course recording like 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 load carrier now times smaller but 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 it was 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 so 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.220
 when the mode is finally synonymous 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.740
 just a good query 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.070
 the only difference is we have to 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.860
 the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.920
 I have the hat 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.199
 in which the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.430
 should be active for the mode that is the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.550
 tip out 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.470
 is turned on with a 2 kept 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.880
 Point 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 to narrow down that is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.300
 the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 fertilizer mode we use 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.920
 and at the end 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 you have a point 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.009
 good 1 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.890
 stop here translated here again 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000
 Wait point between these two wait 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.160
 points 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.160
 He will therefore unfold its peak 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.879
 is affected 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.200
 is time 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.550
 Zurich 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.580
 it must, I often tried several times 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 not always is the first 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.440
 waypoint in reach of the carrier we 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.690
 of course, the guy must be typed too 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.350
 thin is now firmly forgotten 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.180
 put first 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.520
 who to the first way and the smarts 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.020
 he worked out automatically 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.540
 Here there is a small bug that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.130
 he will only load that only 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 started because then even the vehicle 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.660
 that is still on the list that fits 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.820
 that is eliminated if you are 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.740
 a vehicle in stupid mode must have 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.990
 you just change it when he's here 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.140
 is so if now but I am full 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.650
 I promise I'm not a keyboard 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.430
 the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 look it 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.050
 from 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.689
 was noon 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.830
 with his device off 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.519
 so the tip will unfold 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.150
 turn on 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.740
 learns 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.330
 always at level 2 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.910
 to explain 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.890
 which we too 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.760
 so 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.180
 most of you can think of yourself 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.180
 happens 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.150
 stop again 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.370
 his 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.249
 fold and turn off 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.340
 and 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.680
 home ask the 2 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.300
 believe or not do 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.419
 instead, on the screen edge 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.180
 a message remains his work 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.949
 Unfortunately, I am not finished 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.949
 I can not show what I do not do much right now 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.889
 must be had if we have that now 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.139
 whole field would have retracted here so 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.520
 would have these 1000 liters of injection yes 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.090
 not nearly enough 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.610
 In this case, the departing driver notices 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.340
 the position at the the sprayer 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.039
 has gone out of this 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.039
 position back to the bathing area 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.060
 makes his tip full again 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.370
 here for the first wait point of this 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.750
 first point he drives directly to the 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.550
 point at which the injection agent 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.330
 went out and did his job 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.789
 continue 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.759
 yes that was essentially the thin one 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.360
 mode in the next part then follows the 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:43.870
 explanation of the field mode and the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.360
 not really hot tip on the courses 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.360
 more manually retract yourself
