 we press the entrance we get into the account 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.169
 For example, select the event winner 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.390
 rugby world cup 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 choose union man day world cup 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.720
 winners 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.250
 proposed for bargaining 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 eleven outcomes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480
 rates for which he is in 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 green zone 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.780
 residues against 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.770
 in red 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 best ratios 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.070
 supply projects are in red 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.970
 square 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 suppose we want to bet 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 the process of winning the world cup her ar 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.430
 click on the red square 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 all 2 in this case coefficient 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.410
 which offered 63 dollars 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.250
 for seeing fish playing if we want 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.690
 challenge this proposal 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.560
 We accept the full amount of Alina part of her 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.530
 and we type in squares crazy stakes in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 receipts 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.310
 for example, we want to take artemov 20 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.360
 dollars 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 our risks in this case will amount to $ 124 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 if we want to know on which coefficient we 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.660
 we risk a special 124 dollars and to 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.850
 get our pariba century at 20 dollars 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.570
 let's turn to the formula coefficient 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 50 ns separated unit 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 that is, the system and 2 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 divided by 6 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.590
 there are two of them 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 we get the coefficient 1 16 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.550
 that is, at five cents 1 16 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.890
 risking like e124 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 dollar 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.250
 and deduct the amount essentially our bets 124 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.640
 a dollar we get 20 dollars 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.229
 our profit 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.519
 excluding commissions 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.409
 we will win this amount if 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.849
 any other team will be the winner 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.069
 except her ap 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.909
 and if she wins and gives away her digging 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.260
 our risk park is $ 124 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.269
 and then it is itself red 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.599
 also we can notice from the top and then 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.349
 what in this case 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.469
 the rate against its barre is estimated at only 14 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.519
 percent 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.499
 if we want to bet against 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.789
 new zealand click on red 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:46.719
 square 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.619
 Vladivostok 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.869
 let's say the same 20 dollars and our lawyer 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.859
 at this rate will be $ 30 and 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:55.990
 40 cents 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.800
 in view of the fact that he is an officer 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.279
 much higher 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.039
 that is, when 2 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.829
 May 52 divide by 1 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.229
 52 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.689
 what will be 1 and 66 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.369
 If you multiply this ratio by 100 sea 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.179
 have to 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.069
 30 ti and 4 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.370
 and authorities 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.049
 our costs 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.899
 30 and 4 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.389
 we get 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.209
 20 dollars profit 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.319
 respectively, profits and losses 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.319
 indicated by the poet names and gatherings 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.319
 if we are going to make this bet 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.129
 the so-called bet 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.999
 after confirming the bid we will 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
 wait for the result of the World Cup 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.129
 let's take it in order also on this 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.969
 nice 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:52.419
