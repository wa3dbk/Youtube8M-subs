00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:47.470 
tired so I just tried going the other
way<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.640> took<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> while<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.180> was<00:01:47.240> kind<00:01:47.450> of

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
way and it took a while it was kind of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.290 
way and it took a while it was kind of
annoying<00:01:47.750> but<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.770> worked<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.340> there<00:01:50.180> was<00:01:50.270> one

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
annoying but it worked and there was one

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.330 
annoying but it worked and there was one
guy<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.690> was<00:01:50.930> asking<00:01:51.110> me<00:01:51.350> about<00:01:51.410> my<00:01:51.590> China<00:01:52.040> i

the type of sound that you want and the
ZHT<00:02:04.640> had<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.540> washy<00:02:06.020> type<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.560> sound

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
ZHT had a really washy type of sound

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.830 
ZHT had a really washy type of sound
with<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.550> didn't<00:02:07.850> sound<00:02:08.030> good<00:02:08.209> alone<00:02:08.540> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
with it it didn't sound good alone it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.510 
with it it didn't sound good alone it
only<00:02:08.990> sounded<00:02:09.380> good<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.590> combination<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.399> this

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
only sounded good in combination to this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.440 
only sounded good in combination to this
crash<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.650> Wuhan<00:02:12.860> has<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.030> really

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
crash so this the Wuhan has a really

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.110 
crash so this the Wuhan has a really
like<00:02:14.930> whitening<00:02:15.410> crack<00:02:15.890> sound<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.640> then

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
like whitening crack sound with it then

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.440 
like whitening crack sound with it then
I<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.420> because<00:02:17.780> it's<00:02:17.959> thin<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:19.459> did<00:02:20.180> hit

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
I like because it's thin and I did hit

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.820 
I like because it's thin and I did hit
it<00:02:20.480> too<00:02:20.720> hard<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.080> sort<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.380> cracked<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.770> a

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
it too hard and sort of cracked it a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.150 
it too hard and sort of cracked it a
little<00:02:21.980> bit<00:02:22.160> which<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.459> fixed<00:02:22.850> but<00:02:23.800> that's<00:02:24.800> why

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
little bit which I fixed but that's why

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.070 
little bit which I fixed but that's why
it<00:02:25.220> sounds<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:25.910> good<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.780> thin

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
it sounds so good is because it's thin

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.970 
it sounds so good is because it's thin
it's<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.350> heavy<00:02:27.950> as<00:02:28.100> all<00:02:28.250> hell<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.950> lot<00:02:30.950> of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it's not heavy as all hell like a lot of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
it's not heavy as all hell like a lot of
the<00:02:31.190> other<00:02:31.580> sheet<00:02:31.910> bronze<00:02:32.150> type<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.630> symbols

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.590 

and<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:38.570> think<00:02:39.200> that's<00:02:39.350> about<00:02:39.470> it
