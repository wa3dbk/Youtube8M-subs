00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.470 
it is H 233 h and it's 23 inch
widescreen<00:02:34.260> monitor<00:02:35.070> with<00:02:35.730> 16<00:02:36.480> 29<00:02:36.990> ratio<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
widescreen monitor with 16 29 ratio I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.910 
widescreen monitor with 16 29 ratio I
think<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.720> contrast<00:02:40.140> ratio<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.620> forty

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
think the contrast ratio is forty

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.290 
think the contrast ratio is forty
thousand<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.680> pretty<00:02:43.860> good<00:02:44.100> um<00:02:44.340> i

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
thousand to one so it's pretty good um i

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.460 
thousand to one so it's pretty good um i
can<00:02:45.870> use<00:02:46.020> hdmi<00:02:46.620> vga<00:02:47.070> or<00:02:47.580> DVI<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.959> that's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
can use hdmi vga or DVI on it so that's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190 
can use hdmi vga or DVI on it so that's
