game<00:01:38.420> game<00:01:39.420> speed<00:01:39.719> usually<00:01:39.929> I<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
game game speed usually I think it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
game game speed usually I think it
believes<00:01:40.859> it<00:01:41.009> either<00:01:41.159> slower<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> almost

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
believes it either slower and almost

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
believes it either slower and almost
default<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> usually<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.350> usually<00:01:43.979> was

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
default but I usually you usually was

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.870 
default but I usually you usually was
fast

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
fast

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.489 
fast
but<00:01:44.969> it<00:01:45.090> feels<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.289> real

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
but it feels like a you know like a real

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.120 
but it feels like a you know like a real
NFL<00:01:46.799> game<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.939> player<00:01:48.380> minimal<00:01:49.380> speed<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
NFL game the player minimal speed here I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.050 
NFL game the player minimal speed here I
don't<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:50.969> much<00:01:51.179> of<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.789> usually<00:01:53.789> leave<00:01:53.969> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
don't use much of it I usually leave it
