00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
when I did my first ever disassembly of

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.920 
when I did my first ever disassembly of
a<00:00:08.920> vintage<00:00:09.250> pocket<00:00:09.640> watch<00:00:09.850> the<00:00:10.690> first

a vintage pocket watch the first
question<00:00:11.290> I<00:00:11.350> had<00:00:11.530> was<00:00:11.740> how<00:00:11.950> to<00:00:11.980> invite<00:00:12.400> the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
question I had was how to invite the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.270 
question I had was how to invite the
mainspring<00:00:13.260> it<00:00:14.260> happened<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.680> be<00:00:14.800> tightly

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
mainspring it happened to be tightly

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.630 
mainspring it happened to be tightly
wound<00:00:15.670> up<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.150> needed<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:16.539> be<00:00:16.660> let<00:00:16.839> down<00:00:17.640> on

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
wound up and needed to be let down on

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.429 
wound up and needed to be let down on
the<00:00:18.849> internet<00:00:19.150> I<00:00:19.269> could<00:00:19.449> only<00:00:19.599> find<00:00:19.900> textual

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
the internet I could only find textual

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.499 
the internet I could only find textual
instructions<00:00:20.980> on<00:00:21.099> how<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.279> do<00:00:21.519> this<00:00:21.699> but<00:00:22.359> no

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
instructions on how to do this but no

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.650 
instructions on how to do this but no
demonstration<00:00:23.320> video<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:24.970> decided<00:00:25.329> to<00:00:25.449> make

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
demonstration video so I decided to make

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.950 
demonstration video so I decided to make
one<00:00:25.869> myself<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:28.029> watch<00:00:28.210> I'll<00:00:28.419> use<00:00:28.689> for<00:00:28.900> this

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
one myself the watch I'll use for this

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.569

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
market this without a serial number but

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.880 
market this without a serial number but
its<00:00:37.090> style<00:00:37.570> suggests<00:00:38.290> it's<00:00:38.440> probably
