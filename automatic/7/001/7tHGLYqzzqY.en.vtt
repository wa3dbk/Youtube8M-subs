00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 we are here to resolve an issue 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.960
 on the use of tub occupies a figure 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.570
 geometric pattern of consumption in its 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.830
 it is as if it were a data that is used 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 of the game 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.570
 it has the three equal areas 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.570
 let's bet 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 talk to paulo has seven meters 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.920
 the tax 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:56.390
 the volume is well that question is again 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 simple agent remembered where it occurs is 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 exactly the type the formula that gives us 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.060
 pride everything that comes to an answer 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.460
 in an easy and rubber way given by 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.799
 angola to spain raised the voice 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.690
 to deal with the subject 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.000
 paint this is the value only the result 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.570
 for exercise response 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.420
 come on we know the theft was w is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:36.500
 equal to 4% to 5 UOL 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.830
 There is the fire was afonso on one side. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:47.320
 for the other to facilitate the visualization 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.320
 night you drag the cube to 104 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:00.649
 then go kio masterizou t 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:04.700
 we would have and verify exactly how 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.220
 calculate this for it 's cube 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.090
 trading with knives interporto he can 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.230
 to be caught 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.489
 this action we want in that the 64 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 it can be equal to that at 4 pesos 4 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.410
 you sing 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.870
 therefore it is 100 with four and will take you to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.650
 Cup was active 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.670
 if this value 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.410
 therefore it will be equal and 14 that it 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.730
 used the fifth 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.410
 it will be our starting point is the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.950
 answer 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:54.370
 Look at the intention we have from one side to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.550
 third on the other side four taken to the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550
 3rd 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.320
 the mayor asked aside he's 3d 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.290
 wife and the other side of the guitar 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:15.550
 exponent of the bases only by soldiers 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:18.490
 therefore being equal to four 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.030
 the unit how to run away from the actress published 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.140
 books in a debate duck meters 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.800
 this is the answer to the very question 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.800
 grateful
