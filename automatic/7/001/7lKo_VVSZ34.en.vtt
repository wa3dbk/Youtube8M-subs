of these

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
of these
ridges<00:02:12.200> along<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.770> side<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.819> add<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
ridges along the side that really add to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090 
ridges along the side that really add to
the<00:02:14.240> look<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> was<00:02:15.709> talking<00:02:16.040> about

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
the look and what I was talking about

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100 
the look and what I was talking about
earlier<00:02:16.220> when<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.670> mentioned<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.510> port<00:02:17.810> covers

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
earlier when I mentioned the port covers

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.170 
earlier when I mentioned the port covers
port<00:02:18.800> covers<00:02:19.100> actually<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> ridges<00:02:19.910> as

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
port covers actually have the ridges as

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
port covers actually have the ridges as
well<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.600> when<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.750> get<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.020> all<00:02:21.200> installed

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
well so when I get this all installed

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.260 
well so when I get this all installed
you'll<00:02:21.740> see<00:02:21.950> how<00:02:22.040> great<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.370> looks<00:02:22.670> so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
you'll see how great it looks so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.230 
you'll see how great it looks so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the best way to do it and then it just

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.840 
the best way to do it and then it just

kind of snaps on installs pretty easily
not<00:02:31.850> hard<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> little<00:02:32.540> bit<00:02:32.630> tougher<00:02:32.870> to

get it off but installation is not
difficult<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:36.020> do<00:02:36.110> want<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.319> make<00:02:36.410> sure<00:02:36.470> you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
difficult you do want to make sure you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.979 
difficult you do want to make sure you
kind<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.190> line<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.520> up<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.790> did<00:02:38.000> noticing<00:02:38.450> notice

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
kind of line it up I did noticing notice

a little bit of bubbling going on with
my<00:02:40.790> screen<00:02:41.090> shield<00:02:41.330> when<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.230> didn't<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.650> it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
my screen shield when I didn't have it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.190 
my screen shield when I didn't have it
kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.069> seated<00:02:43.610> perfectly<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> once<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.989> got

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
kind of seated perfectly and once I got

let's<00:02:48.200> put<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> dot<00:02:48.920> covers<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:49.820> you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
let's put the dot covers on just so you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.880 
let's put the dot covers on just so you
can<00:02:50.000> see<00:02:50.180> exactly<00:02:50.510> how<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.080> know<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.680> looks

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
secondary microphone so there we go so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.240 
secondary microphone so there we go so
let's<00:02:59.750> take<00:03:00.110> kind<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.470> once-over<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
let's take kind of a once-over at the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.949 
let's take kind of a once-over at the
case<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.700> can<00:03:01.819> see<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> bottom<00:03:02.510> there's

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
case you can see on the bottom there's

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.630 
case you can see on the bottom there's
one<00:03:03.230> large<00:03:03.500> cutout<00:03:03.860> for<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> 30-pin<00:03:04.580> dock

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
one large cutout for the 30-pin dock

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.130 
one large cutout for the 30-pin dock
connector<00:03:04.819> which<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.450> know<00:03:05.510> I've<00:03:05.690> covered<00:03:05.959> by

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
connector which I know I've covered by

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 
connector which I know I've covered by
that<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.800> nice<00:03:07.190> port<00:03:07.610> cover<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.180> then

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
that that nice port cover and then

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.030 
that that nice port cover and then
individual<00:03:08.989> cutouts<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.560> speaker<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
the microphone and there's what I was

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.300 
the microphone and there's what I was
talking<00:03:11.930> about<00:03:11.959> how<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.739> port<00:03:13.130> cover

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
talking about how this port cover

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
talking about how this port cover
matches<00:03:13.580> exactly<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.510> texture<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.530> lines<00:03:15.829> of

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
matches exactly the texture the lines of

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.490 
matches exactly the texture the lines of
the<00:03:16.700> case<00:03:16.880> itself<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:17.540> really<00:03:17.570> like<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.230> nice

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
the case itself I really like that nice

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.340 
the case itself I really like that nice
touch<00:03:18.799> on<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.220> side<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.630> see<00:03:20.810> individual

the headset jack cover matches up with

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.800 
the headset jack cover matches up with
those<00:03:37.040> lines<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.640> like<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.299> it's<00:03:38.570> cut<00:03:38.780> out

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
those lines I like that and it's cut out

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.870 
those lines I like that and it's cut out
perfectly<00:03:39.320> for<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.100> secondary<00:03:40.609> microphone

a<00:03:43.310> nice<00:03:43.579> raised<00:03:43.880> nub<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.480> gives<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.720> very<00:03:45.049> nice

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
a nice raised nub it gives you very nice

feedback when you press it it fires

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.599 
feedback when you press it it fires
quite<00:03:47.480> easily<00:03:47.660> every<00:03:48.260> time<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:49.160> far<00:03:49.370> as<00:03:49.489> the

of lay on the table design but you still

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.060 
of lay on the table design but you still
get<00:03:53.870> some<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.350> don't<00:03:54.680> think<00:03:54.829> you'll<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:55.010> a

problem when you lay this down screen
side<00:03:56.780> first<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:57.350> then<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.340> back<00:03:58.519> you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
side first and then there's the back you

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.509 
side first and then there's the back you
can<00:03:59.239> see<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.570> frosted<00:04:00.200> matte<00:04:00.470> back<00:04:00.829> allows

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
can see that frosted matte back allows

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.520 
can see that frosted matte back allows
all<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.060> iPhone<00:04:02.480> information<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.290> shine

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
all that iPhone information to shine

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.699 
all that iPhone information to shine
through<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:04.130> then<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.549> large<00:04:04.940> cutout<00:04:05.299> for<00:04:05.630> the

notice when I didn't have the phone in

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.979 
notice when I didn't have the phone in
there<00:04:10.160> there's<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.700> black<00:04:11.000> ring<00:04:11.420> around<00:04:11.780> there

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
there there's a black ring around there

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.140 
there there's a black ring around there
and<00:04:12.200> that's<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.769> help<00:04:12.980> with<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.370> LED<00:04:13.760> flash

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
and that's the help with the LED flash

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.569 
and that's the help with the LED flash
from<00:04:14.989> it<00:04:15.290> washing<00:04:15.769> out<00:04:15.920> as<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.459> know

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
from it washing out as it you know

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.029 
from it washing out as it you know

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
bounces back off the lens it's not loose

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.399 
bounces back off the lens it's not loose
this<00:04:19.370> kind<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.729> reminds<00:04:20.000> me<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.209> TPU<00:04:20.690> even

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
this kind of reminds me of TPU even

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.320 
this kind of reminds me of TPU even
though<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.530> know<00:04:21.650> it's<00:04:21.859> not<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.120> know<00:04:23.210> it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
though I know it's not it you know it

corners<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.600> iPhone<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.470> quite<00:04:26.800> nicely

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
corners of the iPhone for quite nicely

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.520 
corners of the iPhone for quite nicely
so<00:04:27.640> let's<00:04:28.150> slap<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> black<00:04:28.930> one<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.350> can

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
so let's slap on the black one so I can

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.920 
so let's slap on the black one so I can
show<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.710> how<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.250> one<00:04:30.430> looks<00:04:30.640> as<00:04:30.850> well<00:04:31.120> so

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
show you how that one looks as well so

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.930 
show you how that one looks as well so
here's<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.260> black<00:04:32.440> version<00:04:32.940> installation

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
here's the black version installation

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.760 
here's the black version installation
you<00:04:34.180> know<00:04:34.300> obviously<00:04:34.720> exactly<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.380> same<00:04:35.590> way

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
you know obviously exactly the same way

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.370 
you know obviously exactly the same way
so<00:04:36.040> there<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.390> port<00:04:37.630> cover<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:38.020> there<00:04:38.200> and

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
so there is the port cover in there and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.530 
so there is the port cover in there and
then<00:04:38.470> let<00:04:38.560> me<00:04:38.650> get<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.950> headset<00:04:39.880> jack<00:04:40.090> cover

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
then let me get the headset jack cover

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.080 
then let me get the headset jack cover
in<00:04:40.990> there<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:44.070> there<00:04:45.070> we<00:04:45.220> go<00:04:45.400> still<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:45.970> that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
in there and there we go still have that

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.850 
in there and there we go still have that
everything<00:04:46.480> else<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.780> same<00:04:46.960> same<00:04:47.320> black<00:04:47.590> ring

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
everything else the same same black ring

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.650 
everything else the same same black ring
and<00:04:48.010> there<00:04:48.130> same<00:04:48.430> cut<00:04:48.730> out<00:04:48.880> all<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.390> port

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
and there same cut out all the port

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.360 
and there same cut out all the port
cutouts<00:04:50.050> are<00:04:50.290> exactly<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.770> same<00:04:50.980> on<00:04:51.220> both

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
cutouts are exactly the same on both

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.490 
cutouts are exactly the same on both
versions<00:04:51.640> one<00:04:52.450> thing<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.780> notice<00:04:53.050> about<00:04:53.350> the

versions one thing I do notice about the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.260 
versions one thing I do notice about the
black<00:04:53.680> version<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.670> has<00:04:54.820> kind<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.150> an

black version is it has kind of an

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.000 
black version is it has kind of an
injection<00:04:55.600> point<00:04:56.080> where<00:04:56.320> they<00:04:56.440> made<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.860> case

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
injection point where they made the case

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.430 
injection point where they made the case
you<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.060> white<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.360> has<00:04:58.480> it<00:04:58.660> as<00:04:58.750> well<00:04:58.900> you

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
you the white one has it as well you

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.110 
you the white one has it as well you
just<00:04:59.620> notice<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.160> little<00:05:00.310> bit<00:05:00.460> more<00:05:00.700> on<00:05:00.910> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
just notice it a little bit more on the
