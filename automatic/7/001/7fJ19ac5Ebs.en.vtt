00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.589 
blocky a bit more with so I think yeah I
mean<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.829> think<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.429> like<00:01:52.639> guys<00:01:52.880> realize<00:01:53.359> like

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
mean I think it's like guys realize like

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.599 
mean I think it's like guys realize like
it's<00:01:53.929> a<00:01:54.079> little<00:01:54.200> bit<00:01:54.439> easier<00:01:54.859> takes<00:01:55.249> a<00:01:55.399> lot<00:01:55.579> off

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
it's a little bit easier takes a lot off

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.089 
it's a little bit easier takes a lot off
the<00:01:55.969> load<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.389> like<00:01:56.539> having<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.959> work<00:01:57.229> work

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
the load of like having to work work

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.870 
the load of like having to work work
your<00:01:58.159> board<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.700> hard<00:01:58.939> on<00:01:59.109> average<00:02:00.109> wave<00:02:00.380> so

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
your board is hard on average wave so

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.909 
your board is hard on average wave so
it's<00:02:01.880> nicer<00:02:02.299> when<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.599> kind<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.929> is<00:02:03.139> simple<00:02:03.739> and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:03.919 
it's nicer when it kind of is simple and

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.249 
it's nicer when it kind of is simple and
it's<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:04.819> still<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.239> speed<00:02:05.599> and<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.989> boards

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
it's you still have speed and the boards

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.230 
it's you still have speed and the boards
are<00:02:06.380> still<00:02:06.590> created<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.310> do<00:02:07.489> high-performance

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
are still created to do high-performance

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.749 
are still created to do high-performance
maneuver<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.350> works<00:02:09.530> both<00:02:09.649> ways<00:02:09.979> sweet

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
maneuver so it works both ways sweet

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.030 
maneuver so it works both ways sweet
thin<00:02:11.150> system<00:02:11.600> choice<00:02:12.320> yeah<00:02:12.830> I've<00:02:12.920> been

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
thin system choice yeah I've been

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.270 
thin system choice yeah I've been
rocking<00:02:13.340> future

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
rocking future

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.830 
rocking future
right<00:02:14.430> anywhere<00:02:14.790> from<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.450> know<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> am

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

to stick with this or you're going to do

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.340 
to stick with this or you're going to do
a<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:32.970> step<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.510> version<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.959> I'll

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
a little step up version of that I'll

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
a little step up version of that I'll
probably<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.310> go-to<00:02:36.030> kind<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
probably be on like my go-to kind of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.130 
probably be on like my go-to kind of
normal<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.170> bored<00:02:37.470> 60<00:02:38.130> ish<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.840> 18<00:02:39.840> five

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
normal or bored 60 ish and 18 five

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.660 
normal or bored 60 ish and 18 five
eighths<00:02:40.410> two<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.920> three<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
eighths two and three a it's kind of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.229 
eighths two and three a it's kind of
just<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.230> more<00:02:43.850> little<00:02:44.850> more<00:02:44.910> tighter

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
just a little more little more tighter

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.199 
just a little more little more tighter
turns<00:02:46.040> stuff<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.700> mean<00:02:48.060> you're

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
turns stuff like that I mean you're

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.490 
turns stuff like that I mean you're
looking<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:49.050> bigger<00:02:49.260> wave

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
looking for a little bit bigger wave

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740 
looking for a little bit bigger wave
head<00:02:49.830> high<00:02:50.010> range<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.700> kind<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.540> more

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
head high range so kind of have more

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
head high range so kind of have more
speed<00:02:52.200> which<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.070> really

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
speed which you don't have to really

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880 
speed which you don't have to really
create<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.209> much<00:02:54.390> speed<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.019> kind<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.380> you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
create as much speed so it kind of you

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.259 
create as much speed so it kind of you
just<00:02:56.070> want<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.310> board<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.760> most<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.090> work

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
just want your board to do most of work

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.690 
just want your board to do most of work
to<00:02:58.110> echo<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.320> good<00:02:58.500> job<00:02:58.709> simple<00:02:59.190> wish<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.459> luck
