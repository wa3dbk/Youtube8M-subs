like a sponge rubber in there and you

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.440 
like a sponge rubber in there and you
want<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.540> dry<00:03:07.840> before<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.470> plan<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.450> the

driving attention behind before a
primacy<00:03:18.570> as<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.630> say<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.380> where<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.739> water

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
primacy as I say this is where the water

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.340 
primacy as I say this is where the water
leaks<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.489> three<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:22.180> old<00:03:22.510> carrier<00:03:23.080> here

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
leaks and three this old carrier here

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.479 
leaks and three this old carrier here
it's<00:03:23.590> bolted<00:03:23.920> on

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
it's bolted on

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.750 
it's bolted on
but<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> Vasile<00:03:25.660> behind<00:03:26.049> I've<00:03:26.830> chosen<00:03:27.489> three

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
but the Vasile behind I've chosen three

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.080 
but the Vasile behind I've chosen three
as<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> say<00:03:28.540> runs<00:03:28.959> down<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.440> panel<00:03:29.830> here<00:03:30.090> into

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
as I say runs down this panel here into

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.789 
as I say runs down this panel here into
this<00:03:31.209> rubber<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.810> three<00:03:32.080> endeared<00:03:32.500> or

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
this rubber and three endeared or

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.770 
this rubber and three endeared or
so<00:03:33.130> picking<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> sealant<00:03:34.330> right<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.600> there

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
so picking the sealant right in there

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.479 
so picking the sealant right in there
hopefully<00:03:35.230> she<00:03:35.410> cured<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:35.890> dead<00:03:36.100> working<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
hopefully she cured it dead working the

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.310 
hopefully she cured it dead working the
other<00:03:36.580> Sade<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.330> one's<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.630> started

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
other Sade this one's just started

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.990 
other Sade this one's just started
recently<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.250> she'd<00:03:39.489> put<00:03:39.640> have<00:03:39.760> stopped

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
recently and that she'd put have stopped

recently and that she'd put have stopped
it<00:03:40.180> these<00:03:41.080> little<00:03:41.260> catches<00:03:41.850> makes<00:03:42.850> your<00:03:43.150> feed

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
it these little catches makes your feed

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.810 
it these little catches makes your feed
break<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.680> you'd<00:03:44.920> be<00:03:45.070> veins<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.580> might<00:03:45.730> be

break and so you'd be veins the might be
bankable<00:03:46.330> before<00:03:46.750> starting<00:03:47.200> make<00:03:47.860> sure<00:03:48.100> the

bankable before starting make sure the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.039 
bankable before starting make sure the
rubbers<00:03:48.549> are<00:03:48.730> back<00:03:48.910> on<00:03:49.090> them<00:03:49.299> when<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.720> insert
