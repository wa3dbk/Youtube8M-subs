00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 after it came back to the west of the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.620
 Paris region now see to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.600
 east of the capital 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.550
 the example of the district of belleville to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 paris in this neighborhood and christine 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.130
 Bravo was a teacher for four 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.349
 years 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 today she writes in the press 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.359
 she just published a book at 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 ramsay a master book in belleville 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.170
 that's why we asked 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.029
 christine bravo to return to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.650
 benches of her school where she is in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.210
 this moment in the company of al ahmar 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 how did this return to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 belleville this morning very well very well 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 gerard we actually think that there 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 might have had some minor problems 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 here in belleville because you know 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.760
 that basically in this school he 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 y to over 80% of migraines but that's 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.059
 relatively it went relatively well 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 happened so this morning we find ourselves 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.000
 here of course you said it because 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 we have at our side 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 christine bravo who was so here 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.370
 teacher who is now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 reporters she writes chronicles 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 especially at liberation she comes from 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 publish the heavy age you have 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.570
 shown earlier and so it is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 there with me to comment on the images 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
 that we shot with the means hf 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 this morning we will see them 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 right away from everything but to return is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 my return to belleville which has me the most 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.299
 Mark 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 first of all because of that of the exoticism of 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 colors of smells are not expected to be 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 disoriented overnight in the open 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
 paris good belleville right now that's 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 been the caricature it must be said a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 list of effective 30 not impossible to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.270
 remember preferably me that made me 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.070
 smile good I wondered if 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 I had not been seconded to Africa to my 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.909
 Blindly I insist on it is true 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.130
 that at first I did not believe my eyes 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.140
 at the same time I recognized the words 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.159
 because they have the same places the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.829
 Same services as anywhere else 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.450
 always so touching makuch then 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.329
 that's hell for the institts 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.740
 my words even that but in general 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.090
 we as a teacher we fight 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.750
 not to do the services that's true 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.240
 we wait weekly and today 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.100
 is still going because the kids are 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.619
 anesthetized by the event but after 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.700
 it's still the crowd the cry and the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.590
 race is still something 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.939
 very stressful on the first day of school and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.880
 and after the call the call is also 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.860
 hard enough one must spot the names do 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.420
 keep children calm and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 raise once we have the account 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.800
 so here too, it's okay to say 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.960
 after that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 it's the rush often in the year of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.340
 traffic jams on the stairs 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 except for the fittest institutes but there 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.710
 it's all quiet back to school 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.810
 to say that it's not the usual rhythm 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.740
 has not yet used to the nerves 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.290
 it's still after that it plays then 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.840
 good there you see them they are wise 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.550
 he feels the ground and pacified and have in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.460
 general we let them sit where they 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.780
 want and it's easier to know 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.470
 like that to whom we must separate at all 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:56.310
 next day price I know that sadistic but 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.240
 which is true by and large for me I know 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.340
 not that's pretty much the year 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.100
 last one ie well in the state so 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 it 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.380
 it's not easy but this city 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.530
 goes wrong in the hour is the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.530
 board 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.290
 calais 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.650
 left 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.760
 it seems to me that you have when 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.859
 even lived that way a little bit 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510
 original because in your book is going 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.760
 say you're talking about it very much 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.439
 original and it was an experience that 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.329
 was ultimately positive or not for 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.889
 you have been very positive but what 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.819
 is original it's not patent 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.139
 belleville that school was I want 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.030
 to say it's not because it was 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.980
 Belleville has it was original is 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.099
 because it's original to have told 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.159
 things like that that way that 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.189
 to my knowledge it does not have I ever 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.719
 read a book of teachers written by 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.069
 this way but it's not 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.560
 the originality of belleville 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.849
 actually it's true it's 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.469
 exotic and it's true that you have to 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.719
 to say it's true that it was the first 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:07.069
 time in my life that I took myself a 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 list with thirty names and 30 names 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.980
 strangers Thursday finally good I'm exaggerating in 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.540
 saying 30 because in addition I had not 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.699
 thirty children in my class the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.259
 classes have not been overloaded here not 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.810
 at all i mean i got really 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.060
 a class with a small staff 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.830
 no but precisely then some 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.150
 consider it's an enrichment that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.740
 to have immigrants not in his class 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.099
 and others that it's a handicap to the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.940
 for you and the péquistes paper is 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.320
 for me it was good it was 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.789
 rewarding because that was it 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.680
 was out of the ordinary and I had 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.690
 just fed up with the ordinary for 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.669
 it was still a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.630
 cultural enrichment because it's 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.820
 true that I learned a lot of things 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.409
 it's true that it's not obvious when 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.860
 we taught with benchmarks 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.270
 chronological christmas easter and all the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.800
 world is walking because you know what 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.960
 is the christmas tray was still 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.139
 it was the unknown it was and it was 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.030
 for me the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.439
 the great forgiveness the stuff the stuff 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.030
 I did not know but that's good 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.259
 it was still not 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.460
 the impression anyway that it's a 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.889
 little bit that a killer wharf is what 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 you tell if your caricature 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.479
 May 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.370
 not that much because what is 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.860
 caricature is the life of the school the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.199
 life of the class not so much life to 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.520
 belleville yes I say it speaks to you 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.639
 also of taboo of things which one 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.129
 finally speaking pretty little you had 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.270
 darlings for example I had a 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:30.599
 darling indeed the teachers 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.819
 do not readily admit the opposition 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.349
 I had a pet actually they 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.340
 so have all to the knowledge of the month 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.889
 because I say that I still have 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.990
 discussed with teachers we do not 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.069
 not willingly recognize because it's 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.870
 true it is not done here is gérard can 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.400
 say on this comeback to belleville which 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.949
 is a comeback despite all relatively 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.690
 original very well thank you to christine 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.800
 bravo who was mistress in belleville 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.060
 and who made it a book 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.060
 thank you I sign
