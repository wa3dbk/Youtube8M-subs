00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
the barrels then when you have to blend

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.779 
the barrels then when you have to blend
them<00:05:22.450> yeah<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.560> kinda<00:05:23.800> have<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:23.950> be<00:05:24.250> able<00:05:24.550> to

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
them yeah you kinda have to be able to

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.390 
them yeah you kinda have to be able to
recognize<00:05:25.510> whatever<00:05:26.500> there's<00:05:26.770> in<00:05:26.950> here<00:05:27.190> and

carbonated native language to the food

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.450 
carbonated native language to the food
line<00:05:43.060> makes<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.389> all<00:05:44.010> maybe<00:05:45.010> because<00:05:45.310> there

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
line makes and all maybe because there

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.920 
line makes and all maybe because there
are<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.550> little<00:05:45.639> more<00:05:45.760> complex<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.510> then<00:05:46.780> they

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
are a little more complex and then they

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.409 
are a little more complex and then they
have<00:05:47.110> more<00:05:47.320> tartness<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:48.400> this<00:05:48.550> as<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.880> session

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
have more tartness but this as a session
