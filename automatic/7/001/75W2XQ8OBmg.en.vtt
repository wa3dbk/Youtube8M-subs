00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 so people welcome to the new 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.389
 video express woman here we learn 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.009
 today with the stairs that recently learned 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.009
 technology much fun cloudy 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.189
 not the first sentence but now 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 right away the heavy set of 230 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.680
 the third disc from the inside out 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.989
 see is true of the 25-slice of 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.190
 Reach all 20 trap at about 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.570
 about 20 yes you have it here now 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.339
 I have knee bandage 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.170
 I just because of the sparing because 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.750
 I simply noticed its noblest of 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.350
 currently the weight is extremely difficult 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.629
 move 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.210
 I just take care of that when 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.519
 So your problem loses that in general 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 sometimes on bacon is for me 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.260
 not so important in the exercise if you 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.699
 of course, have weight in school 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.199
 of course, everything allows even 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.960
 a little bit easier i have 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.660
 Not changed because I think so 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.970
 it works the same way then I reduce 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.600
 Of course the weight is 220 slices 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.450
 away and important is right now 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.200
 at cross lifting proper learn us 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.149
 of course one 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.989
 the angle between the knee joint and 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.830
 hips so deep as long as possible 

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:29.929
 the po and otherwise only once again 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.500
 So pumping two sets heavy 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.060
 work out and then pump through how to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.550
 the now the case thus sees a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.729
 touch and go 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.849
 Of course you can pause but this 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.929
 It is easy for the 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.300
 fastest muscles 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.700
 if you also with the corresponding 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.420
 train why I just want it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.220
 train ourselves to fillinger us 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.610
 of course with a tree, too 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.569
 long periods of rest heavy work 34 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.489
 minutes and otherwise pause 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.289
 full forms of movement also sees the 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.810
 concentration from sentence to sentence 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.340
 Now I have reduced 20 here again 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.310
 and he sees proof here that is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 really a 25 slice is the 25 and 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.459
 20 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.129
 the olympic just look in this 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.239
 job very same looking minimal 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.830
 ticker and yes so I have to say it was 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.660
 really a good day too in the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.190
 preparation and sees this too 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.020
 Schnack and not forward anymore 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 it was always with me over stretch 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.290
 was complained of course, too 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
 learned a little bit about it 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.480
 but for me that was easy 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 strengthen construction of the ordinary back 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.650
 is simply optimally a bit too 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.470
 overreaching more important is the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.110
 Targeting the eyes so always 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.270
 where then head also 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.500
 behind the head or in the then 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.530
 led where the eyes hills and then the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.880
 extension of the spine up the stairs 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.400
 So here is the advantage of world production 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.020
 something and a decent just 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 So that's when you work 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.100
 Problems have impressed or 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.980
 Supplements handle with one 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.510
 ordinary long on the pole then on 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.800
 in any case try the stairs on 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.960
 I hope you have a little bit 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.420
 helped me if he like that 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.420
 shanks and corresponding channel 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.420
 subscribe are still a nice day
