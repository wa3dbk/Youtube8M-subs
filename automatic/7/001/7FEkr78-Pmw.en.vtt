the view that don't just stand there and
block<00:02:24.440> your<00:02:24.740> attack<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.880> kind<00:02:26.030> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
block your attack so you just kind of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.370 
block your attack so you just kind of
need<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.390> keep<00:02:26.540> hammering<00:02:26.810> them<00:02:27.020> on<00:02:27.230> them

also have to liberally use this dodge
maneuver<00:02:37.580> which<00:02:37.730> basically<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.120> involves

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
maneuver which basically just involves

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.150 
maneuver which basically just involves
you<00:02:38.600> holding<00:02:38.959> down<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.170> button<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.890> then

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.310 
the most frustrating thing about
spider-man<00:03:29.880> 3<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.360> camera<00:03:30.840> system<00:03:31.200> at

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
spider-man 3 is the camera system at

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.290 
spider-man 3 is the camera system at
times<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.950> borders<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.400> broken<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.240> the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
times it borders on broken but for the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.810 
times it borders on broken but for the
most<00:03:33.450> part<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.080> kind<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.350> annoying

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
most part it's just kind of annoying

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.460 
most part it's just kind of annoying
when<00:03:35.820> you're<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.060> combat<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.660> can't<00:03:37.020> snap<00:03:37.320> it

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
when you're in combat you can't snap it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.810 
when you're in combat you can't snap it
behind<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.920> at<00:03:38.010> any<00:03:38.130> given<00:03:38.370> point<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.700> you're

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
behind you at any given point so you're

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.370 
behind you at any given point so you're
constantly<00:03:39.240> having<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.660> adjust<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.140> camera

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
constantly having to adjust the camera

have to circle them and that gets really

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.010 
have to circle them and that gets really
annoying<00:03:44.420> anytime<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.570> swinging<00:03:45.900> around

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
annoying anytime you're swinging around

over the place gets very nauseating and
really<00:03:58.470> tends<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.190> make<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.460> whole<00:03:59.640> game<00:03:59.880> very

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
really tends to make the whole game very

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.140 
really tends to make the whole game very
very<00:04:00.690> frustrating<00:04:01.670> apart<00:04:02.670> from<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.880> scope

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
very frustrating apart from the scope

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.400 
very frustrating apart from the scope
and<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.390> look<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.780> city<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.230> game

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
and the look of the city the game

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.530 
and the look of the city the game
doesn't<00:04:04.620> really<00:04:04.860> look<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.340> great<00:04:05.700> the

look mildly deformed and kind of
freakish<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.430> lot<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.730> animation<00:04:12.120> in

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
freakish and a lot of the animation in

freakish and a lot of the animation in
the<00:04:12.390> game<00:04:12.600> well<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.140> like<00:04:13.380> some<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.710> moves

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
the game well it like some of the moves

the game well it like some of the moves
look<00:04:14.220> really<00:04:14.520> cool<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.000> actual<00:04:15.330> transition

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
look really cool the actual transition

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.750 
look really cool the actual transition
animations<00:04:16.500> between<00:04:16.920> them<00:04:17.160> look<00:04:17.459> really

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
animations between them look really

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
animations between them look really
stilted<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.359> weird<00:04:20.420> there's<00:04:21.420> all<00:04:21.510> sorts<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
little physics glitches that will pop up

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.530 
little physics glitches that will pop up
when<00:04:23.490> you're<00:04:23.580> fighting<00:04:23.790> guys<00:04:24.090> they'll<00:04:24.420> get

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
when you're fighting guys they'll get

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.090 
when you're fighting guys they'll get
stuck<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:24.930> walls<00:04:25.200> get<00:04:25.530> stuck<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.800> invisible

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
barriers that sort of thing and also the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.050 
barriers that sort of thing and also the
framerate<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.340> doesn't<00:04:29.550> really<00:04:29.700> hold<00:04:29.880> up

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
framerate just doesn't really hold up

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.850 
framerate just doesn't really hold up
very<00:04:30.090> well<00:04:30.360> in<00:04:30.600> either<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.810> xbox<00:04:31.260> 360<00:04:31.650> or

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
very well in either the xbox 360 or

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.530 
very well in either the xbox 360 or
playstation<00:04:32.370> 3<00:04:32.550> version<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.150> ps3<00:04:33.510> version

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
playstation 3 version so the ps3 version

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200 
playstation 3 version so the ps3 version
is<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> little<00:04:34.500> bit<00:04:34.650> worse<00:04:34.850> there's<00:04:35.850> also<00:04:36.000> some

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
is a little bit worse there's also some

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.430 
is a little bit worse there's also some
other<00:04:36.270> story<00:04:36.600> elements<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:36.960> spider-man

fighting<00:04:37.919> gangs<00:04:38.220> there's<00:04:38.669> actually<00:04:38.910> like<00:04:39.030> ten

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
fighting gangs there's actually like ten

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.120 
fighting gangs there's actually like ten
storylines<00:04:39.960> altogether<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.680> none<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:40.919> them

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130

really<00:04:41.340> tie<00:04:41.880> together<00:04:42.150> all<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:42.990> well<00:04:43.669> the

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
really tie together all that well the

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.040 
really tie together all that well the
whole<00:04:44.790> storyline<00:04:45.150> feels<00:04:45.510> like<00:04:45.720> kind<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:45.960> a

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
whole storyline feels like kind of a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.750 
whole storyline feels like kind of a
scattered<00:04:46.530> attempt<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.040> sort<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.520> tie<00:04:47.700> the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
scattered attempt to sort of tie the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.240 
scattered attempt to sort of tie the
movie<00:04:48.210> into<00:04:48.720> with<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.169> other<00:04:49.380> original
