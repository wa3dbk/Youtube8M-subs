let's get into the video so starting

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
let's get into the video so starting
with<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> beginning<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.850> turn<00:00:48.149> it's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
with the beginning of your turn it's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900 
with the beginning of your turn it's
very<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.320> important<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> prepare<00:00:50.070> correctly

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
very very important to prepare correctly

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
very very important to prepare correctly
because<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> moment<00:00:52.469> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
because this is really the moment that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.439 
because this is really the moment that
makes<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.129> breaks<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.730> turn<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
makes or breaks your turn and if you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
makes or breaks your turn and if you
prepare<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.079> correctly<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> mean<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
prepare it correctly that can mean that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.889 
prepare it correctly that can mean that
your<00:00:56.370> turn<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:57.000> balance<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.870> can

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
your turn to the off balance and you can

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
your turn to the off balance and you can
fall<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.680> hurt<00:00:58.829> yourself<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.280> that's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fall and hurt yourself and that's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
fall and hurt yourself and that's
definitely<00:00:59.940> something<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.719> want

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
definitely something that we don't want

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
definitely something that we don't want
