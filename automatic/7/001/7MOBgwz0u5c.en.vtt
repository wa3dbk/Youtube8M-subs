00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
when you go through you go through on

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.750 
when you go through you go through on
the<00:03:28.540> inside<00:03:28.709> down<00:03:29.709> through<00:03:30.010> here<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.549> you

the inside down through here and if you
look<00:03:31.000> under<00:03:31.299> here<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.530> can<00:03:32.709> run<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.980> wire

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
look under here you can run the wire

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.190 
look under here you can run the wire
down<00:03:33.459> here<00:03:33.819> through<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.120> double<00:03:34.599> hole<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.080> the

down here through a double hole in the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.220 
down here through a double hole in the
frames<00:03:36.360> make<00:03:37.360> sure<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.599> put<00:03:37.780> some<00:03:37.989> kind<00:03:38.110> of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
frames make sure you put some kind of

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.170 
frames make sure you put some kind of
tape<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> fabric<00:03:39.250> just<00:03:39.489> prevent<00:03:39.879> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
tape on the fabric just prevent the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.780 
tape on the fabric just prevent the
black<00:03:40.810> sticky<00:03:41.319> stuff<00:03:41.560> from<00:03:41.799> making<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.549> mess<00:03:42.730> of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
black sticky stuff from making a mess of

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.070 
black sticky stuff from making a mess of
the<00:03:43.180> fabric<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.290> little<00:03:44.860> hook<00:03:45.190> here

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.340 

for<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.950> whole<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.630> inner<00:03:50.630> cover<00:03:50.960> piece

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
for that whole is this inner cover piece

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.890 
for that whole is this inner cover piece
off<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:52.100> snap<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.610> back<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.570> gives<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
off just snap it back and that gives you

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.000 
off just snap it back and that gives you
more<00:03:54.080> room<00:03:54.260> underneath<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.650> as<00:04:00.770> you<00:04:00.830> can

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
more room underneath it so as you can

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.860 
more room underneath it so as you can
see<00:04:01.160> running<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.850> left<00:04:02.150> side<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:02.690> not<00:04:02.840> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
see running this left side it's not a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.030 
see running this left side it's not a
problem<00:04:03.200> because<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.590> run<00:04:03.770> everything

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
problem because you run everything

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.410 
problem because you run everything
through<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:05.140> around<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.290> side<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:07.420> did

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
through this to around this side I did

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.080 
through this to around this side I did
cut<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.840> little<00:04:09.080> slot<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> little<00:04:09.920> X<00:04:10.100> little<00:04:10.550> hole

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
cut a little slot a little X little hole

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.200 
cut a little slot a little X little hole
with<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.630> number<00:04:11.900> 11<00:04:11.990> exacto<00:04:12.770> blade<00:04:12.880> so<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:13.910> can

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
with a number 11 exacto blade so I can

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.009 
with a number 11 exacto blade so I can
actually<00:04:15.640> run<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.820> wires<00:04:17.030> down<00:04:17.600> through

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
actually run the wires down through

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.720 
actually run the wires down through
there<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.230> actually<00:04:18.440> cut<00:04:18.920> the<00:04:19.070> connector<00:04:19.580> off

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
there I actually cut the connector off

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.120 
there I actually cut the connector off
of<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.060> one<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:21.200> it's<00:04:21.380> easier<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.890> feed

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
of this one so it's easier to feed

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.400 
of this one so it's easier to feed
through<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.880> will<00:04:23.090> solder<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.900> back<00:04:24.140> on

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
through and I will solder this back on

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.960 
through and I will solder this back on
later<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:26.300> me<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:26.810> an<00:04:27.080> easier<00:04:27.650> road<00:04:27.940> okay

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
later to me this is an easier road okay

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.540 
later to me this is an easier road okay
this<00:04:29.390> raises<00:04:29.690> M<00:04:30.020> reassembling<00:04:30.890> in<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.220> reverse

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
this raises M reassembling in a reverse

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.700 
this raises M reassembling in a reverse
order<00:04:31.820> here<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.240> got<00:04:32.540> these<00:04:32.690> cited<00:04:33.080> pieces<00:04:33.470> here

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
order here I got these cited pieces here

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.430 
order here I got these cited pieces here
going<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.920> put<00:04:33.980> on<00:04:34.280> first<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.930> probably<00:04:36.320> this

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
going to put on first and probably this

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.180 
going to put on first and probably this
center<00:04:36.860> piece<00:04:38.500> followed<00:04:39.500> by<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.680> main<00:04:39.950> piece

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
center piece followed by the main piece

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.260 
center piece followed by the main piece
afterwards<00:04:42.160> ran<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.310> wire<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:43.790> way<00:04:44.000> I'm<00:04:44.150> not

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
afterwards ran the wire this way I'm not

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.790 
afterwards ran the wire this way I'm not
too<00:04:45.020> comfortable<00:04:45.470> about<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.340> but

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.899 

probable<00:04:52.729> word<00:04:52.909> for<00:04:53.210> now<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:55.310> right<00:04:55.550> side

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
probable word for now and the right side

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:04.480 
probable word for now and the right side
here<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.169> bit<00:04:57.379> of<00:04:57.470> a<00:05:03.039> vase<00:05:04.039> of<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.280> wires

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
here it's a bit of a vase of the wires

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.180 
here it's a bit of a vase of the wires
got<00:05:04.759> to<00:05:04.879> go<00:05:05.000> over<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.360> frame<00:05:05.599> piece<00:05:09.009> we'll<00:05:10.009> see

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
got to go over the frame piece we'll see

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.820 
got to go over the frame piece we'll see
how<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.430> works<00:05:11.319> here<00:05:12.319> now<00:05:12.440> we're<00:05:12.560> trying<00:05:12.680> to

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
how it works here now we're trying to

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.279 
how it works here now we're trying to
install<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.810> lower<00:05:14.810> reflector<00:05:15.590> LEDs<00:05:16.159> I<00:05:17.289> just

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
install the lower reflector LEDs I just

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.140 
install the lower reflector LEDs I just
removed<00:05:18.650> three<00:05:18.979> screws<00:05:19.370> from<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.639> interfere

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
removed three screws from the interfere

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.020 
removed three screws from the interfere
well<00:05:21.669> some<00:05:22.669> more<00:05:22.789> screws<00:05:23.210> underneath<00:05:23.479> here<00:05:23.990> I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
well some more screws underneath here I

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.550 
well some more screws underneath here I
think<00:05:26.030> this<00:05:26.180> is<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.360> bracket<00:05:26.629> I<00:05:26.900> need<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.199> remove

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
think this is a bracket I need to remove

00:05:27.560 --> 00:06:14.149 
think this is a bracket I need to remove
here<00:05:30.069> we'll<00:05:31.069> see<00:05:31.310> in<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> minute

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159
