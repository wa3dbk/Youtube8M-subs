sections put it into the gun and that's
it<00:03:37.370> once<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.549> get<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:38.880> thing<00:03:39.180> loaded<00:03:39.450> up<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:42.320> am

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
it once we get this thing loaded up I am

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.370 
it once we get this thing loaded up I am
finding<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.070> beef<00:03:44.310> jerky<00:03:44.340> loads<00:03:45.180> up<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
finding that the beef jerky loads up the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.630 
finding that the beef jerky loads up the
beef<00:03:46.680> loads<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.850> lot<00:03:48.060> easier<00:03:48.480> than<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
beef loads up a lot easier than the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.270 
beef loads up a lot easier than the
turkey<00:03:50.640> because<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.780> course<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.620> much<00:03:52.950> much

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
turkey because of course it is much much

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.970 
turkey because of course it is much much
drier<00:03:54.200> outside<00:03:55.200> than<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> chicken<00:03:55.709> because

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
drier outside than the chicken because

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.270 
drier outside than the chicken because
it's<00:03:56.040> much<00:03:56.370> much<00:03:56.579> drier<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:58.650> can<00:03:58.829> check<00:03:59.100> out

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's much much drier you can check out

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.930 
it's much much drier you can check out
my<00:04:00.260> dog<00:04:01.260> treats<00:04:01.709> which<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.070> make<00:04:02.280> from<00:04:02.579> which<00:04:02.820> I

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
my dog treats which I make from which I

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.990 
my dog treats which I make from which I
make<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.390> ground<00:04:04.320> chicken<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.790> can

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
make with a ground chicken and you can

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.630 
make with a ground chicken and you can
actually<00:04:06.420> do<00:04:06.629> this<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.110> suppose<00:04:07.340> with<00:04:08.340> lunch

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
actually do this I suppose with lunch

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.750 
actually do this I suppose with lunch
sure<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.970> could

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
sure you could

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.960 
sure you could
could<00:04:09.939> actually<00:04:10.120> do<00:04:10.569> this<00:04:11.310> using<00:04:12.310> ground

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
could actually do this using ground

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.170 
could actually do this using ground
ground<00:04:13.689> turkey<00:04:13.989> instead<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.560> beef<00:04:14.680> I've<00:04:15.670> heard

but dehydrated probably six to eight

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.719 
but dehydrated probably six to eight
hours<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:34.389> should<00:05:34.690> be<00:05:34.900> still<00:05:35.500> pliable<00:05:35.860> so

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
hours and it should be still pliable so

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
I will turn the dehydrator on and we'll

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.460 
I will turn the dehydrator on and we'll
come<00:06:06.729> back<00:06:06.940> once<00:06:07.419> it's<00:06:07.599> all<00:06:07.780> dehydrated<00:06:10.470> once

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
come back once it's all dehydrated once

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.800

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
you can tell when it's done because what

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.250 
you can tell when it's done because what
happens<00:06:16.419> is<00:06:16.690> when<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.530> bend<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:19.260> jerky

happens is when you bend the the jerky
it<00:06:20.469> will<00:06:21.159> Bend

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
it will Bend

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.240 
it will Bend
but<00:06:22.210> not<00:06:22.420> break<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.170> that<00:06:23.710> way<00:06:23.860> you<00:06:23.950> know<00:06:24.100> it's
