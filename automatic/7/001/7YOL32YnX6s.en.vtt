00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.469
 edition today I have another secret chest 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.730
 in skyrim but this time the secret chest 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.980
 is a chest that explodes I say this is 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.660
 something interesting something that turns out 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.520
 different no and because of this we have to go to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.520
 white but you know 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.160
 since we're thirsty walter we're going to 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.100
 direct towards the dragon switch if it's the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 where is the youth the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 white world 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.220
 ok since we are inside the dragon 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.590
 switch let's go to the next place well 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.500
 that you have to take this road 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:59.079
 w are the stairs and it is this 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.010
 room or room as you want to call 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.019
 very well now we enter and for the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.420
 next we need a plate of 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.290
 wood or those huge dishes that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.350
 you find at any restaurant table 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.300
 home of lezkairu to make the cliché 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.540
 to go through walls 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.670
 if you do not know how it's done here I have my 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.980
 past video of going through walls and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.380
 get a secret chest and there what 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.650
 they have so for this we are going to do 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 the same trick of traversing this wall 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.649
 to get to this secret chest 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.450
 and here I will try to see times here 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:42.360
 I saw it but it has failed 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.850
 so already several attempts we tried to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.240
 write down the occasion that I could achieve this 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240
 trick 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.850
 so you take the dish you put in this 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.610
 place tries to make the cliché of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.780
 traverse walls and as soon as through 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.340
 the pressure wall button 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.379
 drink 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.940
 fuck grab the chest and you're going to 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:16.240
 get here you 're going to see these objects 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.970
 to know what is called that a law does not 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.910
 you erase it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.290
 It is a chest that serves to save 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.959
 nothing 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.480
 it has nothing special but fleet gave a 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.800
 great drink is not something like a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.490
 curiosity or something that can serve you 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.690
 for 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.450
 and reach high places in Skyrim and already 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 you know it 's all about how to get this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 floating chest so remember that 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 depending on the place or asia where you are 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.020
 seeing the chest will face in 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.290
 different shapes can be in shape 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.360
 horizontal and ariel 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.460
 and so 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.980
 now it's up to you the way 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.360
 you are this chest so leave me in 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.590
 the comments 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.520
 what would be the special occasions 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.610
 for box envelopes or if the truth is 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.400
 something stupid this 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.910
