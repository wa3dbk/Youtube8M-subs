going to be a little bit different but

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
going to be a little bit different but
the<00:00:18.690> cleaning<00:00:18.960> methods<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.500> pretty<00:00:19.619> much<00:00:19.859> the

that water really really clean and safe
for<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> fish<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
for the fish so we go in there and we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
for the fish so we go in there and we
clean<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.649> change<00:00:49.950> half<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> water<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
clean it we change half the water and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
clean it we change half the water and
clean<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.239> filter<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.960> shock<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> system

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
clean our filter or shock in the system

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
clean our filter or shock in the system
we<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.250> almost<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.910> harm<00:00:54.180> than<00:00:54.660> good

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
we could almost do more harm than good

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.260 
we could almost do more harm than good
by<00:00:55.170> cleaning<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.649> fish<00:00:55.829> tanks<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> key<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
by cleaning our fish tanks so the key is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
by cleaning our fish tanks so the key is
really<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.840> regular<00:00:58.320> maintenance<00:00:58.370> not<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
really to do regular maintenance not to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
really to do regular maintenance not to
wait<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> tanks<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.809> gets<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.350> really

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wait to the tanks it gets really really

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
wait to the tanks it gets really really
dirty<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.039> filtration<00:01:02.460> stops<00:01:02.879> working<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
dirty the filtration stops working the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
dirty the filtration stops working the
water's<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.930> cloudy<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.070> you're
