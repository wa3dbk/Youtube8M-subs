there's<00:04:42.810> how<00:04:43.050> many<00:04:43.200> moves<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> have<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.040> in

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
there's how many moves you have but in

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.590 
there's how many moves you have but in
relax<00:04:44.910> mode<00:04:45.000> there<00:04:45.240> are

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
relax mode there are

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.450 
relax mode there are
and<00:04:45.690> then<00:04:45.840> he<00:04:45.900> moves<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:46.710> basically<00:04:47.010> this<00:04:47.220> mode

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
and then he moves so basically this mode

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.920 
and then he moves so basically this mode
is<00:04:47.490> used<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:47.850> challenge<00:04:48.240> your<00:04:48.330> friends<00:04:48.390> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
is used to challenge your friends and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.560 
is used to challenge your friends and
say<00:04:49.080> hey<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.350> got<00:04:49.650> like<00:04:49.860> five<00:04:50.160> moves<00:04:50.490> try<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.390> be

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
say hey I got like five moves try to be

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.100 
say hey I got like five moves try to be
me<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:52.080> know<00:04:52.200> it's<00:04:52.620> pretty<00:04:52.740> cool<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.930> did

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
me you know it's pretty cool so it did

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.980 
me you know it's pretty cool so it did
add<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.560> little<00:04:55.680> extra<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:56.310> there<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:57.840> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
add that little extra on there so the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.540 
add that little extra on there so the
game<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.230> actually<00:04:58.500> pretty<00:04:58.830> fun<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.220> know<00:04:59.340> so

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
game is actually pretty fun you know so

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.040 
game is actually pretty fun you know so
basically<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.270> show<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.510> real<00:05:00.720> quick<00:05:00.780> you

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
basically I to show you real quick you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.650 
basically I to show you real quick you
just<00:05:01.200> move<00:05:01.500> these<00:05:01.740> over<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:03.300> keep<00:05:03.450> moving

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
just move these over just keep moving

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.210 
just move these over just keep moving
stuff<00:05:04.200> over<00:05:04.530> until<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.310> find<00:05:05.610> a<00:05:05.820> way<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:08.040> get

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
stuff over until you find a way to get

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.920 
stuff over until you find a way to get
each<00:05:08.520> one<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.850> those<00:05:09.000> things<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.630> here<00:05:09.870> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
each one of those things out of here and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.120 
each one of those things out of here and
then<00:05:10.050> basically<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.530> just<00:05:10.590> got<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.830> find<00:05:11.010> a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
then basically you just got to find a

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.800 
then basically you just got to find a
way<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.280> there's<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.640> direct<00:05:11.790> path<00:05:12.210> from<00:05:12.540> here

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
way so there's a direct path from here

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.360 
way so there's a direct path from here
to<00:05:12.990> there<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.210> how<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.450> play<00:05:16.370> we're

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
to there so that is how you play we're

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.680 
to there so that is how you play we're
just<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:17.670> to<00:05:17.700> write<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.150> out<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.480> 10

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
just going to write this out of 10

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.330 
just going to write this out of 10
points<00:05:19.410> real<00:05:19.740> quick<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.900> rating<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:22.890> three

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
points real quick the rating is three

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.910 
points real quick the rating is three
points<00:05:23.730> for<00:05:24.210> how<00:05:24.450> easy<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.320> use<00:05:25.350> two

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
points for how easy it is to use two

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.370 
points for how easy it is to use two
points<00:05:26.280> for<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.460> graphics<00:05:27.030> two<00:05:27.870> points<00:05:28.230> for

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
points for the graphics two points for

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.490 
points for the graphics two points for
the<00:05:28.440> leg<00:05:28.680> length<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.750> 3<00:05:30.750> points4<00:05:31.080> however

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
the leg length and 3 points4 however

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.750 
the leg length and 3 points4 however
addictive<00:05:32.100> it<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.990> ok<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.050> um<00:05:34.530> i<00:05:34.950> think<00:05:35.400> for

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
addictive it is ok so um i think for

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.460 
addictive it is ok so um i think for
easy<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.330> use<00:05:36.510> it's<00:05:36.750> probably<00:05:37.050> going<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.290> get<00:05:37.410> a

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
easy to use it's probably going to get a

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.560 
easy to use it's probably going to get a
two<00:05:37.800> out<00:05:37.950> of<00:05:37.980> three<00:05:38.310> because<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.330> pretty

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
two out of three because it is pretty

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.030 
two out of three because it is pretty
simple<00:05:39.900> on<00:05:40.140> what<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.380> have<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.830> but

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
simple on what you have to do but

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.830 
simple on what you have to do but
sometimes<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.730> does<00:05:41.880> get<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.090> little<00:05:42.270> hard<00:05:42.570> like

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
sometimes it does get a little hard like

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.080 
sometimes it does get a little hard like
some<00:05:43.080> levels<00:05:43.440> they<00:05:44.190> are<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.400> little<00:05:44.610> bit<00:05:44.850> hard

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
some levels they are a little bit hard

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.450 
some levels they are a little bit hard
so<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.330> is<00:05:45.510> going<00:05:45.690> two<00:05:45.990> out<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.170> three<00:05:46.460> two

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
so that is going two out of three two

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.100 
so that is going two out of three two
other<00:05:47.640> two<00:05:47.850> for<00:05:48.030> graphics<00:05:48.450> definitely<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
other two for graphics definitely the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.590 
other two for graphics definitely the
pretty<00:05:49.350> cool<00:05:49.530> graphics<00:05:49.980> I<00:05:50.250> mean<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.150> is<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.330> a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
pretty cool graphics I mean it is just a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.000 
pretty cool graphics I mean it is just a
puzzle<00:05:51.930> game<00:05:52.020> so<00:05:52.350> suppose<00:05:52.590> have<00:05:52.770> like

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
puzzle game so suppose have like

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.440 
puzzle game so suppose have like
insanely<00:05:53.430> nice<00:05:53.640> graphics<00:05:54.180> but<00:05:54.300> they're

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
insanely nice graphics but they're

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.540 
insanely nice graphics but they're
pretty<00:05:54.690> cool<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:54.930> know<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.080> like<00:05:55.370> then<00:05:56.370> also

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
pretty cool you know I like then also

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.140 
pretty cool you know I like then also
for<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.600> length<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.980> getting<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.790> two<00:06:00.000> out

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
for the length it is getting it two out

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.970 
for the length it is getting it two out
of<00:06:00.180> two<00:06:00.420> for<00:06:00.630> sure<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.140> would<00:06:01.380> probably<00:06:01.590> give<00:06:01.890> it

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
of two for sure I would probably give it

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.100 
of two for sure I would probably give it
a<00:06:02.010> 3<00:06:02.340> out<00:06:02.370> of<00:06:02.490> two<00:06:02.730> because<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.690> thing<00:06:03.900> is

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
a 3 out of two because this thing is

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.490 
a 3 out of two because this thing is
really<00:06:04.530> long<00:06:04.800> 2000<00:06:05.640> levels<00:06:05.760> guys<00:06:06.210> try<00:06:06.480> to<00:06:06.540> try

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
really long 2000 levels guys try to try

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.530 
really long 2000 levels guys try to try
to<00:06:07.560> beat<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.800> in<00:06:08.040> a<00:06:08.100> couple<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.400> weeks<00:06:08.540> all

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
to beat that in a couple of weeks all

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.420 
to beat that in a couple of weeks all
right<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.930> then<00:06:10.140> for<00:06:10.590> addictiveness<00:06:11.070> I'm

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
right and then for addictiveness I'm

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.560 
right and then for addictiveness I'm
going<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.670> give<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.940> two<00:06:12.090> out<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.270> three

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
going to give it a two out of three

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.030 
going to give it a two out of three
because<00:06:12.750> once<00:06:12.990> again<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.440> does<00:06:13.680> get<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.890> little

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
because once again it does get a little

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.770 
because once again it does get a little
hard<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:14.610> you<00:06:14.670> guys<00:06:14.820> might<00:06:15.180> not<00:06:15.330> want<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.630> play

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
hard and you guys might not want to play

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.080 
hard and you guys might not want to play
it<00:06:15.930> for<00:06:16.110> as<00:06:16.320> long<00:06:16.530> but<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.370> is<00:06:17.520> pretty<00:06:17.700> fun<00:06:18.000> if

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
it for as long but it is pretty fun if

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.820 
it for as long but it is pretty fun if
you're<00:06:18.240> good<00:06:18.420> at<00:06:18.540> puzzle<00:06:18.900> games<00:06:19.110> and<00:06:19.260> you're
