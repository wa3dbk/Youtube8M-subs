00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
about what some of the misconceptions

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.349 
about what some of the misconceptions
are<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> think<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:26.039> liposuction<00:00:26.359> well

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
are you think about liposuction well

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.970 
are you think about liposuction well
lots<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.529> easy<00:00:28.769> way

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
lots of people think it's an easy way

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
lots of people think it's an easy way
out<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> lose<00:00:30.929> weight

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
out you know just a way to lose weight

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
out you know just a way to lose weight
but<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.790> what

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
but it's really not I think what

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.990 
but it's really not I think what
liposuction<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.989> best<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:35.130> those<00:00:35.520> areas

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
liposuction is best for are those areas

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
liposuction is best for are those areas
that<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.360> matter<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.620> cannot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that no matter what you do you cannot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
that no matter what you do you cannot
get<00:00:38.160> rid<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.879> trouble<00:00:39.420> spots<00:00:39.719> isn't

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
get rid of right so trouble spots isn't

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
get rid of right so trouble spots isn't
that<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> whole<00:00:40.469> idea<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> eat

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that the whole idea of what do you eat

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
that the whole idea of what do you eat
well<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.660> exercise<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:44.489> weight

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
well you exercise you don't your weight

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
well you exercise you don't your weight
is<00:00:44.789> good<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.600> their<00:00:46.050> own<00:00:46.079> low

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
is good but they have their own low

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 
is good but they have their own low
spots<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.280> hips<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> thighs<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.030> love

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
spots the hips the thighs the love

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.700 
spots the hips the thighs the love
handles<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.079> can't<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.379> rid<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> them

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
handles you just can't get rid of them

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.900 
handles you just can't get rid of them
right<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.700> best

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
right so that's what it's really best

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.439 
right so that's what it's really best
for<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.180> right

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
for all right

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
for all right
so<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.750> does<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> work<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.760> liposuctions

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so how does it work because liposuctions

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
so how does it work because liposuctions
come<00:00:53.940> along<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> people

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
come along you know a lot of people

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
come along you know a lot of people
think<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> those<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.860> big<00:00:56.219> cannulas<00:00:56.760> but

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
think of those little big cannulas but

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.830 
think of those little big cannulas but
it's<00:00:57.270> changed<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> lot

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's changed a lot

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's changed a lot
it<00:00:58.109> changed<00:00:58.559> drastically<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it changed drastically you know the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
it changed drastically you know the
incisions<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.930> tiny<00:01:01.170> they're<00:01:01.590> two

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
incisions are tiny they're two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
incisions are tiny they're two
millimeters<00:01:02.550> sometimes<00:01:03.000> yzma<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.809> most<00:01:04.019> three

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
millimeters sometimes yzma if most three

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
millimeters sometimes yzma if most three
millimeters<00:01:04.920> tiny<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.400> incisions<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
millimeters tiny little incisions and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.000 
millimeters tiny little incisions and
fat<00:01:06.630> removal<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.200> very<00:01:07.409> similar<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
fat removal that's very similar to the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.230 
fat removal that's very similar to the
way<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.159> used<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.939> where<00:01:09.210> all

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
way it used to be but this is where all

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
way it used to be but this is where all
of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> technology<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.619> set<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
of the technology is really set in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
of the technology is really set in
because<00:01:11.610> before<00:01:11.760> liposuction<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.900> fat

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
because before liposuction was about fat

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
because before liposuction was about fat
removal<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.490> fat<00:01:14.939> removal<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
removal now it's about fat removal and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
removal now it's about fat removal and
skin<00:01:15.780> tightening<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.470> allows<00:01:16.770> us<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.189> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
skin tightening which allows us to do so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
skin tightening which allows us to do so
much<00:01:17.490> more<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.939> body<00:01:18.150> contouring<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
much more for body contouring and this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
much more for body contouring and this
is<00:01:19.170> where<00:01:19.350> whether<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.159> using<00:01:20.250> laser<00:01:20.640> or

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
is where whether you're using laser or

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
is where whether you're using laser or
ultrasound<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:22.080> radiofrequency<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.979> any<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
ultrasound or radiofrequency or any of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
ultrasound or radiofrequency or any of
the<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.490> technologies<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.119> typically

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the other technologies are typically

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.030 
the other technologies are typically
oftentimes<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.619> patients<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
oftentimes with my patients a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
oftentimes with my patients a
combination<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> those<00:01:26.909> approaches<00:01:27.450> allows

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
combination of those approaches allows

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
combination of those approaches allows
us<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.710> only<00:01:28.740> fat<00:01:29.310> removal<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.909> skin

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
us to get not only fat removal but skin

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
of the skin I use the skin tight laser

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
of the skin I use the skin tight laser
which<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> great<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.729> always<00:01:42.030> preface<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
right you find it when you combine when

amazing
often<00:02:13.320> think<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.710> patients<00:02:14.040> had<00:02:14.160> surgery

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
often think the patients had surgery

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
often think the patients had surgery
when<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.910> look<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> pictures<00:02:15.600> right<00:02:15.810> well

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
when I look at the pictures right well

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.090 
when I look at the pictures right well
we're<00:02:16.140> gonna<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.380> at<00:02:16.500> some<00:02:16.650> pictures<00:02:16.740> right

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
we're gonna look at some pictures right

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
we're gonna look at some pictures right
now<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.340> let's<00:02:17.490> put<00:02:17.610> up<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:17.730> before<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
now so let's put up some before and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.730 
now so let's put up some before and
afters<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.080> explain<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.650> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
afters and you can explain to what we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.950 
afters and you can explain to what we
have<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> love<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.780> that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
have here well I love that look at that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.840 
have here well I love that look at that
I<00:02:21.990> mean<00:02:22.140> there's<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.980> little<00:02:23.280> crease<00:02:23.550> there

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
I mean there's that little crease there

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.760 
I mean there's that little crease there
drives<00:02:24.660> people<00:02:25.050> crazy

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
drives people crazy

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.130 
drives people crazy
exactly<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.180> know<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.750> typically

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
exactly and you know it's typically

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.680 
exactly and you know it's typically
genetic<00:02:28.680> as<00:02:29.310> much<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.730> weight<00:02:29.910> related<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
genetic as much as weight related and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.050 
genetic as much as weight related and
the<00:02:31.410> skin<00:02:31.860> tightening<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.310> fat<00:02:32.460> removal<00:02:32.910> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the skin tightening and fat removal is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.940 
the skin tightening and fat removal is
fundamental<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> also<00:02:34.470> break<00:02:34.740> up

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
fundamental to it but I also break up

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.980 
fundamental to it but I also break up
that<00:02:34.980> adhesion<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:36.060> causing<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.690> role

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
that adhesion that's causing that role

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.470 
that adhesion that's causing that role
and<00:02:37.620> by<00:02:37.740> smoothing<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.490> contour<00:02:39.000> they

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and by smoothing out that contour they

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.510 
and by smoothing out that contour they
just<00:02:39.750> look<00:02:39.960> better<00:02:40.110> right<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.040> can't<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
just look better right you can't do that

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.770 
just look better right you can't do that
on<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> surface<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.240> really<00:02:42.450> need<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.690> go

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
on the surface you really need to go

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.450 
on the surface you really need to go
under<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.080> skin<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.620> right<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.160> a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
under the skin to do that right and a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.560 
under the skin to do that right and a
lot<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> people<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.210> when<00:02:45.360> they<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
lot of people get that when they just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.360 
lot of people get that when they just
get<00:02:45.690> older<00:02:46.080> too<00:02:46.290> right<00:02:46.800> they<00:02:47.010> don't<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
get older too right they don't have it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.950 
get older too right they don't have it
when<00:02:47.490> they're<00:02:47.580> young<00:02:47.700> necessarily<00:02:48.330> exactly

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
when they're young necessarily exactly

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.120 
when they're young necessarily exactly
all<00:02:49.110> right<00:02:49.260> let's<00:02:49.410> bring<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.710> next<00:02:49.950> one

pounds<00:04:22.070> well<00:04:22.430> there's<00:04:22.670> gonna<00:04:22.790> be<00:04:22.970> fat

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
pounds well there's gonna be fat

pounds well there's gonna be fat
deposited<00:04:23.870> somewhere<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.350> won't<00:04:24.440> be<00:04:24.620> there

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
deposited somewhere it won't be there

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.590 
deposited somewhere it won't be there
typically<00:04:25.220> it'll<00:04:25.400> be<00:04:25.520> somewhere<00:04:25.820> else<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:26.480> if

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
typically it'll be somewhere else but if

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.700 
typically it'll be somewhere else but if
you<00:04:26.660> typically<00:04:26.990> maintain<00:04:27.530> your<00:04:27.650> weight

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
you typically maintain your weight

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.040 
you typically maintain your weight
within<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.160> 10<00:04:28.340> pound<00:04:28.550> range<00:04:28.790> it's<00:04:29.450> it's<00:04:29.930> not

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
within a 10 pound range it's it's not

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.690 
within a 10 pound range it's it's not
gonna<00:04:30.230> cause<00:04:30.410> any<00:04:30.440> problem<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.310> idea<00:04:31.580> is

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
gonna cause any problem so the idea is

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.430 
gonna cause any problem so the idea is
that<00:04:31.730> if<00:04:32.030> you're<00:04:32.180> gonna<00:04:32.300> do<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.140> should<00:04:33.350> be

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
that if you're gonna do it it should be

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
that if you're gonna do it it should be
something<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.890> you're<00:04:33.980> going<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.160> maintain

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
something that you're going to maintain

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.160 
something that you're going to maintain
and<00:04:34.910> really<00:04:35.270> want<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.480> take<00:04:35.630> care<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.870> yourself

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
and really want to take care of yourself

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.600 
and really want to take care of yourself
in<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.350> future<00:04:36.470> but<00:04:36.710> it's<00:04:36.890> it's<00:04:37.190> not<00:04:37.310> weight

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
in the future but it's it's not weight
