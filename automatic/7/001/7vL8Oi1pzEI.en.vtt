tenets of the yacht system tell me what

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.430 
tenets of the yacht system tell me what
it<00:07:20.650> means<00:07:20.950> is<00:07:21.700> a<00:07:21.760> symbol<00:07:22.300> for<00:07:22.330> everyone<00:07:22.870> and<00:07:23.050> no

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
it means is a symbol for everyone and no

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.650 
it means is a symbol for everyone and no
one<00:07:23.470> and<00:07:23.980> then<00:07:24.640> there's<00:07:24.850> a<00:07:24.910> link<00:07:25.120> where<00:07:25.630> you

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.660

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
and then all I have to say about that is

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.790 
and then all I have to say about that is
 because<00:07:36.130> I<00:07:36.220> like<00:07:36.400> circles
