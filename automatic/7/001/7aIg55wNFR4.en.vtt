00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 so I said that I repair in 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 review on two products 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.010
 when must there be one that it does 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.190
 long embarrassed it's their five months but 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.320
 he had let go this week so what 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 I bought on a sense clues and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.050
 excuses masquerades ended in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 children's words I will go over too I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.990
 think it's water repellent so if i have 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.059
 took this island 57 to hat 6 and then 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 the child what attracts me here his brush 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.950
 I played everything tried 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 as you see like the vikes in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 fact but the only thing I like little 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 to sink national sic is mascara 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.969
 accumulate at the end what follows is going 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 never default all my blog 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 then m but it's a big hit and he 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.629
 knows rsa separates from the violin then 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.059
 bend down the spine machinery this rate is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 covered with his parents so it's not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.670
 it works the latter sense but with 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.260
 shit prefers to keep it off blah the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 day then it became yes but a 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.420
 little less ages place then the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 reason why I bought him because 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 that's the reason kids 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 it's been four months in a row that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 I bought in three games at their 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 place it's a game it's another one that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 saw him cheaper lenses from outside 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.869
 of dance have done so who is really going 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.270
 well done and he comes back draws like 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.580
 similÃ© covers the seats we know ourselves 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.820
 not because I always use there 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:53.700
 see the movie m6 is the dream but a little 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 less than the wide beaches then I like 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.010
 better why I like it better 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 wide place but I really like him 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.790
 but what do I like more 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.000
 holistic between fifteen and ten missiles 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.940
 and his supposedly violent passengers 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.530
 no more silence I advise you so 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.530
 my product 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 if peter grimes needed knicks 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.510
 dalphond is frozen at it's like five 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.040
 about month 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.240
 like the one in December I bought this 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.240
 who gave me two seconds 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.190
 I bought the plain folds so m I assure 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.550
 uniprix for the price I want to taste 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.960
 that's 5 99 that's for sure when I 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.750
 removed my sense we what is certain 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.420
 at this default if in the class an alarm clock 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.300
 because of the breakdown and 6 so there is 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.480
 pink blue black a white 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.850
 but fiat I had already done a review the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.470
 fim little milk as just an article 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.730
 on the world something I had 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.730
 before but all that changed my life 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.230
 changed I will explain why 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.220
 never stopped the colors but if I 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.600
 say childhood is not creams 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:39.650
 75th then I know but at home I decided 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.830
 to react but many times in fact 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.160
 yes it is a very good until the thickness 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.620
 from above it is like the driest 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 it's really like over which bryant 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.040
 walking the only one I had tested I thought 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.370
 not when everything is really cream 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.260
 said yes really sows me so I 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.380
 criticized that this is not true but 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.320
 in his celi pact for this thing that 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:08.750
 suffer from this partial in his this 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.680
 that I say it's partly true but in 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.680
 below if actually no 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.090
 we have passed but a sincere thank you 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.380
 butcher cergy complete teams outings and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.130
 the colors are really cemented 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.650
 I really like started then m 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.710
 I used a lot these days 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.010
 since she's still just my therapy 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.090
 doctor that really tells you where I 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.650
 can put the color test 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.780
 it's nice that the characters use 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.750
 with was drunk by concert what a 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:51.960
 only sponsor for him, but according to age 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:55.050
 precise and that of the izoard and I 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.770
 took 6 April to redeem on the 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.060
 dear all childhood ticket that's it 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.820
 also that go a lot of products 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.180
 unique and the palette like that I think 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.860
 that two 89.99 unpaid colors 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.420
 but what they see even more the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.670
 hardly what I bought when I 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.380
 ordered and the cause not using 21 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.169
 a color that is 12 of lens is 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.690
 really cheap servant as prenat 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.419
 these two here at pharmacies those who 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.640
 like a little more to a single floor than if 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.710
 you buy it on this one will not be it 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.230
 range of trades in keeping at 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:34.650
 the base corresponds to face of really the 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:39.240
 I barely js show you them your 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.050
 house in season may seem out 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.540
 camera but if I wanted to show on 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.310
 my blog I finished it's going to sound 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.890
 more because it is that the canteen my 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.250
 camera is bad I really 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.220
 solid 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.760
 but that's what we do like 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.240
 a lot 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.520
 I like it a lot then it allows 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.740
 easily by decided to associate myself with 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.320
 copy but me what I say a lot 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.490
 it's really Serbian part just admits 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:12.860
 to those I have now 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.880
 knowing what to do if yes eve go for m 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.000
 I tested without base then with Paul 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.680
 haggis 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.660
 if you buy it you are obliged 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.330
 to have a good base or a cool base 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.139
 because it is not a method that will 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.300
 in the crucible we had that's what I 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.430
 tested then it really was in the 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.039
 chrono but often trusted when 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.810
 I was struggling, but because 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:39.050
 I left the Swiss Valais here 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.810
 doubts and as I like here it's a 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.250
 little like these british facs and his 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.080
 will no more than inevitable then that has 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.360
 been in the regions that we thought 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.659
 a good base since it comes from 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.289
 worth I advise you so this would 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.289
 to have a good laugh
