00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.139 
there's there's a bunch of niches and a
lot<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.770> similarities<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
lot of similarities and I think that you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.760 
lot of similarities and I think that you
know<00:01:24.270> while<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
know while I think that's kind of the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.319 
know while I think that's kind of the
comparisons<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.670> made<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.180> we've

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
comparisons that get made to what we've

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.760 
comparisons that get made to what we've
done<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> we're<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.350> trying<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
done and we're really not trying to be

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
done and we're really not trying to be
those<00:01:28.890> other<00:01:29.070> games<00:01:29.250> we're<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.820> trying<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
those other games we're really trying to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.969 
those other games we're really trying to
be<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> social<00:01:30.659> party<00:01:30.899> game<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
be a social party game but we do have

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
be a social party game but we do have
you<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> core<00:01:33.000> elements<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you know we do have the core elements of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
you know we do have the core elements of
any<00:01:33.570> dansgame<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.380> battle<00:01:34.710> mode<00:01:34.920> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
any dansgame we have the battle mode we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
any dansgame we have the battle mode we
have<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.329> hot<00:01:36.719> top<00:01:36.960> tracks<00:01:37.289> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we have all the difficulty levels i'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
we have all the difficulty levels i'm
the<00:01:39.359> one<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.719> we<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:39.960> kind<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the one thing that we really kind of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
the one thing that we really kind of
focus<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> aside<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.969> social<00:01:42.329> aspect<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
focus on aside from the social aspect of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
focus on aside from the social aspect of
it<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.770> focus<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.159> ought<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> authenticity

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it as we focus on ought to authenticity

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
it as we focus on ought to authenticity
so<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> actual<00:01:46.350> artist<00:01:46.799> videos<00:01:47.039> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so we have the actual artist videos in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.679 
so we have the actual artist videos in
the<00:01:47.219> background<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.850> pull<00:01:48.090> choreography

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the background we pull choreography

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
the background we pull choreography
front<00:01:48.960> directly<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.409> those<00:01:49.590> videos<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
front directly from those videos and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
front directly from those videos and
then<00:01:50.609> also<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.539> have<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.719> fidelity

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
then also because we have the fidelity

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
then also because we have the fidelity
of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> PlayStation<00:01:52.740> Move<00:01:52.859> we're<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of the PlayStation Move we're really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
of the PlayStation Move we're really
looking<00:01:53.759> at<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.020> you

looking at not just are you are you
shaking<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.560> controller<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.429> moving<00:01:56.700> in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
shaking the controller are you moving in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
shaking the controller are you moving in
the<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.359> but<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> line<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the right way but you know the line and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
the right way but you know the line and
also<00:01:59.399> your<00:02:00.000> body<00:02:00.450> position<00:02:00.630> which<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
also your body position which is

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
also your body position which is
something<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.590> none<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.520> competition

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
something that none of the competition

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.580 
something that none of the competition
can<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.359> yeah<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.409> special

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
can really do yeah that's really special

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.200 
can really do yeah that's really special
so<00:02:04.920> does<00:02:05.039> it<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.579> camera<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
so does it just use the camera and the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.090 
so does it just use the camera and the
move<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.990> does<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.530> does<00:02:07.679> but<00:02:07.890> when

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
move then it does it does but when

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.070 
move then it does it does but when
you're<00:02:08.220> dancing<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.570> you're

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you're dancing you know it's you're

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.170 
you're dancing you know it's you're
always<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.619> motion<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> most<00:02:11.490> part<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
always in motion for the most part so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.550 
always in motion for the most part so
that's<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> nice<00:02:12.659> thing<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.170> move<00:02:13.379> if

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that's the nice thing about the move if

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
that's the nice thing about the move if
you<00:02:14.159> actually<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> game<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.180> dance

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you actually look at the game the dance

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.930 
you actually look at the game the dance
avatars<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> game<00:02:16.470> or

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
avatars in the game or

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.100 
avatars in the game or
holding<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.360> move<00:02:17.510> controller<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.020> what

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
holding the move controller and what

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.170 
holding the move controller and what
you're<00:02:18.290> scoring<00:02:18.770> against<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.250> actually<00:02:19.940> what

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you're scoring against is actually what

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
you're scoring against is actually what
you<00:02:20.420> see<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.720> see<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.020> screen<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.830> every

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
you see you see on screen so every

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.030 
you see you see on screen so every
little<00:02:22.940> subtle<00:02:23.360> nuance<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.930> every<00:02:24.350> motion

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
little subtle nuance and every motion

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.590 
little subtle nuance and every motion
that<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.340> dancer<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.790> making<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.450> they're

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
that the dancer is making if they're

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.000 
that the dancer is making if they're
just<00:02:26.630> kind<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.260> know<00:02:27.320> shaking<00:02:27.680> their<00:02:27.890> arm

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
just kind of you know shaking their arm

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.380 
just kind of you know shaking their arm
behind<00:02:28.190> them<00:02:28.550> or<00:02:28.670> traveling<00:02:29.090> across<00:02:29.270> the

behind them or traveling across the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.390 
behind them or traveling across the
dance<00:02:29.780> stage<00:02:30.020> all<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.770> stuff<00:02:30.980> gets<00:02:31.100> picked

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
dance stage all that stuff gets picked

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.040 
dance stage all that stuff gets picked
up<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.640> detected<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.420> reflected<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.960> your

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
up and detected and is reflected in your

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.810 
up and detected and is reflected in your
score<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.530> course<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> make<00:02:34.670> it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
score of course we don't want to make it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.490 
score of course we don't want to make it
so<00:02:35.030> difficult<00:02:35.360> that's<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:35.990> oh<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.290> god<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
so difficult that's like oh my god I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.080 
so difficult that's like oh my god I
can't<00:02:36.770> do<00:02:36.890> exactly<00:02:37.190> what<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.490> answers<00:02:37.910> doing

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
can't do exactly what this answers doing

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.660 
can't do exactly what this answers doing
so<00:02:38.630> there's<00:02:38.780> others<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.320> there<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.890> some<00:02:40.130> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
so there's others that there is some it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.180 
so there's others that there is some it
is<00:02:40.730> forgiving<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.140> know<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.500> essence<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
