00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so people are welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 Battlefield hotline and today I show 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.179
 you how to take was another gold 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.820
 free turns and the gold machete 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 and i call the order times or the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.619
 made the no life machete 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 because behind the order is really 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.529
 a lot of a lot of time 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 need to get the gold machete 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 We take the advance syndicate order 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 to lock 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.570
 and that is I say in contrast to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 Apply the other silicate relative 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.700
 simply not because it's fast 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.800
 or easy to do but because 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 We do not have two previous orders 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 you must know how to finish 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 Ground vehicle order 1 floor vehicle 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 occurred 2 and then comes the syndicate 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.590
 order no here is really everything 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 staged order in there for the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.600
 requirements in the zenith order the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.000
 yes, I'll tell you very directly 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.340
 just show it to you 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 requirements number one we have to 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.520
 10,000 kills with all primary and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 make secondary weapons 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 here is the german translation unfortunately 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.560
 a bit misleading because 10,000 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.060
 kids with all primary and secondary 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 One could think weapons now okay me 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.290
 must be with each primary weapon 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 and with each and every one of them 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 weapon that would make 10,000 kills 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.689
 Of course, a bit too exaggerated 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 no here it is enough if one with one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.460
 weapon reaches 10,000 kills then one has 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 the check mark as well as requirement number 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 we have two classes with all one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.680
 million points make classes 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 operator sniper mechanic enforcer and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 here too is the German translation 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.680
 a bit misleading because it's enough 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.570
 yes, a class is enough 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 class perfect and then we have 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.280
 as well as a check mark third condition 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.310
 for the progress syndicate order is 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 we have to with all vehicles 500,000 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
 earn points with all he also here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 It is enough even a vehicle it is enough 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 if you do that only with the heli or 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 only with the tank truck or only with 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.930
 the suv whatever it takes 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.430
 vehicle and then the checkmark is there 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.840
 also there when we do the three things 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 have completed the three 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.350
 Check it out and we'll turn it on 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 also the syndicate order free and we 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.280
 can see what the award 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.280
 precondition and that is only one 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.470
 single thing i know from the others 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.070
 syndicate videos and comments 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.170
 of you that many many so strong 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.370
 we have problems and we have to do that 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 call level 4 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.710
 for all four classes in one lot 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.780
 reach the eu level with the operator 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.820
 Four mechanics call the level 4 with the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.850
 n forster the call level 4 and with the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.190
 profi the reputation level 4 reach there 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.180
 two ways to do that 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.710
 may seem like many now 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 impossible and so on because many like 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.590
 you make the first one 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.970
 but I've been giving tips so often 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.250
 how it works 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.010
 So at least one is a round 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.930
 very easy actually the first 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.450
 possibility for console players but 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.430
 I think at the moment still relatively 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.320
 difficult because it is not 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.330
 Personalized server is hotwire 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.250
 driving hotwire driving on a server 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.440
 It was time with extremely high set 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.390
 is where there are extremely many tickets and 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.820
 then definitely not that here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.910
 tackle if you have no call bus because 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.560
 without a call boost that is yes it takes 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.990
 maybe too long to do that in one 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.120
 round creates hotwire with the call bus 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.890
 drive best as a passenger as 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.440
 In June, we take care of the car 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.990
 As a mechanic, fix the car 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.970
 as medien medi kit put on the car 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.030
 take out as sneijder and so on 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.040
 I know it's very much of here 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.950
 because of me on local server and so on 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.390
 but I'm always just picking it up 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.580
 not on nokia but because that is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.100
 I know since then I know 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.370
 There are already a million could 150er 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.080
 level 150s no statham and such 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.610
 but it can happen and that 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.980
 would be annoying so do it better 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.900
 do not try to reach it normally 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.480
 as I said on the pc with hotwire well 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.970
 counter at the time and so on is that yes 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.070
 This is actually quite good if you 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.810
 has a call bus in it because then it works 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.700
 actually then relatively fast 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.460
 then you should do that and the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.560
 second option now for 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.000
 console player beware yes transport 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.850
 heli flying in hot wire 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.650
 so you make an extremely many points because 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.390
 these cars are considered goals and the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.010
 are always marked and that you have to 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.169
 just fly from a to b and from 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.660
 bcc and so on go really fast 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.710
 my record for the fourth grade was 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.900
 under a minute 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.690
 and in no idea what it was 56 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.400
 or 58 seconds yes four steps in 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.260
 not even a minute that was mine 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.570
 record in hotmail with the transport heli 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.700
 and that too with the fat one 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.260
 boost that means here also a hundred 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.460
 It's best to have one 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.020
 it gets a little bit worse 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.760
 I think I'll be little if you do that 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.440
 want to do with all four classes 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.729
 So just pick a buddy or 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.100
 Colleagues give you your hotwire 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.110
 a little bit flies around and then that should be 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.729
 Actually, they are doing quite well now 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.290
 all the console players know 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.050
 not many tickets are in the field 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.729
 Call Bus is that extremely fast 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.140
 a possibility would be like me for that 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.630
 call me now always the call 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.280
 you did that with heli fly that 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.050
 that can be anyone and so on and so on 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.520
 Ateliers also said that you have to 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.710
 also first speak therefore say 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.120
 I transport yes it is easier in 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.400
 hawtai and so on but if you are good 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.590
 in heli page maccabi then he goes 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.060
 just in the fat rust briefly with 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.669
 every class flys in a bit 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.400
 good pilots do it then 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.810
 fast and it's just it 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.850
 I'm so sorry how should I do it differently 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.220
 express but with the transport tilly 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.320
 is it yes I say for people that 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.160
 not good teddy can fly clearly 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.229
 easier 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.330
 Those were the tips I gave you 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.040
 can be on the way if you are 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.990
 that you have then you have gold 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.580
 I unlocked today 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.630
 just a gold weapon just made 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.400
 For the reason you already see how long 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.169
 the video is now i wanted you 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.610
 give reasonable tips on how to do that 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.470
 unlock and that too reasonable 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.150
 explain why today only one gold 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.710
 Weapon we'll meet again tomorrow 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.970
 in the next video if you like this 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.780
 a video like I would my 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.240
 thumbs up 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.740
 a like to look forward to us tomorrow 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.740
 again until tomorrow and bye
