the<00:00:48.870> pattern<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.550> thought<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.789> seen

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the pattern and i thought i had seen

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.020 
the pattern and i thought i had seen
that<00:00:51.210> somewhere<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.840> i<00:00:51.899> wasn't<00:00:52.199> mistaken

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.960 
and thoughts and furthermore to see if
we<00:03:42.890> can<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.310> bottom<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
we can get to the bottom of this and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.900 
we can get to the bottom of this and
actually<00:03:44.209> say<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.650> linked<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.550> i

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
actually say this is linked to that I i

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.790 
actually say this is linked to that I i
really<00:03:47.600> think<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.080> these<00:03:48.320> two<00:03:48.530> are<00:03:48.560> linked

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
really think that these two are linked

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.870 
really think that these two are linked
together<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.459> would<00:03:49.550> be<00:03:49.670> really

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
together and it would be really

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.790 
together and it would be really
interesting<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.360> find<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.320> I<00:03:51.500> guess<00:03:51.680> I

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
interesting to find out and I guess I

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.110 
interesting to find out and I guess I
