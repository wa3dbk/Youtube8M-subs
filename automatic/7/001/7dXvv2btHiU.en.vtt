build is available on both of my devices

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.630 
build is available on both of my devices
so<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.630> animation<00:00:36.930> action

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
so you can see the animation action

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.799 
so you can see the animation action
apart<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> talk<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.540> your

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
apart from that if you talk about your

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
apart from that if you talk about your
changes<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> file

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
changes then you can see this file

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
changes then you can see this file
explorer<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.910> has<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:43.649> icon<00:00:45.289> but

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
explorer now has got a new icon but

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.100 
explorer now has got a new icon but
again<00:00:47.160> apart<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.270> try<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
again apart from that we try we go and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
again apart from that we try we go and
my<00:00:49.410> Start<00:00:50.039> screen<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.850> any

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
my Start screen you will not see any

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600 
my Start screen you will not see any
change<00:00:51.559> there<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.829> interesting<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
change there is one interesting and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.560 
change there is one interesting and
unique<00:00:54.210> feature<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.300> found<00:00:57.300> out

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
unique feature that we just found out

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.689 
unique feature that we just found out
while<00:00:58.469> doing<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.800> hands-on<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> build

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
while doing a hands-on with this build

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.820 
while doing a hands-on with this build
so<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> double<00:01:00.989> tap<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> can

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
so if you double tap here you can

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
so if you double tap here you can
collapse<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.159> Action<00:01:06.000> Center<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.540> double

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
collapse the Action Center and double

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929 
collapse the Action Center and double
tapping<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.799> obviously<00:01:08.189> expand<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> Action

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
tapping will obviously expand the Action

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.190 
tapping will obviously expand the Action
Center<00:01:09.920> tap<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.159> collapse<00:01:11.869> double<00:01:12.869> time<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
Center tap to collapse double time to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
Center tap to collapse double time to
expand<00:01:15.170> good<00:01:16.170> news<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> swipe<00:01:17.159> down<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
expand good news is that swipe down to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
expand good news is that swipe down to
expand<00:01:18.210> Action<00:01:18.479> Center<00:01:18.750> still<00:01:18.960> works<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.470> now

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
expand Action Center still works but now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.550 
expand Action Center still works but now
you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.810> cool<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.290> actually

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you have a pretty cool way to actually

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.550 
you have a pretty cool way to actually
collapse<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.780> i<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.380> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
collapse it as well so i think this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
collapse it as well so i think this
feature<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:26.040> obviously<00:01:26.369> unlisted<00:01:29.090> talking

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
feature was obviously unlisted talking

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
feature was obviously unlisted talking
about<00:01:30.299> other<00:01:30.509> changes<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.590> battery

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
about other changes like this battery

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
about other changes like this battery
saver<00:01:32.189> has<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.549> new<00:01:32.909> icon<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
saver has got new icon here that you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.300 
saver has got new icon here that you can
see<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> changes<00:01:37.310> apart

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
see so this is one of the changes apart

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
see so this is one of the changes apart
from<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.060> talk<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.619> animations

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
from this if we talk about animations

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
from this if we talk about animations
then<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> changes<00:01:42.540> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
then there are like bit of changes in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.340 
then there are like bit of changes in
the<00:01:42.780> animation<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.899> opening<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.049> app

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the animation as well so opening any app

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.639 
the animation as well so opening any app
is<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:48.180> different<00:01:48.390> earlier<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is now different earlier I mean the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.109 
is now different earlier I mean the
animation<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.579> seen<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.000> build<00:01:51.180> 10<00:01:51.540> 149

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
animation that was seen in build 10 149

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
animation that was seen in build 10 149
has<00:01:54.119> been<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:55.649> changed<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

at<00:02:21.650> least<00:02:21.830> long<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> 540<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:24.520> maybe<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.700> will<00:02:25.760> try

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
at least long a 540 so maybe we will try

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.080 
at least long a 540 so maybe we will try
it<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.630> lumia<00:02:26.840> 640<00:02:27.230> XL<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.680> will<00:02:27.860> report<00:02:28.090> but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
it on lumia 640 XL and will report but

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.090 
it on lumia 640 XL and will report but
now<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:29.660> now<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:29.990> missing<00:02:30.320> actually<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:34.070> you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
now for now it's missing actually so you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.210 
now for now it's missing actually so you
can<00:02:34.400> see<00:02:34.970> how<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.150> animation<00:02:35.660> works<00:02:35.840> here

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.490 

okay<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.900> talking<00:02:44.900> about<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> first

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
okay and talking about the first

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.870 
okay and talking about the first
impression<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> build<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.430> very<00:02:46.640> stable

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
impression the build is very stable

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640 
impression the build is very stable
while<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.390> can<00:02:47.600> face<00:02:47.870> some<00:02:48.140> issues<00:02:48.410> while

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
while you can face some issues while

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
while you can face some issues while
updating<00:02:48.860> which<00:02:49.520> we<00:02:49.700> have<00:02:49.820> already<00:02:49.940> reported

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
updating which we have already reported

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.780 
updating which we have already reported
in<00:02:50.750> our<00:02:50.870> installation<00:02:51.410> experience<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.730> you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
in our installation experience so you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.940 
in our installation experience so you
may<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.180> soft<00:02:53.630> reset<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.830> know<00:02:54.920> just

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
may have to soft reset and you know just

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.660 
may have to soft reset and you know just
to<00:02:55.810> install<00:02:56.810> twice<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:57.440> thrice<00:02:57.620> maybe<00:02:57.980> but

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
to install twice or thrice maybe but

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.510 
to install twice or thrice maybe but
once<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.300> gets<00:02:59.570> updated<00:03:00.050> all<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.130> things<00:03:01.310> work

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
once it gets updated all the things work

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.270 
once it gets updated all the things work
fine<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:02.120> mean<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> has<00:03:03.410> most<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.190> things

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
fine I mean it has most of the things

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.430 
fine I mean it has most of the things
were<00:03:04.460> working<00:03:04.640> fine<00:03:05.000> since<00:03:05.270> build<00:03:05.540> 10<00:03:05.900> 149

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
were working fine since build 10 149

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.500 
were working fine since build 10 149
over<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.920> build<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.220> quite<00:03:07.460> smooth<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:08.330> have

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
over the build is quite smooth we have

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.380 
over the build is quite smooth we have
not<00:03:08.750> faced<00:03:09.110> any<00:03:09.380> crashes<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.250> freeze<00:03:10.580> till<00:03:11.210> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
to build 10 166 so that there's a lot

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.080 
to build 10 166 so that there's a lot
about<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.140> build<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.220> still<00:03:19.490> obviously<00:03:19.910> as

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
about this build but still obviously as

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.240 
about this build but still obviously as
we<00:03:20.120> always<00:03:20.810> say<00:03:20.960> that<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:21.590> much<00:03:21.890> better<00:03:22.100> to

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
we always say that it's much better to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.580 
we always say that it's much better to
you<00:03:22.610> know<00:03:22.640> put<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.090> build<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:23.690> use<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.350> few

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you know put the build in use for few

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.800 
you know put the build in use for few
days<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.700> know<00:03:25.970> then<00:03:26.570> give<00:03:26.780> a
