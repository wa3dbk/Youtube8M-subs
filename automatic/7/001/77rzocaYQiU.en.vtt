00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
wing it's a it's a stealth aircraft its
unmanned<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.500> unlike<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
unmanned and it's unlike the other

unmanned and it's unlike the other
unmanned<00:01:06.689> aerial<00:01:07.049> vehicles<00:01:07.439> we've<00:01:07.590> seen<00:01:07.830> used

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
unmanned aerial vehicles we've seen used

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.539 
unmanned aerial vehicles we've seen used
elsewhere<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:10.049> predator<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.979> example<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
elsewhere the predator for example this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
elsewhere the predator for example this
is<00:01:11.610> jet<00:01:12.000> powered<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> fast

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is jet powered so this is this is fast

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
is jet powered so this is this is fast
it's<00:01:14.100> powered<00:01:14.400> by<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> general<00:01:14.970> electric<00:01:15.330> fan

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's powered by a general electric fan

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's powered by a general electric fan
jet<00:01:16.500> engine<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> others<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.580> turboprops<00:01:18.240> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
jet engine the others are turboprops can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
jet engine the others are turboprops can
move<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.580> targeted<00:01:21.330> country<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
move in and out of a targeted country at

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.120 
move in and out of a targeted country at
very<00:01:22.530> high<00:01:22.590> speeds<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> latest

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
very high speeds and so it's the latest

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
very high speeds and so it's the latest
technology<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.159> obviously<00:01:27.150> raised<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.630> few

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
technology and obviously raised a few

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
technology and obviously raised a few
eyebrows<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.070> spotted<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.579> Kandahar

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
eyebrows when it was spotted in Kandahar

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
eyebrows when it was spotted in Kandahar
that's<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.290> why<00:01:31.950> exactly<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that's right and you know why exactly is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
that's right and you know why exactly is
the<00:01:33.150> u.s.<00:01:33.540> operating<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.950> beast<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the u.s. operating this beast of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.789 
the u.s. operating this beast of
Kandahar<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.439> Afghanistan<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
Kandahar in Afghanistan if the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
Kandahar in Afghanistan if the
insurgents<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.400> no<00:01:38.549> radar<00:01:38.820> systems<00:01:39.420> there

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
insurgents have no radar systems there

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
insurgents have no radar systems there
obviously<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:41.000> Afghanistan<00:01:42.000> pretty

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
obviously we have Afghanistan pretty

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.499 
obviously we have Afghanistan pretty
well<00:01:42.479> covered<00:01:42.930> by<00:01:43.110> our<00:01:43.619> own<00:01:44.520> surveillance

and<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> understand<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:59.040> has

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and from what I understand there has

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.370 
and from what I understand there has
been<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.579> lot<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.790> testing<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.049> nellis

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
been a lot of testing going on at nellis

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
training what it would look like if they

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.580 
training what it would look like if they

were flying against a bunker a nuclear

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
bunker for example in Iran and I guess

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.440 
bunker for example in Iran and I guess
it's<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> stretch<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.640> think<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.120> maybe

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
it's not a stretch to think that maybe

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.360 
it's not a stretch to think that maybe
what's<00:02:24.170> happening<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:25.519> that<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
what's happening now is that the this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
what's happening now is that the this
what<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.790> called<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> desert<00:02:29.450> Prowler<00:02:29.780> it's

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
what it's called the desert Prowler it's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.589 
what it's called the desert Prowler it's
the<00:02:30.250> rq-170<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.459> was<00:02:31.580> spotted<00:02:31.940> at<00:02:32.060> Kandahar

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
the rq-170 that was spotted at Kandahar

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.380 
the rq-170 that was spotted at Kandahar
I<00:02:32.810> don't<00:02:33.560> think<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.890> stretch<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.390> consider

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I don't think it's a stretch to consider

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.880 
I don't think it's a stretch to consider
that<00:02:35.599> this<00:02:35.780> has<00:02:35.989> probably<00:02:36.230> been<00:02:36.440> flying

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
that this has probably been flying

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.610 
that this has probably been flying
against<00:02:37.310> targets<00:02:37.550> deep<00:02:38.030> inside<00:02:38.450> Iran<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.140> so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
against targets deep inside Iran and so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380 
against targets deep inside Iran and so
could<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.069> possibly<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.640> an<00:02:40.849> indication

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
could this possibly be an indication

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.729 
could this possibly be an indication
that<00:02:41.599> maybe<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.049> United<00:02:42.349> States<00:02:42.620> is

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
that maybe the United States is

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.920 
that maybe the United States is
preparing<00:02:43.190> for<00:02:43.310> something<00:02:43.640> bigger<00:02:44.360> with<00:02:44.629> Iran

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
preparing for something bigger with Iran

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.039 
preparing for something bigger with Iran
may<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.380> war<00:02:45.769> well<00:02:46.519> we<00:02:47.299> always<00:02:47.510> are

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
may be a war well we always are

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.900 
may be a war well we always are
collecting<00:02:48.560> intelligence<00:02:48.920> whether<00:02:49.489> there's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
collecting intelligence whether there's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.750 
collecting intelligence whether there's
a<00:02:50.000> war<00:02:50.299> appending<00:02:51.140> or<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:52.340> want<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.640> know

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
a war appending or not we want to know

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.569 
a war appending or not we want to know
what<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:52.970> capabilities<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.840> Iran<00:02:54.410> are<00:02:54.709> it's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
what the capabilities of Iran are it's

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.180 
what the capabilities of Iran are it's
also<00:02:55.870> i<00:02:56.870> don't<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.470> beyond<00:02:58.660> any<00:03:00.190> reasonable

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
also i don't think beyond any reasonable

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430 
also i don't think beyond any reasonable
doubt<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.420> could<00:03:02.630> be<00:03:02.720> flying<00:03:03.019> against

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
doubt that this could be flying against

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.550 
doubt that this could be flying against
pakistan<00:03:04.040> as<00:03:04.250> well<00:03:05.200> especially<00:03:06.200> the

kandahar but what we're seeing with the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.580 
kandahar but what we're seeing with the
use<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.069> this<00:03:13.370> unmanned<00:03:13.700> aerial<00:03:14.090> vehicle

use of this unmanned aerial vehicle
technology<00:03:15.590> against<00:03:16.040> iran<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.480> collect

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
technology against iran is to collect

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.080 
technology against iran is to collect
intelligence<00:03:18.170> right<00:03:19.040> now<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:19.639> with<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
intelligence right now what with the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
surveillance platform so there's

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.470

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
nuclear facilities and do you think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.039 
nuclear facilities and do you think
there<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.370> more<00:03:40.670> drones<00:03:41.150> out<00:03:41.450> there<00:03:41.780> like

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
there are more drones out there like

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.140 
there are more drones out there like
this<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.500> how<00:03:42.620> exactly<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:43.340> they<00:03:43.489> fit<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:43.970> with

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
this and how exactly do they fit in with

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.030 
this and how exactly do they fit in with
President<00:03:44.569> Obama's<00:03:44.989> new<00:03:45.170> strategy<00:03:45.859> in

expanded for use in the Gulf of Mexico
and<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.650> Caribbean<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:22.510> think<00:04:23.510> what<00:04:23.630> we're

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
and the Caribbean I think what we're

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.180 
and the Caribbean I think what we're
seeing<00:04:23.810> there<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
seeing there is the as the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.620 
seeing there is the as the
militarization<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.300> wall

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
militarization of wall

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.990 
militarization of wall
forcement<00:04:27.340> functions<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:28.820> that

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
forcement functions and I think that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.930 
forcement functions and I think that
that's<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.420> worrisome<00:04:29.900> aspect<00:04:30.940> domestically

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
that's a worrisome aspect domestically

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.910 
that's a worrisome aspect domestically
here<00:04:32.180> in<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> United<00:04:32.660> States<00:04:32.960> well<00:04:33.620> it's
