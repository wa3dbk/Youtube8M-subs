do it well you can't be an expert at

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
do it well you can't be an expert at
everything<00:01:12.119> surely<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.380> can't<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.010> expert

at<00:01:14.460> everything<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> same<00:01:15.210> time

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
at everything at the same time

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
at everything at the same time
definitely<00:01:15.960> nor<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.770> everything

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040

at the same time so I think there's a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
at the same time so I think there's a

I mean I don't read much of it myself I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
I mean I don't read much of it myself I
would<00:01:22.890> tend<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> read<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.390> say<00:01:24.570> Ben

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
host so rather than do that i sequenced

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.600 
host so rather than do that i sequenced
the<00:03:48.709> recipes<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.010> skills<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.580> that

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
the recipes and the skills so that

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.610 
the recipes and the skills so that
you're<00:03:50.790> starting<00:03:51.090> off<00:03:51.150> with<00:03:51.360> with<00:03:52.110> meals<00:03:52.500> that

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you're starting off with with meals that

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.770 
you're starting off with with meals that
have<00:03:52.770> zero<00:03:53.489> clean<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.120> take<00:03:54.330> five<00:03:54.540> minutes

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
have zero clean up and take five minutes

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.810 
have zero clean up and take five minutes
and<00:03:55.020> then<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.230> lead<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.770> where<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.489> doing

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
and then you lead up to where you doing

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.979 
and then you lead up to where you doing
all<00:03:56.940> those<00:03:57.120> things<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.959> your

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
all those things and then you have your

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.530 
all those things and then you have your
final<00:03:58.530> test<00:03:58.860> which<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.100> dinner<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
final test which is dinner for the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.600 
final test which is dinner for the
vorticity<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.560> basically<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.130> people<00:04:02.489> buy

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
vorticity so basically when people buy

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
vorticity so basically when people buy
cookbooks<00:04:02.970> hoping<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.840> they're<00:04:03.989> going<00:04:04.080> to

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
cookbooks hoping that they're going to

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.960 
cookbooks hoping that they're going to
go<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.380> make<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.680> these<00:04:04.769> recipes<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.820> also

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
didn't didn't exercise for the first two

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.770 
didn't didn't exercise for the first two
months<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:46.690> program<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:49.090> seems<00:04:49.360> America's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
months of the program it seems America's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.439 
months of the program it seems America's
given<00:04:50.050> for<00:04:50.229> self<00:04:50.410> of<00:04:50.560> books<00:04:51.220> much<00:04:51.699> more<00:04:52.000> than

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
given for self of books much more than

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.200 
given for self of books much more than
the<00:04:52.900> rest<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.259> wasn't<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:54.880> think

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
the rest of this wasn't I I think

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.850 
the rest of this wasn't I I think
there's<00:04:55.630> definitely<00:04:55.690> more<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.680> history

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
there's definitely more of the history

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.070 
there's definitely more of the history
of<00:04:57.280> help<00:04:58.030> from<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.240> US<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:59.169> the<00:05:00.509> suppose<00:05:01.509> it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of help from the US and the suppose it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.200 
of help from the US and the suppose it
would<00:05:02.349> come<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.860> being<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.699> very

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
would come to being a very

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.180 
would come to being a very
individualistic<00:05:04.810> society<00:05:05.229> another<00:05:05.919> one

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
individualistic society another one

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.240 
individualistic society another one
having<00:05:07.090> many<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.020> our<00:05:08.169> icons<00:05:08.680> or<00:05:08.889> founding

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
having many of our icons or founding

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.310 
having many of our icons or founding
fathers<00:05:09.610> also<00:05:09.849> perhaps<00:05:10.690> even<00:05:10.960> describe

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
fathers also perhaps even describe

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.350 
fathers also perhaps even describe
themselves<00:05:11.500> as<00:05:11.910> constantly<00:05:12.910> focused<00:05:13.270> on

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
themselves as constantly focused on

themselves as constantly focused on
self-improvement<00:05:13.750> Benjamin<00:05:14.259> Franklin

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
self-improvement Benjamin Franklin

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.589 
self-improvement Benjamin Franklin
Thomas<00:05:14.919> Jefferson<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:16.180> I<00:05:16.210> think<00:05:16.389> there's<00:05:16.539> a

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
Thomas Jefferson so I think there's a

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.140 
Thomas Jefferson so I think there's a
perhaps<00:05:17.139> tradition<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.099> that<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.120> think

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
perhaps tradition of that and I think

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.350 
perhaps tradition of that and I think
it's<00:05:19.419> also<00:05:19.539> new<00:05:19.810> cable<00:05:20.229> bill<00:05:20.680> by<00:05:20.830> other<00:05:20.979> names

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
it's also new cable bill by other names

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.589 
it's also new cable bill by other names
