00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.660 
up every spring and then letting them go
in<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.510> winter<00:03:30.500> I'll<00:03:30.950> cut<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.250> loose<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
in the winter I'll cut them loose and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.070 
in the winter I'll cut them loose and
then<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.880> springtime<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:32.660> time<00:03:32.900> up

would<00:04:03.170> be<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> good<00:04:03.440> project<00:04:03.650> for<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.100> what<00:04:04.820> I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
would be a good project for it what I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.120 
would be a good project for it what I
did<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.239> just<00:04:05.660> went<00:04:05.840> around<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.860> part

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
up here had branched out I went around

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.960 
up here had branched out I went around
it<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.799> pulled<00:04:10.190> them<00:04:10.280> together<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.880> then

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
together what I want I guess what I'm

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.580 
together what I want I guess what I'm
getting<00:04:16.519> at<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:16.880> want<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.600> grow<00:04:17.870> into

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
getting at is I want this to grow into

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.849 
getting at is I want this to grow into
one<00:04:18.799> solid<00:04:18.979> trunk<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:20.630> about<00:04:20.930> head<00:04:21.260> level<00:04:21.470> and
