00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello hello here and good today 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.790
 I bring a new review 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.260
 gameplay of a game called pixel 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.110
 with tweety and good as you can see is 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.500
 with aspects of minecraft because editing 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.779
 good minecraft in general but it's in 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.680
 first person and how can you see here 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.239
 the controls come out as it moves 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.730
 as it says how we move as 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.579
 we shoot how we change weapons and this 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.880
 start and good is very simple or a is 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.390
 line we shot 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.610
 we shot him is already good with that 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.190
 we shoot with this recharge and with 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.260
 this we jump and well the game is very 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.240
 father set as I tell you in what 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.290
 it's minecraft 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.600
 the great thing is the way in which more 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.560
 love is like by the way in which 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.610
 reload 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.410
 how to fold it or many many caracas 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.310
 many place 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.229
 as I say the way he does his 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.720
 recharges as it reloads the weapon I do not know 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.670
 like I think that not only is it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.550
 since while we are moving forward 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.430
 game length 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.190
 we are taking more and as you can see there 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.640
 many monsters like this zombie that 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.060
 it seems that he breaks his legs for being 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.460
 such a good dancer was 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.210
 a curse that put a mind 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.770
 die to nothing be inventing things 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.640
 but good the truth the game with my 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 father at the beginning as if it is medium 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.460
 boring to have to recharge because no 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.090
 There is a lot of variety but good and here 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 I took a gun 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.520
 or super submachine gun today in this new 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.640
 It's never very good but we're not going 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.799
 to spend it since I've never passed 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 To tell the truth, I have never passed the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.350
 first level because I say of the first 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.440
 level of the second because you get 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.240
 very rough and difficult is difficult 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.440
 more than anything like a little bit 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.500
 controls I do not just get used to 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.150
 and in itself that would be what we are going to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.720
 try to go to the next level 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.850
 so that they see more or less how it changes 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.640
 they are different scenarios although 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.020
 we just say it enters the portal and it's that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.920
 little part of there will be that we have more 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.050
 bullets loaded and goes to the portal 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.209
 and as I say the game is very, very 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.440
 father is in the first person obviously 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.670
 survive all possible waves and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 as I tell you the nine steps of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.310
 second level I do not know if there are many more 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.380
 I also will not lie to them and good 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.959
 how can 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.390
 gigi or come out of nowhere that's like a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.200
 species of flu but 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.360
 set in 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.610
 what are the pyramids and other the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.990
 ancient egypt and good now we 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.110
 chases a mummy like that and nothing else 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.670
 we shoot him and good and if they ask 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.310
 hey but where did you get the game or 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.160
 something like that would give them the link of 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.730
 download but I do not have the apk itself 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 because where did I get it from, believe me 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.780
 a little hard to be playing and 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.240
 commenting and more on this type of games 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.819
 and I took it out of apt I 'll go if anyone knows 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.370
 how to be fit and then look in the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.980
 game and there it is updated and everything is 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.330
 great and if not then some page of 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.880
 internet that you with the fields of 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.250
 that they have raised it and they are going to kill me 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.830
 and they 're going to kill me so we run like 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.860
 cowards since we shoot more 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.800
 we shoot we shoot like crazy and I 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.970
 takes everyone takes me all what good 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:03.650
 and I locked myself to that bird 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.650
 kill well and I'm no yes no yes 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.170
 not if I have ok so I'm walking from 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.030
 That's how I am, I have two hearts 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.030
 two hearts 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.190
 we run we run and nothing and if 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.890
 this game as I tell you is amazing 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.520
 in the past of this second level 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.100
 because it is half complicated when 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.970
 quite complicated for me obviously 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.300
 because if I'm good at first-rate games 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.530
 person of his despair 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.810
 I do not know I do not know I've already lost practice and nothing 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.780
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.370
 review and gameplay of this game that is 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.310
 incredible the truth if they like the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.470
 first person games and minecraft 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.319
 so I invite you to download it 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.319
 because it is to combine its two best 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.840
 game styles that you like most in 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.490
 one alone and it's amazing and I'm going to 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.430
 I will die I will die I will 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.460
 die and nothing without subscribe if they are or not 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.390
 they have done it like they commented and I already 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.000
 They killed 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.180
 and see you in the next video up 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.180
 then
