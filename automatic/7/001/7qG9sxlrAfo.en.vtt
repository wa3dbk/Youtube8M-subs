00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.080
 today we continue and work together with the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.090
 our hat we positioned the 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.599
 four brand points and now we are ready 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.460
 to deal with the decreases what they are 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.099
 the decreases once we have 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.110
 made the part on our hat 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.369
 of the ribbed edge by working two straight and 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.849
 two showers 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.989
 then the part of the body in stockinette stitch 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.230
 we can observe here on the hat 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.210
 these lines that are ours 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.000
 decreases and are made close each 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.629
 brand point treat our brand points 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.649
 we will serve as a reference point 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.050
 at the beginning we will create a line a 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.989
 little more harmonious little alternating a 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.059
 decrease turn with a straight turn and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.140
 then we continue with the decreases each 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.010
 around when we are here we have finished e 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.440
 we continue our brand point 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.320
 at the beginning of the tour we move it and if we start 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.420
 our round of decreases ours 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.540
 instructions will always tell us to work 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.480
 up to straight up to two meshes first 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.690
 of the brand point then knitting 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.940
 shaved making rights when 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.250
 I see my brand name starts at 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 slow down the shirts there are 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.540
 three I have to get up to 2 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 so there is still one in the work 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.990
 two work together with obverse 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.650
 then he takes them together and works at 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.400
 straight and then exposed the brand point so 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.470
 carried out my first decrease 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.030
 continuing I have to do it for each of my own 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.590
 marta dot then I work all the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 links up to two meshes before 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.900
 of the brand I point here or four lines 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.970
 that I'm creating the first few decreases 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.990
 three are given by these brand points 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.280
 greens here you see that I have 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.800
 made the two shirts straight together 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.840
 and I will make the fourth before the brand 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.659
 starting point because these is 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 always a line of decreases us 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.159
 let's see one more set 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.200
 so I always work straight because 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.620
 this hat is made of knit 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 shaved and is perfect for learning to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.239
 make the first hats because not 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.090
 we are focused on points 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.739
 details and when we get to ours 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.890
 brand point we do it slowly 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.489
 together I told her my two shirts le 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.030
 I work together and made mine 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.709
 first decrease to create a line 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.930
 a little bit more harmonious 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.799
 in the first six rounds we alternate one 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.470
 round of decreases with a round to straight 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.579
 so we will have three rounds of decreases 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.280
 when we did this 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.069
 we continue making decreases to each 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.519
 around and we do so until 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.250
 we will have 20 meshes on our iron in 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.569
 so as to be able to then close in the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.760
 next phase 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.459
 our cap definitively 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.940
 and hide the pigtails in the meantime 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.640
 we continue and work together all the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.359
 decreases and we practice on 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.700
 stockinette stitch and on decreases 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:33.109
 here we come before my here 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.099
 my brand is still working on two 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.590
 together and then shaken point brand 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.220
 beg of round and now effect the highlight around 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.620
 in stockinette he continues and work 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.590
 meanwhile I also practice on the shirt 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.389
 shaved good job and see you at 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.140
 next time to close the 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.200
 bonnet 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.200
 Well
