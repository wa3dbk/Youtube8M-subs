defense right through into the attack it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
defense right through into the attack it
was<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.960> great<00:00:22.500> team<00:00:22.740> performance<00:00:23.189> really

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369

was just a great team performance really
yeah<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> thought<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.539> defended<00:00:24.930> very

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
yeah was the thought we defended very

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.929 
yeah was the thought we defended very
well<00:00:25.289> pressed<00:00:26.039> him<00:00:26.189> into<00:00:26.400> making<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
well pressed him into making a lot of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
well pressed him into making a lot of
long<00:00:27.090> passes<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:27.779> maybe<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> wants<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
long passes when maybe that it wants a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.650 
long passes when maybe that it wants a
that<00:00:29.609> starts<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> front<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that starts from the front and then the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600 
that starts from the front and then the
boys<00:00:30.840> defended<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.500> well<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> back<00:00:31.920> bit

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
boys defended really well the back bit

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.190 
boys defended really well the back bit
just<00:00:32.759> wanting<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> concede<00:00:33.510> from<00:00:33.690> sat<00:00:33.960> play

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
just wanting to concede from sat play

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
just wanting to concede from sat play
but<00:00:34.440> other<00:00:35.190> than<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> thought

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
but other than that you know I thought

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.490 
but other than that you know I thought
we<00:00:36.210> deserved<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> win<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.230> should

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
we deserved the win we probably should

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.670 
we deserved the win we probably should
have<00:00:38.120> squad<00:00:39.120> mop<00:00:39.329> squad<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.260> half<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
couple of times so that was

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080

say maybe the titles of the aisle are

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
say maybe the titles of the aisle are
each<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.720> changes<00:01:10.049> nothing<00:01:10.200> towards

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
each now that changes nothing towards

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
each now that changes nothing towards
whether<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.189> isn't<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:12.090> still

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
whether it is or isn't it's still

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
whether it is or isn't it's still
mathematically<00:01:12.840> possible<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> say
