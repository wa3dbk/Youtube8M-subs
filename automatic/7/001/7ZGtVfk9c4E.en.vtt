 event point 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:27.140

 today we are here at the fair of 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.630
 motrileños 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 the reporter more 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.000
 and I 'm going to get closer to the villagers 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 put it a little bit of rich 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.620
 if you do not smell a lot of party wine 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 good good I'm going through why 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.160
 this year also of parties of all 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.160
 days 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.620
 not here 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.690
 How is the good service going? 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.920
 we are having a quiet service 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.930
 compared to the one that was yesterday that the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.480
 influx of people was much greater and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.880
 there was more at risk of danger 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.530
 believes that they have put the fair this year 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.640
 here so that the police do not have to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.590
 move the culillo of the food a lot 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 or because they have not amortized enough the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.300
 giant screen with the global this 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.300
 year 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.690
 A lot asks you to be close to me 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.430
 expert in this subject I like more in the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.270
 streets here another one fucking shit 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.220
 honestly because because before I was 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.280
 the most people left and all the roll and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 now also chicken tucked 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.729
 if for me for example it suits me 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 we won clear for you it was more 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.900
 easy not work if done only here 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 what qualities do you have to have a good 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.530
 from Madrid 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.909
 it was a privilege 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.200
 maybe you can download it 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.050
 swear here is the party to the beach 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.810
 there are two men I will not criticize my 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.120
 town 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.280
 I would not know how to tell you because I am a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 mix half argentine half madrileño 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.430
 but it takes a sweet taste like cane 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.270
 sugar 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.210
 I thought it was the first motril fair 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.130
 in 1905 at a fair from which you can 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.220
 let do what you want you could 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.410
 go out to ask something to take your drinks 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 If I did not have money and there was no problem 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.700
 nobody was looking at you with a bad face 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.480
 how would it be for you 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.750
 the ideal life fair that I would have to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.270
 to have 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.200
 at the doors cheap girl short 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.200
 yes police 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.510
 a kilometer of tent that has everything 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.370
 sprinkler shades and free drink yo 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.190
 for me to look at ideal the rest of 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.630
 the years if today's music is true 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.630
 too sevillian for my taste 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.769
 which do you think is the most 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.340
 emblematic of the fair 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.120
 only part 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.840

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.850
 Sub-Saharans who are trying 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 jump the fence of melilla to catch 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.810
 a ferry and come here to the fair of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.010
 motril 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.010
 do not dress in love 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.660
 because of partying 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.620
 all fences that break the payment I 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.360
 as a civil protection volunteer I know that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.850
 we do not have the means to receive them and 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.770
 treat them all 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.020
 I have no words to throw eggs 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.360

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.600

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.600
 day 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.809
 yes 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.360
 taking into account the social conjuncture 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:37.319
 where home is throwing with this is a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.319
 little risky 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.520

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.520
