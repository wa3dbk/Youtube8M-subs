I'm going to start building the walking
platform<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.320> 41<00:00:34.860> feet<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:36.150> here<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.780> over

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
platform it's 41 feet from here to over

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.130 
platform it's 41 feet from here to over
there<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.880> doing<00:00:39.030> we've<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:39.960> these

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
there so we're doing we've got these

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.620 
there so we're doing we've got these
cables<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.130> runners<00:00:41.480> make<00:00:42.480> these

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
cables we got these runners make these

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.400 
cables we got these runners make these
little<00:00:43.400> copper<00:00:44.600> clips<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.840> were<00:00:45.960> putting<00:00:46.230> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
little copper clips that were putting on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
little copper clips that were putting on
to<00:00:47.130> attach<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.730> runner<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:49.650> the<00:00:49.680> cable<00:00:50.400> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to attach the runner to the cable is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
to attach the runner to the cable is
this<00:00:51.390> enough<00:00:51.780> flexibility<00:00:52.520> to<00:00:53.520> slide<00:00:53.850> them

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this enough flexibility to slide them

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
this enough flexibility to slide them
down<00:00:54.739> now<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.130> just<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.460> be

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
down now these are just going to be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.460 
down now these are just going to be
running<00:00:56.640> replaced<00:00:57.300> every<00:00:57.570> two<00:00:57.810> feet<00:00:58.170> now

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
running replaced every two feet now

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.620 
running replaced every two feet now
we're<00:00:59.220> walking<00:00:59.460> planks<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.210> could<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
we're walking planks we could do the

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.300 
we're walking planks we could do the
whole<00:01:00.750> bridge<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
whole bridge like this

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.319 
whole bridge like this
it'd<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> heck<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.630> a<00:01:03.810> lot<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> weight<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:05.329> heck

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
it'd be a heck of a lot of weight a heck

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.060 
it'd be a heck of a lot of weight a heck
of<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.509> lot<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.780> money<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.800> wouldn't<00:01:07.979> be

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
of a lot of money and it wouldn't be

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 
of a lot of money and it wouldn't be
nearly<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.430> scary<00:01:09.380> okay<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.440> we've<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
nearly as scary okay so we've got the
