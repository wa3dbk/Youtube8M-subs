00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.410 
it off this is the mac 217 so the famous
fluffy<00:01:54.170> dome<00:01:54.380> brush<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.069> it<00:01:55.759> looks<00:01:55.940> like<00:01:56.030> this

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
fluffy dome brush and it looks like this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.960 
fluffy dome brush and it looks like this
now<00:01:56.720> i<00:01:57.560> find<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.220> little<00:01:58.490> bit<00:01:58.670> flexible

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
now i find it is a little bit flexible

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.160 
now i find it is a little bit flexible
and<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.920> if<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.250> don't<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:01.750> soft<00:02:02.750> brushes

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and so if you don't like soft brushes

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.900 
and so if you don't like soft brushes
you<00:02:03.560> might<00:02:03.770> want<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.100> go<00:02:04.190> for<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.429> stiffer<00:02:04.759> brush

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
you might want to go for a stiffer brush

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.690 
you might want to go for a stiffer brush
when<00:02:05.750> i<00:02:05.780> first<00:02:06.050> bought<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.470> one<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.979> didn't

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
when i first bought this one I didn't

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.010 
when i first bought this one I didn't
really<00:02:07.850> know<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.330> hype<00:02:08.479> was<00:02:08.509> all<00:02:08.780> about

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
really know what the hype was all about

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.749 
really know what the hype was all about
and<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.350> didn't<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.190> as<00:02:10.520> much<00:02:10.550> as

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and I didn't like it as much as

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.290 
and I didn't like it as much as
everybody<00:02:11.650> has<00:02:12.650> said<00:02:12.920> but<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.940> because<00:02:14.090> I

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
everybody has said but that's because I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.340 
everybody has said but that's because I
didn't<00:02:14.510> really<00:02:14.630> know<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> use<00:02:15.170> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
didn't really know how to use it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.920 
didn't really know how to use it
properly<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:16.250> also<00:02:16.730> was<00:02:17.209> too<00:02:17.510> big<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:17.900> my

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
properly it also was too big for my

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
properly it also was too big for my
crease<00:02:18.290> area<00:02:18.470> because<00:02:18.980> my<00:02:19.100> crease<00:02:19.370> area<00:02:19.580> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
crease area because my crease area is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.510 
crease area because my crease area is
quite<00:02:20.060> small<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.860> started<00:02:21.920> using<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
quite small but as I started using it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.699 
quite small but as I started using it
more<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.819> more<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.330> found<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.500> really

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
more and more I found that it's really

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.190 
more and more I found that it's really
good<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.310> applying<00:02:26.090> eyeshadow<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.750> blending

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
good for applying eyeshadow and blending

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.410 
good for applying eyeshadow and blending
colors<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:28.370> necessarily<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.180> crease

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
colors and not necessarily in the crease

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.140 
colors and not necessarily in the crease
area<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:30.170> for<00:02:30.440> other<00:02:30.590> purposes<00:02:30.830> as<00:02:31.280> well<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.880> I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
area but for other purposes as well so I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.570 
area but for other purposes as well so I
use<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.900> everyday<00:02:33.260> for<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.860> purpose<00:02:34.310> or

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
use this everyday for one purpose or

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
use this everyday for one purpose or
another<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.630> think<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.020> really<00:02:36.200> great

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
another and I think it's a really great

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160 
another and I think it's a really great
brush<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.580> fourth<00:02:37.970> Mac<00:02:38.360> brush<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.959> have

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
brush the fourth Mac brush that I have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.220 
brush the fourth Mac brush that I have
here<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.950> 239<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> fluffy

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
here is the 239 and this is a fluffy

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.260 
here is the 239 and this is a fluffy
eyeshadow<00:02:42.380> brush<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.849> one<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
eyeshadow brush it's not one of the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940 
eyeshadow brush it's not one of the
stiff<00:02:44.540> flat<00:02:44.870> ones<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.410> actually<00:02:45.769> quite

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
stiff flat ones it's actually quite

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.569 
stiff flat ones it's actually quite
fluffy<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:48.379> reason<00:02:48.650> why<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.769> like<00:02:49.069> this<00:02:49.310> is

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
fluffy the reason why I like this is

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.570 
fluffy the reason why I like this is
because<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.989> pick<00:02:51.140> up<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.349> lot

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
because you can pick up a lot

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.130 
because you can pick up a lot
I<00:02:51.610> shadow<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.300> opposed<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.750> some<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.020> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I shadow as opposed to some of the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.770 
I shadow as opposed to some of the
flatter<00:02:53.410> brushes<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.150> still<00:02:55.480> quite

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
flatter brushes and it is still quite

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.500 
flatter brushes and it is still quite
stiff<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.460> can<00:02:57.610> pack<00:02:57.820> on<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.030> eyeshadow

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
stiff so you can pack on the eyeshadow

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.660 
stiff so you can pack on the eyeshadow
really<00:02:58.930> quickly<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.860> example<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.250> all<00:03:00.400> over

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
really quickly for example in all over

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.610 
really quickly for example in all over
lid<00:03:00.820> color<00:03:01.120> or<00:03:01.540> whatnot<00:03:01.780> if<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.260> wanted<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
will do the job the last Mac brush that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.960 
will do the job the last Mac brush that
I<00:03:06.610> have<00:03:06.850> here<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:08.190> 219<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.370> believe<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.940> is

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
I have here is the 219 I believe it is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.920 
I have here is the 219 I believe it is
the<00:03:10.510> 219<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.310> pencil<00:03:12.940> brush<00:03:13.090> so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the 219 and it's the pencil brush so

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.750 
the 219 and it's the pencil brush so
this<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.380> your<00:03:14.470> basic<00:03:14.680> pencil<00:03:15.250> brush<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
this is just your basic pencil brush I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.090 
this is just your basic pencil brush I
mean<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.300> like<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.290> because<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.770> pencil

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
mean I like it because it's a pencil

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.200 
mean I like it because it's a pencil
brush<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.400> don't<00:03:18.580> really<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.820> another

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
brush and I don't really have another

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.910 
brush and I don't really have another
pencil<00:03:19.510> brush<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.650> something

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
pencil brush if you have something

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.680 
pencil brush if you have something
similar<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.700> isn't<00:03:22.150> Mac<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.540> could

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
similar to this that isn't Mac you could

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.350 
similar to this that isn't Mac you could
do<00:03:22.810> with<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:22.990> as<00:03:23.230> well<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.680> use<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.550> every<00:03:24.700> day

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
do with that as well I use it every day

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.530 
do with that as well I use it every day
basically<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.410> either<00:03:26.530> set<00:03:27.040> my<00:03:27.250> liner<00:03:27.520> or<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
basically to either set my liner or to

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.449 
basically to either set my liner or to
smoke<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.930> out<00:03:28.990> on<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> top<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.770> bottom<00:03:30.100> lash

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
smoke it out on the top and bottom lash

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.430 
smoke it out on the top and bottom lash
line<00:03:30.490> so<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.360> just<00:03:31.600> pick<00:03:31.720> up<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.200> bit<00:03:32.320> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
line so I just pick up a little bit of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.699 
line so I just pick up a little bit of
dark<00:03:32.740> eye<00:03:33.160> shadow<00:03:33.880> or<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:35.140> colored<00:03:35.530> eyeshadow

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
brushes the first one I have here is by

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.100 
brushes the first one I have here is by
Sephora<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.090> foundation<00:03:57.600> brush<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
Sephora and it's a foundation brush and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.110 
Sephora and it's a foundation brush and
if<00:03:58.650> you'd<00:03:58.860> just<00:03:59.070> your<00:03:59.250> basic<00:03:59.400> foundation

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
if you'd just your basic foundation

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.660 
if you'd just your basic foundation
brush<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.540> came<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.290> brush<00:04:01.560> kit<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.370> reason

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
brush it came in a brush kit the reason

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.160 
brush it came in a brush kit the reason
why<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:03.930> fairly

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
why I like this is because it's fairly

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.790 
why I like this is because it's fairly
thick<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.830> it's<00:04:05.780> stiff<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.260> have<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> lot

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
thick and it's stiff so you have a lot

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.680 
thick and it's stiff so you have a lot
of<00:04:07.830> control<00:04:08.280> over<00:04:08.340> where<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.970> apply<00:04:09.270> it<00:04:09.300> on

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
of control over where you apply it on

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.860 
of control over where you apply it on
your<00:04:09.720> face<00:04:10.520> whereas<00:04:11.520> some<00:04:12.120> other<00:04:12.300> foundation

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
your face whereas some other foundation

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.420 
your face whereas some other foundation
brushes<00:04:13.110> I've<00:04:13.380> tried<00:04:13.590> such<00:04:13.800> as<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.010> elf<00:04:14.160> one

brushes I've tried such as the elf one

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.610 
brushes I've tried such as the elf one
is<00:04:14.550> really<00:04:14.790> thin<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.210> flimsy<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.960> that's<00:04:16.470> why

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
is really thin and flimsy so that's why

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.310 
is really thin and flimsy so that's why
I<00:04:16.650> really<00:04:16.920> like<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.280> one<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.850> definitely

see and also the bristles are quite
stiff<00:04:40.410> now<00:04:41.160> if<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.370> compare<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.060> 217<00:04:42.720> from
