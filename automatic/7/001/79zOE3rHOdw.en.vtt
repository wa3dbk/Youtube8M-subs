00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:41.890
There's a flower
In the smallest garden

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.760
Reaching for the light
There's a candle

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.210
In the darkest corner
Conquering the night

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.070
There is amazing strength
And a willing hand

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:12.560
There are victories
That you've never planned

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.590
There's a hero
In everybody's heart

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
There's a fire
Inside of everybody

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.810
Burning clear and bright
There's a power

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.460
In the faintest heartbeat
That cannot be denied

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.119
Go on and trust yourself
You can ride the wind

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.119
Your gonna take your dreams
Where they've never been

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.429
There's a hero
In everybody's heart

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:06.200
Go on and trust yourself
You can ride the wind

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:52.640
Your gonna take your dreams
Where they've never been

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.920
There's a hero
In everybody's heart

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.390
There's a hero
In everybody's heart
