hello world at Sandra Masada again and
today<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.720> April<00:00:07.410> 5th<00:00:07.799> 2012<00:00:08.929> we're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
today is April 5th 2012 we're going to

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.980 
today is April 5th 2012 we're going to
do<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.559> second<00:00:11.010> test<00:00:11.190> print<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.000> cube

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
do the second test print for the cube

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.060 
do the second test print for the cube
dual<00:00:13.769> extrusion<00:00:14.309> red<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> yellow<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:17.039> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
dual extrusion red and yellow in here I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.090 
dual extrusion red and yellow in here I
have<00:00:17.430> black<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.090> white<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> last<00:00:19.590> time<00:00:19.859> we

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
have black and white and last time we

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.150 
have black and white and last time we
failed<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.510> cube<00:00:21.930> beginning<00:00:22.830> came

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
failed because the cube beginning came

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.670 
failed because the cube beginning came
off<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.670> build<00:00:23.880> platform<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:25.170> time<00:00:25.230> we'll

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
off the build platform this time we'll

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
off the build platform this time we'll
be<00:00:25.800> raising<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.369> temperature<00:00:26.730> 10<00:00:27.449> degrees

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
be raising the temperature 10 degrees

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.650 
be raising the temperature 10 degrees
Celsius<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> hundred<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> hundred<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
Celsius from a hundred to a hundred and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.959 
Celsius from a hundred to a hundred and
ten<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.260> I'll<00:00:31.380> show<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ten and I'll show you how to do that so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.060 
ten and I'll show you how to do that so
that<00:00:33.180> your<00:00:33.570> print<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.469> print<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that your print and my print can

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450 
that your print and my print can
actually<00:00:35.430> work<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.620> machine<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.340> has

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
actually work with this machine it has

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
actually work with this machine it has
the<00:00:39.000> program<00:00:39.360> through<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> SD<00:00:40.800> card<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.280> the

go to file open in replicator jeep and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.090 
go to file open in replicator jeep and
since<00:01:32.969> I'm<00:01:33.210> doing<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.780> calibration<00:01:34.770> duel

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
since I'm doing the calibration duel

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
since I'm doing the calibration duel
g-code<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.569> I<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.780> dual<00:01:36.959> extruders

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
g-code because I have dual extruders

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.690 
g-code because I have dual extruders
I'll<00:01:37.770> select<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.399> one<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.340> file

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
I'll select that one in this file

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.639 
I'll select that one in this file
there's<00:01:42.270> lots<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> information<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.469> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
there's lots of information about the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.760 
there's lots of information about the
accesses<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.390> temperatures<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
accesses and the temperatures here is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.719 
accesses and the temperatures here is
the<00:01:47.459> build<00:01:47.700> platform<00:01:48.209> temperature<00:01:49.549> here<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the build platform temperature here is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.249 
the build platform temperature here is
both<00:01:51.539> extruders<00:01:52.229> set<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.679> 220<00:01:53.569> Celsius<00:01:54.569> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
both extruders set the 220 Celsius and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
both extruders set the 220 Celsius and
then<00:01:55.739> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.009> go<00:01:56.220> down<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.819> to<00:01:56.939> notice

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
then if you go down you get to notice

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
then if you go down you get to notice
how<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.539> x<00:01:58.310> y<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.759> z<00:02:01.700> information<00:02:02.700> goes<00:02:02.909> into

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
how the x y and z information goes into

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
how the x y and z information goes into
the<00:02:03.679> MakerBot<00:02:04.679> system<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.840> platform<00:02:07.259> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the MakerBot system this platform this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.199 
the MakerBot system this platform this
program<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.819> probably<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> run<00:02:09.690> 20<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
program is probably going to run 20 to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.350 
program is probably going to run 20 to
25<00:02:12.209> minutes<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.910> we'll<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.329> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
25 minutes with all this so we'll go to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
25 minutes with all this so we'll go to
what<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:15.989> need<00:02:16.230> we're<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> go<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.799> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
what we need we're going to go to the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.500 
what we need we're going to go to the
platform<00:02:17.220> temperature<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.269> we're<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
platform temperature and we're going to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
platform temperature and we're going to
change<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.930> from<00:02:19.110> 100<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.900> 110<00:02:22.549> what<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.579> do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
change that from 100 to 110 what I do

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.080 
change that from 100 to 110 what I do
next<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.329> hit<00:02:24.480> save<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.340> wait<00:02:26.609> until

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
next is I hit save and then I wait until

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
next is I hit save and then I wait until
it<00:02:27.239> saves<00:02:27.569> completely<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.889> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it saves completely because there is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.780 
it saves completely because there is
little<00:02:29.310> bug

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
little bug

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.479 
little bug
if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.060> hit<00:02:30.269> build<00:02:30.829> while<00:02:31.829> it's<00:02:32.130> trying<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
if you hit build while it's trying to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.490 
if you hit build while it's trying to
save<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.680> there's<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> bug<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.470> back

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
save and there's the bug so I go back

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.949 
save and there's the bug so I go back
into<00:02:37.680> replicator<00:02:38.400> G<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> build<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
into replicator G and then I build it

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.199 
into replicator G and then I build it
again<00:02:40.290> I'll<00:02:41.100> eventually<00:02:41.430> find<00:02:41.639> out<00:02:42.060> this

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
again I'll eventually find out this

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.250 
again I'll eventually find out this
error<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.079> I'm<00:02:43.410> gonna<00:02:43.530> save<00:02:44.220> over<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.910> had

let<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.410> build<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.950> we're<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:50.220> set<00:02:50.459> to
