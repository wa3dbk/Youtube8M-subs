00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.429
 I don't even have enough 3 keys to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.799
 take another gadget that we have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.139
 Today our editorial staff is short 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 suddenly we had three in our office 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.119
 acer liquid devices 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.000
 it's a little z2 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 e1 and absolutely new e2 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.719
 let's start with the smallest device under 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.620
 the name z2 is the easiest diagonal 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.690
 three and a half inches resolution 320 on 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.140
 480 points 512 megabytes of operational 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.140
 of memory 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 single - core processor with a clock 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 frequency of 1 gigahertz running under 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 running android 4 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.500
 Now I will say how much about the phone 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.710
 please 4141 this is not bad 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.930
 but of course on such a gland and such 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.530
 resolution 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 Here is the feeling of working with the gadget at all 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.130
 thread but then it costs all 5000 and in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.850
 principle for the money to buy it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.009
 how are they to drive nephew to school 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 but these two models are of course 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 more serious was first announced 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 model e1 and outwardly she even told me 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.549
 like a little more please with 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.900
 level 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.780
 maybe because it is black though 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.119
 type white color is now in fashion and all 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.920
 but for some reason I like it 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.079
 like for example u 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.310
 her one here is the texture on the back 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.189
 lid and nice such 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.149
 gritty slightly plastic fine 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 two speakers system dts 8 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.060
 no 5 megapixel camera lying this 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.740
 by the way one of the few differences e2 and you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.790
 one cooler camera but more on that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.570
 later so here is a dual core processor with 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.090
 clock speed of 1.3 gigahertz 1 gig 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.149
 random access memory 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 screen diagonal 4 inch resolution 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.500
 960 by 540 points natural display ps 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.099
 why is natural because u and cheese in 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.989
 old models 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:24.560
 basically like that in the older sorry 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:29.930
 running android 4 1 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.439
 also please by the way what is interesting here 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 here for some reason does not quite fit 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.519
 button to call the settings menu but it 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.069
 obviously because of the Russification the fact that here 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.319
 all somehow very much without cuts 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.970
 one side is cool when not 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.579
 wacky operating system cuts 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.290
 on the other hand, well, not everything fits 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:56.620
 I drove as usual here test quadrant 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.290
 now I will show you the results 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.200
 please discharge such 3053 points this 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.180
 again as with tablet 1 and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.480
 whom we also told between 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.030
 asus transformer prime and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.790
 motorola atrix 4g 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.510
 normal result is quite for such 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.609
 iron working under this screen in 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.349
 Basically, the system is not particularly 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.980
 it slows down without any unnecessary 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.500
 add-ons only have whale type widgets 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.109
 weather specifically and all that here 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.569
 this thing costs 9000 rubles for 9 thousand 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:40.459
 rubles in my opinion is quite a good machine 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.799
 nice jit in hand lightweight most powerful 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.799
 the apparatus of today's our troika is 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.690
 and sire liquid e2 screen diagonal here 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.780
 same 4 inch soldered and resolution 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.000
 same 960 on 540 &amp; technology matrix 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.709
 also such a ps and that is cool 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.389
 the picture is not bad viewing angles are not very 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.480
 big power consumption in that sense 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.750
 that the resolution is not super 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.830
 awesome why is it needed there type 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 full hd 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.200
 I do not really understand but here already 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.230
 installed quad-core processor with 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.709
 clock speed of 1.3 gigahertz 1 gig 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.080
 RAM 4 gigabytes of memory 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.040
 the main way as in barely as in e1 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.190
 which can be expanded with 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.880
 micro sd cards up to 32 gigabytes 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.740
 and it works all under control already 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.110
 android 4.2 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.800
 as for the performance of this 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.510
 model it is certainly higher than that of e1 on 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.190
 eight hundred and sixty five points on 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.750
 versions 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.240
 synthetic performance tests 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.210
 quadrant standart 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.590
 although the gap is exactly the same between 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.199
 asus transformer prime 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.169
 this model is located and motorola atrix 4g 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.260
 so here is quite interesting well and if 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.660
 don't go into i would say not very 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.010
 big differences in design as well as already 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.010
 showed they look like feels talk then 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.139
 another important difference and 2 and 1 is more 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.090
 8 megapixel cool camera 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 difference from and one which 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.849
 5 megapixels is also a good machine on 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.320
 my mind quad processor everything 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.280
 quite powerful so nice 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.160
 universal design white color 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.550
 trend and all 11 pieces well rubles 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.450
 not bad in my not bad essere does 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.610
 Recently, many different models 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.920
 began to go more mobile models 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.430
 phones and all of them 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.100
 not super top but enough 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.770
 budget and at the same time for its price is very 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:54.250
 not bad if you are looking for something not great 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.100
 brand and you do not really want to spend 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.870
 a lot of money for extra performance 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.850
 that you will not use the excess 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.170
 the functionality is quite a secret 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.170
 a good option I advise you to look
