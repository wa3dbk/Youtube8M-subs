00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
here and now let's go a little bit under
software<00:01:32.880> where<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
software where you can see that is of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
software where you can see that is of
course<00:01:34.380> quite<00:01:34.979> fast<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> comes<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
course quite fast when it comes to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.370 
course quite fast when it comes to
loading<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.720> they're<00:01:36.869> three<00:01:37.079> gigs<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
loading because they're three gigs of

loading because they're three gigs of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.039 
and because there is no SD card slot
available<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.880> again<00:02:05.149> here<00:02:05.329> just<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.689> few<00:02:05.719> apps

with<00:02:07.850> some<00:02:08.030> sanity<00:02:08.450> don't<00:02:09.049> overload<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
with some sanity don't overload the

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.130 
with some sanity don't overload the
phones<00:02:09.950> let's<00:02:10.280> tell<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.000> camera<00:02:11.239> can<00:02:11.840> see<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
phones let's tell the camera can see the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.449 
phones let's tell the camera can see the
back<00:02:12.290> camera<00:02:12.500> which<00:02:12.739> is<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.950> course<00:02:12.980> quite

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
back camera which is of course quite

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.280 
back camera which is of course quite
quick

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
quick

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.340 
quick
also<00:02:16.290> why<00:02:16.440> Daniel

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.960 

also<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.160> low-light<00:02:20.430> pictures<00:02:20.850> probably

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
also for low-light pictures probably

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490 
also for low-light pictures probably
quite<00:02:21.330> nice<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.690> we'll<00:02:21.870> try<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:22.260> later

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
quite nice but we'll try that out later

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.620 
quite nice but we'll try that out later
that's<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.670> turn<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.330> camera<00:02:24.600> around

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
that's actually turn the camera around

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.020 
that's actually turn the camera around
and<00:02:25.080> then<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.380> see<00:02:25.590> me<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.520> cameraman

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
because it's really here the wide angle

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.920 
because it's really here the wide angle
camera<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.120> also<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.390> had<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.570> colleague<00:02:30.900> in

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
