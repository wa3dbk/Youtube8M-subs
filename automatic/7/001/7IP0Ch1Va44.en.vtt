00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.940
 Paper is made of trees. 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.600
 Recycling 1 ton of paper will save 17 trees. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.720
 The trees are transported to the factory. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 The bark is removed. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 They are cut into small chips. 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.300
 The shavings are mixed with water and "cooked" to a paste. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 The paste is bleached and other chemicals are added to make the paper stronger. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 The paste is rolled and the water is squeezed out of it. 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 The rolled pasta is dried and becomes paper. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 The paper belts are cut into smaller sheets. 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 BUT WAIT! THE PAPER CAN BE RECOVERED TO MAKE A NEW PAPER FROM IT! 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.360
 Instead of chips, once used paper can be used to create a new one. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.600
 The paper mixes with water and "cooks" the paste. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.800
 Recycling paper saves energy related to growing, felling and processing of wood. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.220
 It also helps reduce CO2 emissions and reduce the use of landfills.
