matches<00:00:37.980> well<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.450> tag<00:00:39.690> team

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
matches well because the tag team

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
matches well because the tag team
tournament<00:00:40.200> doesn't<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.860> doesn't<00:00:41.250> let<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
have like as much matches as the first

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
have like as much matches as the first
season<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.570> season<00:00:45.719> had

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
season like I know the first season had

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
season like I know the first season had
like<00:00:46.140> maybe<00:00:46.289> 16<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.670> matches<00:00:48.239> or

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
like maybe 16 different matches or

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
like maybe 16 different matches or
something<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.750> season<00:00:49.350> 2<00:00:49.530> tag<00:00:50.280> team

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
something like that season 2 tag team

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
something like that season 2 tag team
they<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.000> let<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> much<00:00:51.719> matches

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they don't let you do that much matches

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310
