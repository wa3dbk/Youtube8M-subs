00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the friends with full throttle back with the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.280
 next analysis this time 26 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 third in the state france france 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.519
 against spain spain is coming with the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.140
 Recommendation of a 1 1 against finland 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.430
 therefore france has 3 1 against georgia 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 yes won the performance of the two 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.039
 france currently 64 percent as I said 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.650
 last victory in the quali group 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.870
 georgien before few friendlies 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.890
 and in between, so to speak 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 the two played in spain 1 1 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 86% of the Spaniards are against Finland 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 as said that citizens decided and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.670
 before that the tie in the group 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 against france so the hinspiel and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 a 4 0 over- run is Belarus 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.020
 direct duels of the two currently sees 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 so that france five victories 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.630
 spain will only be awarded 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.420
 three and two draws 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.909
 France current group-first with 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 ten points second in Spain with eight 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 points and Spain will be yes I think 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.829
 I do everything as direct 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.439
 qualifiers then drive to the wm 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.810
 allowed 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.079
 yes, but my Spain has already been there 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 a little more water at the moment 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.540
 have to represent with em and wm title and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.509
 so I think it depends 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.460
 a bit more 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:53.480
 yes the scorers for France 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.240
 currently ribéry abou diaby djourou 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.650
 Christophe Charlier and Etienne Capoue 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.120
 all with one gate there are then 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.120
 protect three more because the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.910
 right now not listed 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.899
 in spain, that's obvious 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:14.670
 narrow from three gates by the man 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.720
 from fc barcelona pedro 2 from sergio 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.290
 ramos on by soldado and one by jordi 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.700
 alba yes generally the duels of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 France are falling very far 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.100
 so sometimes more like three gates times 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.450
 below spain looks like it 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.910
 rather, that currently less gates 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.700
 fall 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.530
 as I said last day has then 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 france spain again in the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 Group phase overhauled in quali 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.380
 group and is therefore currently on course 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.970
 direct qualification to the cadres 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.459
 probably still in spain too 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.380
 call that casillas hurt I know 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.269
 that just not at all against 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.700
 finland in the gate monument becomes because 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:11.489
 that may have been good too 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.989
 of course be good or diego lópez 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.989
 I do not know if they nominate you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.660
 In any case France believes so far 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.530
 without injury concerns like me 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.940
 can remember 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:35.510
 Of course, when it's time for caballé 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:38.640
 ribery then again it still believes 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.930
 locked far as I know have also 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.310
 safety an interesting man 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.930
 as well as sakko from the pc in spain there 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.829
 is really really big cinema 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.209
 announced he played the usual system 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.760
 I think they will be four again 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.580
 play three and then midfield me 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.080
 think so 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 fábregas and alonso storm pedro iniesta 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.150
 I know who plays in the middle or 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:13.850
 Soldado depends on it in the defense 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:16.420
 Then I think he will borrow 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.840
 ramos I think then left alba and 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.910
 right but jurassic I guess I was 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 I'm not so sure right then im 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.140
 Tor depends on how you become now 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.170
 that gives confidence and therefore mine 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.650
 tip for the game is a 2 1 victory of 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.650
 Spain
