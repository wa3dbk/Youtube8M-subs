kind of probably would have been nice it

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.310 
kind of probably would have been nice it
again<00:04:19.880> at<00:04:19.969> least<00:04:20.030> one<00:04:20.299> more<00:04:20.450> rooster<00:04:20.870> but<00:04:21.109> I

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
again at least one more rooster but I

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.740 
again at least one more rooster but I
feel<00:04:21.919> that<00:04:22.099> the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
feel that the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.090 
feel that the
was<00:04:22.870> still<00:04:23.110> pretty<00:04:23.380> good<00:04:23.590> value<00:04:23.890> for<00:04:23.920> the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
was still pretty good value for the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.520 
was still pretty good value for the
money<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.340> was<00:04:24.490> paid<00:04:24.670> for<00:04:24.730> it<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.410> only

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
money that was paid for it but the only

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.740 
money that was paid for it but the only
real<00:04:26.770> concern<00:04:27.010> now<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.430> going<00:04:27.880> into<00:04:28.180> after

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
real concern now is going into after

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.080 
real concern now is going into after
seeing<00:04:28.960> how<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.410> boxes<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.920> distributed<00:04:30.580> with

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
seeing how the boxes is distributed with

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.640 
seeing how the boxes is distributed with
something<00:04:31.540> incredibly<00:04:31.930> good<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.260> some<00:04:32.440> being

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
something incredibly good and some being

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
something incredibly good and some being
incredibly<00:04:32.920> incredibly<00:04:33.820> bad<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.600> really

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
incredibly incredibly bad it really

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.850 
incredibly incredibly bad it really
brings<00:04:34.900> into<00:04:35.140> question<00:04:35.170> how<00:04:35.590> good<00:04:35.770> an

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
brings into question how good an

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.430 
brings into question how good an
investment<00:04:36.310> single<00:04:36.730> boxes<00:04:37.120> are<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.960> cases

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
investment single boxes are like a cases

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.720 
investment single boxes are like a cases
was<00:04:38.800> really<00:04:39.040> good<00:04:39.160> because<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.700> can

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
was really good because you can

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.040 
was really good because you can
guarantee<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.480> money<00:04:40.630> will<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.810> made

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
guarantee that the money will be made

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.470 
guarantee that the money will be made
back<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.440> spent<00:04:41.890> on<00:04:42.010> this<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.180> single

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
back all spent on this but on single
