I know your roads are in Europe so
they're<00:01:04.809> all<00:01:04.900> intertwined<00:01:05.230> we<00:01:05.710> have<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:17.140> of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
they're all intertwined we have first of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.730 

a<00:01:43.610> new<00:01:44.610> 31

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:12.390 
to show people how to drive up they just
it's<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.440> different

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.040 

I<00:02:12.430> mean<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.849> bring<00:02:13.000> over<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:13.269> skills

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.440 

and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.500> spend<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.950> 12<00:02:18.280> hours<00:02:18.460> without

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and then you spend like 12 hours without

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
and then you spend like 12 hours without
the<00:02:19.690> phone

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the phone

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.300 
the phone
when<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.970> started

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
when you started

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
when you started
ever<00:02:24.880> feel

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.990 

like<00:02:36.650> anything

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.550 

I<00:02:40.060> mean<00:02:40.660> there<00:02:40.780> isn't

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.870 

breakthrough<00:02:45.560> technology

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.220 

but<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.240> soon<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.570> break<00:02:54.750> down<00:02:54.930> there's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
but as soon as you break down there's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.660 
but as soon as you break down there's
not<00:02:55.290> truck<00:02:55.500> driver<00:02:55.710> for<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:55.950> power<00:02:56.250> then<00:02:56.550> you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
not truck driver for that power then you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.100 
not truck driver for that power then you
start<00:02:56.880> already

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
start already

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.720 
start already
can<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.770> take<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.550> as

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
can you take that there's like as

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:25.440 
can you take that there's like as
waffles

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.860 

it's<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:27.099> states<00:03:28.099> they<00:03:28.910> are<00:03:29.060> not<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:29.629> that

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
it's like states they are not like that

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's like states they are not like that
an<00:03:30.080> elastomeric<00:03:30.769> kind<00:03:31.099> of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
an elastomeric kind of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.030 
an elastomeric kind of
why<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.349> I<00:03:33.530> think<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
why is it like that I think the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:04:04.000 
why is it like that I think the
different<00:03:34.400> you'd<00:03:34.519> be<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.879> we<00:03:35.000> don't

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.570 

energy<00:04:05.010> efficiency

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.130 

because<00:04:11.580> place<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> here<00:04:12.180> when<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:12.960> say

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
because place is here when you can say

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.100 
because place is here when you can say
in<00:04:13.380> New<00:04:13.620> York<00:04:14.250> or<00:04:14.430> saving<00:04:14.820> money<00:04:15.000> then<00:04:15.990> of

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
in New York or saving money then of

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:55.510 
in New York or saving money then of
course<00:04:16.320> me<00:04:16.530> you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.210 

mine<00:04:56.090> doesn't<00:04:56.330> know<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.960> run<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.259> problem

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220

by not starting over
kind<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.440> more<00:05:04.590> important<00:05:05.040> but<00:05:06.030> yeah<00:05:06.180> we're

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360
