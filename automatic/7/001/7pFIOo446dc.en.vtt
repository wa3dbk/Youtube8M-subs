00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.679
 joh sc heerenveen fc emmen plays at home tonight against pawn band performs 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.779
 heerenveen is tenth on the list of performances of jans has indicated 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.779
 like to end up in the left row 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.519
 the first option in the competition is for visitors 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.400
 this is a good action in the role of ronnie reniers and then there is jasper 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.929
 waalkens the number ten of the tilburgers 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.380
 but his attempt goes just wide 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.930
 when no understanding geert arend roorda in the base and also herman oosterhaar day 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.260
 is in the field from the beginning 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.300
 but it's not running the first twenty with the home team here again 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.659
 a possibility for the tilburgers the striker pity 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.659
 from the intersection that the ball beats the information 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 little happens at all yet tip the initial phase 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370
 Heerenveen has never been close to the opponent's goal 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 been 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.820
 maybe now 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.690
 king with good action 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.110
 king via lozada on breda 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.460
 what could be better than 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.480
 breda cani shoot the day better what a great goal by venlo at the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.140
 followers stiff in the intersection shot the keeper completely without chance 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.759
 and so now there is a part after two minutes of playing 23 minutes 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.130
 and if the first peel attempt is made, then you are right away 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 and that it has something you can handle them 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
 heerenveen is gradually getting better in the game 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.060
 the good one two with 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.530
 with the roorda and that schothans ban who coo van has a good left but 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.690
 he has a little less fortunate than his predecessor two days 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.350
 ron jans attentive spectator he will be this new trainer from next year 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.040
 heerenveen 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.950
 two were then in counterattack 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 strong action came from the dike 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.860
 reynaers training is upstairs comes too late with a sliding and then it says 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 kruistum again a possibility for him 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.860
 but the striker at willem2 has not really got the sights on it yet 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 first half 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.170
 Willem 2 lost last week still disappointing from hake a closing 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 young helmond sport they fight against relegation 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.739
 absolutely not lose in the team due to natural course 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.489
 but then there should hardly be it as it does here 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.329
 lima breda the keeper so then because in trouble but it would not fit me 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.049
 cannot profit from that 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.109
 and thus escapes with the two with 2 0 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.510
 and then here lima can't make the mistake that you see closer to the equalizer 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.549
 a bit of bad luck also for the defender of willem 2 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.959
 this is the second half 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.810
 prima purple or asia samir fazli shoots lozada exempt that's it 2 0 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.209
 fiftieth minute

 fem de argentijn hernan losada medvedev it is the library it is the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 better team 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.010
 but two minutes later 4 we get the two one 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.730
 and so with the two is back in the competition 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.660
 The cross is from Thomas Veragen and Piet purchases from Berend Jan van Dijk 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.739
 next year is under contract with fc groningen 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:16.399
 free kick after rico wolves who can make diplomacy make this attempt 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.399
 really not in 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.699
 we want two more or less 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.719
 beautiful ball from van dijk I already finished a beautiful one by jelle van kruijssen 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.979
 in the first half he already had a number of good options in one 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:33.689
 hit 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.650
 did not use it, but it just shoots back but directly from the kick-off 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.279
 pavel chest is sent away here 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.879
 Goalkeeper may have to deal with Pato collision chance Kieviet Heerenveen on 3 2

 time enjoy the 2 benefits of the equalizer 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.859
 barely ten seconds later he has it again on the other side 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.999
 and then we have a lot of citizens I have a lot of space 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.249
 noorda 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:01.009
 how to get stuck a second hornet with the 4 2 yes for work the bike
