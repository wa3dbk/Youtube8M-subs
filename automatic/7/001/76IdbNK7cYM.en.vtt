00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
you're gonna hit we're gonna hit this

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.170 
you're gonna hit we're gonna hit this
note<00:03:38.950> here<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.310> twelfth<00:03:39.610> fret<00:03:39.760> fifth

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
note here on the twelfth fret fifth

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.930 
note here on the twelfth fret fifth
string<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:41.430> we're<00:03:42.430> hitting<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.700> there

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
string and we're hitting it there

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.390 
string and we're hitting it there
because<00:03:43.120> we're<00:03:43.600> going<00:03:43.840> into<00:03:43.930> something<00:03:44.200> else

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
because we're going into something else

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:54.450 
because we're going into something else
so<00:03:45.400> let's<00:03:46.090> try<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.330> sing<00:03:46.990> apart<00:03:53.100> use<00:03:54.100> my<00:03:54.250> ring

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
so let's try that sing apart use my ring

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:07.210 
so let's try that sing apart use my ring
finger<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> can<00:03:55.840> go<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.200> next<00:03:56.320> base<00:03:56.530> now

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.290 

it<00:04:08.220> goes<00:04:08.340> into<00:04:08.490> that<00:04:10.460> if<00:04:11.460> you<00:04:11.610> hold<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.120> no

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
it goes into that if you hold that no

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.960 
it goes into that if you hold that no
let<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.230> ring<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.520> beginning<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
let it ring into the beginning of the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:28.280 
let it ring into the beginning of the
