00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.290
 So as we do it I'll do 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.090
 sweet recipe made from fruit leather 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.060
 so free leather is actually 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.490
 impolite smoke that we realized with 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.279
 raw fruits on mix and we spread 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.800
 in a thin layer it makes one like 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.890
 leather in fact it can be worked from the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.890
 way 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.470
 now I pass field leather so 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 it's still twenty six pretty girls 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 fresh directly browser 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.199
 genÃ¨ve a gram of almond priest that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.800
 I made home in the blender for 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:53.030
 they consist in grace he adds 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.120
 symptoms of honey and fresh figs not 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.110
 necessarily sweet enough for art this 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.110
 case 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.410
 so the mixer 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.520
 my roots I have so much leather on the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 special plate that allows the fangs of 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.229
 grids so we would not get even 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.380
 result with parchment paper that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.700
 actually hangs when taking off 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 it's really specific plates 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.649
 so the general again so always 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.390
 taking good care to have a 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.390
 thickness or never 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.350
 so I wish you can 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.660
 bake it I was going to dehydrate a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.740
 half an hour associated and then three 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.740
 half hours at 25 degrees 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.570
 we saw very violet it is the whole 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.550
 the flesh and pulp that were 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.300
 mixed it gives that color there very 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.300
 very flexible to do what you want 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.629
 so here I went to the leather wool of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.140
 fruit with figs to make my 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:39.370
 said reverse slippers use it to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.750
 the cookie cutter what we want so I 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.750
 knife cutting 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.510
 here 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:21.720
 today is the evening of dough 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:25.349
 pistachio half a circle and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.150
 then I close it just by pressing 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.799
 with fingers like those based on 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.349
 fruit it flows by itself and the mud that 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:39.110
 it makes me a leather slippers 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.110
 figs stuffed with pistachio cream
