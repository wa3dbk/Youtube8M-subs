00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 welcome there intense and dizzy reed 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.810
 We will make a fantastic trip into a computer 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.119
 sign up your belts 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.119
 always seemed to fly 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 this year 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.970
 two 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 mockus 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 if james inside the bag 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.290
 since 2002 to discuss with your fingers me and your children 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.190
 the grid is transformed 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 that image act 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760
 incredible but true 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.950
 there are more we investigate that already tried 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 just as it sounds 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 for herrera 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 they inform us the movements of the cursor on the screen 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 throw 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.830
 these mobile 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.230
 instructions are produced that will be processed by the online community 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 let's keep going 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.730
 we are flying over the card 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.730
 I always wanted to see what's on the hard drive 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.000
 ricci a great library 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 let's see 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 Pistons can write stories and save them permanently 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.649
 it seems he wants to say 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.279
 Hates what brings you 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.739
 and if you excuse me 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.120
 it's a second nothing more 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
 we're leaving 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.770
 every time he finishes his troop 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.959
 the guards on the hard drive to bring it back in the future 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.540
 however, while you are working on it, another type of memory is used 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.119
 which is smaller but much faster 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.119
 it's called ram memory let's take a look 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.139
 the sound card a video card 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 there are the ram memory chips 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.480
 Your temporality temporary designs are according to the data that the user uses 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.319
 they have focused on chillÃ¡n san francisco the data that are transferred 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.650
 consellera sanchez 10 gold discs we have been reiterative world 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.780
 Honduras is irreversible side of the rises in the communities 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:13.449
 losing is a matter of his is an affair or the kiss of December 2012 we render a 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.620
 government 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.269
 but about the whole world 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.159
 distribution of points between 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.719
 little by little poverty 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.749
 the actor 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.749
 that truth becomes sound card 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.589
 it seems that one walks painted well here but without children's drawing 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.629
 the fines are interrupted the repertoire 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.669
 let's find where the next one originates 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.269
 let's start with the process 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.269
 finally the computer 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.739
 what happened and the psoe 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.989
 majano 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.389
 it seems that here is high 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.339
 and this character 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.339
 aspects uu this gigantic hundred 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.150
 now maybe yes 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
 asking for more time 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.739
 they are musical notes 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.819
 its music 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.069
 and those processed and 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.349
 until early transport one of the characters 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.999
 they think that by racconto 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.999
 now I understand why they have reported to music 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.300
 and leave everything lying down and those colors are going crazy 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.800
 and there are those who point murcia 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 result in a catastrophic image 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.169
 about if someone wants to communicate 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.400
 nor dream of tariffs 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 and connect to the internet in a way 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.189
 slowly 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.699
 everything is too slow 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.300
 they are asking you more than you can give 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.990
 It has been a field to finish 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.069
 can not do everything at once 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.639
 this processed reported 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.599
 can not effectively carry out all the operations entrusted to it and 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.599
 even less if you must process them all at the same time 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.559
 let's get out of justice 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.139
 someone has a humor of firefighters 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.490
 turn off this incident 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
 with the intel pentium 4 processor 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.499
 all its citizens 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.990
 This is something else 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.349
 intel pentium 4 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.349
 this adds to your control 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.550
 now deceased and capitalize on the full potential of the team 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.319
 You can run many applications at the same time without compromising the 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.319
 team performance 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.789
 still here what you want 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.889
 can give you 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.270
 little more 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.930
 is powerful enough to process many tasks in a fluid way and 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.199
 at the same time 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.199
 for cameron multitasking 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.069
 an intel pentium 4 processor 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.219
 look at your computer for the performance you need 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.389
 no matter how old you are with a computer with the intel processor 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.389
 pentium 4 was someone removed camera 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.860
 create danger 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.559
 make music 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.939
 organized 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.210
 study paint 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.419
 decide 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.960
 investigate progress activity communicate 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:22.259
 inform 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:23.889

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.319
 impec touch dream 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:30.490
 get ready to discover a new world 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.750
 a world without borders where you will be amazed more and more 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.219
