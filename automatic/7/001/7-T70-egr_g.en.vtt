00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.330
 in the car often have to connect 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.870
 various 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.210
 growth that help driver 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.219
 video recorder navigator 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.690
 yes all these devices are trying from 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.630
 own chargers which 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.210
 convert 12 volts to 5 and of course 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 not going anywhere from mobile phones 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.510
 which is also sometimes necessary 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.490
 recharge on the road only 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.860
 possible way to charge it all 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.410
 variety of gadgets connect them 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.000
 light a cigarette and it is good if the car is not 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.090
 only a cigarette lighter but a couple 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.880
 rosette 12 but often this luxury is not 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.070
 find therefore on sale there is a huge 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.410
 number of cigarette lighter sockets 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.140
 but they all have one flaw they 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.629
 cumbersome so today we will look at 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.149
 way how to make cars charger 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.230
 the device is miniature and 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.980
 highly effective for this us 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.429
 will need 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.949
 a pulse stabilizer is priceless 026 on 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.109
 5 volts and 2 amps 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.420
 connectors hut and a small amount 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.390
 wires and thermo glue 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.909
 this stabilizer is capable of input 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.010
 voltage 7 and a half to 40 receive 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.520
 five code and at the same time give current 2 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.530
 amps 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
 enough to charge 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 modern tablet or phone 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.369
 since the stabilizer works in 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.439
 pulse mode it has high efficiency and 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 unlike linear stabilizers not 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.130
 needs a large heat sink module 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.299
 made of pay from the aluminum substrate 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.600
 allowing for a long 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.729
 time to shoot output current up to 2 amps 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 without additional heat from here and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.039
 of course modules thermal protection 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.229
 so we take a pulse stabilizer and 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.110
 solder wires to the entrance for 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.930
 connect to the car's network and exit 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 that is, our usb connector into the connector does not 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.520
 only 1 4 leg space is used 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 Solder necessarily fill with hot melt 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.950
 to tidy up the contact do not create yourself 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.219
 connector you can put in any 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 convenient place on the car panel 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.110
 pre-cut size needed 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.040
 holes and pulling wires for 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.530
 further installation now check 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.750
 we give to the input 12 volts at the output we have 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 5 as required 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.400
 also you can use not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 single double connector yusb or 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.870
 take a more powerful stabilizer and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.010
 connect to it immediately three or four 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.010
 connectors as you wish
