00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.250
 hello friends for our coffee pastes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 let's start by dissolving the coffee 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.370
 instant in hot water 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.519
 the butter we put it a moment in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.769
 the microwave and we already have very soft 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.289
 ok let's start incorporating the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.909
 icing sugar that if you can use sugar 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.070
 Normal Yes but it is also the 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.900
 thinner pastas with the sugar 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.150
 we use a rod 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 and little by little we are integrating the sugar 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.300
 ace 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.160
 next you see the coffee that we have 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.910
 dissolved previously we incorporated it 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.250
 We also continue to shine that 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.680
 integrate everything well 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 Well, we already have a little salt 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.050
 little alcohol is always good because 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.550
 in 10 streams they say true 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.530
 for eggs 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.910
 and we will continue integrating it is good that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.580
 everything is approximately the same 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.590
 temperature 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.660
 why then because if the eggs go in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 too cold to solidify the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.760
 butter that we have integrated before 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.160
 well we already have it we are already finishing 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.300
 to sift the flour we incorporate the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.210
 almond powder and mix well 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.940
 and now what we are going to do is unite the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.470
 two mixtures on one hand the flour like 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720
 You see with the almond powder and on the other 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.460
 a little more liquid phase 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.890
 eggs butter and others we have 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.480
 integrated previously now you are 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 noting that I have changed the rod 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.860
 I use a wooden spatula to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.980
 this mixture is better to use a spatula 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.590
 of wood looks at a curly mouthpiece of 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.300
 10 you see very well what I'm going to do with 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.220
 she is good I am loading the sleeve 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.870
 pastry because you're going to see that the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.149
 coffee pastes with pastas that are called 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.480
 of bowls is to say with sleeve 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 I'm doing pieces of about 67 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.320
 centimeters and at the end as you see something 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.650
 as well as a little rosette good because 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.340
 us how you like max to the oven 170 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.020
 9 minutes grades are already here that good 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.220
 Pint I'm melting dark chocolate 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 beige a little in the microwave with 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.230
 beware that in those that I mojo a 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.030
 little bit the anp until it slips in that but 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.830
 then after everything is here in this in 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.480
 dow grid that I put on a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.120
 tray so you could retrieve the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.250
 chocolate left over very well as well 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.500
 I do with all 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.450
 is already resting there I have also 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.710
 White chocolate 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.710
 in the microwave 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.400
 and this I'm putting it as you see how 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.410
 a sleeve of these small tasks of 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.570
 decorate good a little at your choice 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.670
 and I do not even think I'll try 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.569
 to be richer than these but you go 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.040
 to save 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.040
 a hug and until next time
