00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 welcome to the bantamweight victim today I propose the tickets 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.299
 very original input 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.160
 we will revisit a dessert to make great salt meadows 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.589
 it's actually small, legal channels for day-to-day training 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.330
 so that the fisc enjoy lukewarm or cold with a salad for example enter 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.510
 sabathé impress your police friends to be satisfactory 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 apart from the following ingredients 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.300
 to 50 grams of fear 100 grams of flour 150 grams of Beaufort that I have 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.130
 cut here into tiny cubes 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.610
 the echo of the ordinons that his relatives under the treated waters in version 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.420
 shredded 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.420
 two others 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.640
 half a liter of semi-skimmed milk 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 a little salt pepper and of course 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.880
 small Akamai molds so here silicone day 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.109
 it's the simplest 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.510
 to begin 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.290
 to start it's very simple we will take the lez 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 and wear it 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 at the show with the butter you 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 his title 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.840
 medium heat 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.850
 I go 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 I add the butter 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.140
 and let you quietly do the ball for the purpose 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370
 in this file 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.650
 to continue the recipe it turns out that I have so 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 900 grams of flour 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.920
 alain fouché 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.570
 and the yellow 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 second nine 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.230
 its furnishings 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.560
 for this contest 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 and I doubt the second yellow 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.290
 you mix everything you need to remember 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 6 it means 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.600
 6 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 6 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.009
 the future 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.009
 just now to face this date 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 judicial bullfather 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.660
 here are the first tremors 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.050
 I was a little crazy 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.290
 and then I'll use 2% example and mix 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.949
 and afraid to relax a little 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.259
 the first pool preparation 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.319
 in the opposite direction a little bit 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.399
 and I continued to eat well 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.299
 its foundation 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.309
 ouattara 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 so it's fully incorporated it was open 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.399
 until you get a smooth paste 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.929
 so if you ever have any pounds 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929
 you do not hesitate to renegotiate your dough concerning 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.839
 it must be good that she is like this is perfect 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.340
 we will let it warm up so ideal 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.620
 this is the bank should be so our comfort of other things in there 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.239
 it is clear that the ticket 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.590
 it's to leave her cool for an hour so she can tell 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.599
 is that flour so the v6 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.990
 the preparation here I find again in the meanwhile I'm going 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.679
 senators 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.649
 prevents your oven to 210 becquerels 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.149
 the little leather truck after 45 minutes 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.849
 so for the rest of the recipe 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.849
 so I take the chiffonnade de chozeau 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.909
 he is really 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.909
 cut in small solemn 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.509
 here are seven minutes of network show 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.989
 so we will add 5 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.189
 the hot and the cold another passer that he has more time 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.819
 dispatched a little since earlier 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.430
 so if you have no signs show no beaufort you can 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.609
 replace with county for example 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.479
 the problem is really 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.899
 if you do not have a lot of choice you have to say that guys are training me to 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.019
 make 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.159
 and after you congratulate and much for our imagination 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.309
 it can be something else than the others or movement 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.359
 of course 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.359
 so here in the case of necessity not again remix 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.870
 if you ever have a few pounds of gold 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.159
 the budget 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.159
 the euro zone beaufort 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.379
 in particular 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.340
 you must also try to remember if you wish 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.340
 we will indeed more melted 20 referee m 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.289
 in water 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.289
 a small round of points 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.979
 ajs portoise 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.390
 17 pm we have to do everything if we have a guided tour in small 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.290
 stalls 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.259
 calm 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.259
 that's how it happens 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.789
 visit 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.800
 for m you liked 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.130
 one of the best feathers 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.350
 more classic with why not small the little mushroom is the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.759
 seventh time in eight days 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.999
 they have 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.249
 there is 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.159
 at this point you have no base 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.509
 then can 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.509
 to be a little creative without problem 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 for what I did to the announced of their whole but small world here 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.279
 we will see who knows 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.309
 so of course we have it 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:41.919
 and if envied to two-thirds 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 no more 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.809
 still goes so well 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:50.809
 of success 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.689
 people who cough more gray 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.689
 I hear it fucking a 110-degree loan swap 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.960
 forty-five minutes and another instead 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.300
 after 45 58 power stations of senelec 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.990
 and gary mcaliley health 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.340
 we can simply advise you to let them warm up management 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.199
 funds 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.120
 and let warm in their dishes and then we can do it to get 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.499
 ensure he is so very general unfolds pretty well look 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.469
 mike myers prime time on m6 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.819
 in this direction 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.309
 you let cool in montpellier it's a good 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:33.209
 but since then I have proceeded in the same way in all cases and then 

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.539
 old 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:37.349
 gold 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.800
 he had gone back to witchcraft 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.129

 and for 100 euros in the short term he adds to very soon on the 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:52.080
 region 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.759
 no plos one
