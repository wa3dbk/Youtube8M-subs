00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.590
 i 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.800
 hello to everyone, welcome to 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.870
 a new spore video but no no 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.950
 we are in the adventure today we are going to do 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:23.860
 a new creation of creatures so 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.060
 come on let's the creator of creatures 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.340
 I have decided that we are going to make a new 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.239
 episode of is creating pokemon because 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.620
 there are thousands of millions of pokemon or more and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.970
 I love them, so from time to time 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.220
 when you already know that I like to vary 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.500
 I have a Pokémon series and a dragon level 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.570
 ball series of aliens and me that 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 I know very strange things and today I thought that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.390
 let's make the 3 birds or birds 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.620
 legendary than me loved me let 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.610
 to do art 1 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.800
 Adam 2 and love 3 I do not know how they will look like 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.079
 better are some made to benefits 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.860
 the poor people with beautiful and beautiful 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.680
 they are but the best is something cool and 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.799
 moderately similar let's start 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.320
 with an article the ice bird that 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.090
 I think it was one of my favorites I think 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.080
 that was the one I liked so 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.700
 come on, let's go 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 it will be article 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.619
 i 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 two 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499
 to 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.090
 and here we have the great article god 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.130
 how nice is this the tail should 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 be longer and more blue but it is that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 there are more things as I always say do 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.800
 what I have with I do what I can with 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.080
 what I have but hey component 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.110
 Pretty man has meat for people 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.090
 see the operator but what I do not remember 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.410
 that he had a combo of an attack that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.390
 killed in one blow because I have been 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.700
 flawed and pokemon ximo I have spent 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.890
 almost everyone and had an attack killed from 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.960
 a blow the uncle was the most I think that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
 is the most powerful of all had a 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.940
 attack that was called polar cold that yes 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.260
 we teach him another attack and my mother 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 this is making a pokemon talk 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.860
 but well you learn those that do not 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 you know if with videos the cold attack 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.700
 polar with another who learned that he 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.500
 I called telepath, killed one blow 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.620
 the final fight that's why I like it 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.200
 More more article is the best to see art 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.610
 one I was afraid of a roar a roar 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.610
 from hell come 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.110
 but how bad is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:55.150
 the super trampling article that you do to 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.150
 the bug-like pokemon 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.390
 and destroys it like a good ball, let's go 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.360
 to the next in second place 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.760
 let's make two the legendary bird 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.070
 electric flying guy I think apart 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
 that I like more article and such 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.640
 I think these two were the best of the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.740
 three because basically he was kind 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320
 electric and was faster than the others 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.560
 so he fell thunder and the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.180
 burst but well let's try 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.040
 do it my mother I'm giving a lot 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 pokemon talks of attacks and those 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.980
 things is going very good with 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.980
 jana pokemon 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:59.980
 also serve as an instrument to be of 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.110
 the caverns of hell my god data 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.260
 dice with the pimps that you are that you 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.170
 what have I done to you that I have made you see 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.910
 people the same as before I do what 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.520
 I can really tell you because there is no 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.890
 wings the one with beak wings that 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.989
 can not be done with anything from 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.230
 this game really and good so 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.230
 the rest 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.630
 let's leave the packaging that emits a 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.290
 data laughter which is what happens 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.760
 when you appear in public what is it that 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.760
 do other people when they see you 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.569
 they are descojonan of habilitation to see 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.770
 truth 2 what is the high of funds 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.770
 that the most of a ray 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.650
 calm quiet on facebook is 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.860
 diego milito and kicking 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.710
 Well, here we have roasts, we are going to 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.539
 go for the last and last is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.449
 of course we are going to make the bird of 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.750
 legendary fire love 3 was the most 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.930
 beautiful of all is that it goes by the 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.580
 heaven myself if not going through the sky 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.289

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.210
 legendary birds is that I love them 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.930
 It has not been returned to a generation 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.520
 as the first pokemon really that 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.759
 they were the best we are going to do the 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.759
 sheath 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:50.350
 and here we have the magnificent and majestic 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.440
 the 3 if the wings are missing 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.750
 fire that your head catches fire and 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.660
 that the tail is lent little but already what 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.580
 I can make it catch fire 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.820
 yes but I can put it here on fire in 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.250
 the nest of the volcano that has in the game 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.260

 the theme love 3 that cool man 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.980
 It was not too bad if it could be 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.830
 put fire because it would be much more 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.910
 better but look how I can not get it 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.240
 fire again and a minimum that died 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:28.120
