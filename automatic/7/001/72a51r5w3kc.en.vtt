I<00:00:25.529> mean<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.769> impossible<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.609> stretch<00:00:27.060> like

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I mean it's impossible for stretch like

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
I mean it's impossible for stretch like
that<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.410> influence<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.039> outcome<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that not to influence the outcome of the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.859 
that not to influence the outcome of the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
side of a run like that there's not a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
side of a run like that there's not a
whole<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.899> you'll<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.649> soon
