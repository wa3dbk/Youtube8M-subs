00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 a Chinese mine 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.220
 the first thing is to brown a little 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.220
 little bit of basil diary 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.250

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.910
 of her water to leave a little more

 human can not be much can not be 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.480
 by injury it will not be all just one 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.000

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.390
 Little this funding here in the good old 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.440
 rule here my girl had 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.760
 calabresa to give that sensuality to 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.010

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.869
 what succulent 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.940
 justifications for using the site 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.959
 can hit salt is that I already can 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 off the slum and let give you a 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:29.410
 peek why I'll add that the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.989
 mine for the better to mesos grated for 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.120
 you show who sends you to 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.040
 to be enough to temper is not semi z 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.700
 because the stuffing is pumpkin 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.450
 and frazÃ£o football hole with a touch of 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.489
 Parmesan 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.550
 a camera that gets a thing okay 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.010
 get to the area to stay a clay 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.670
 even if it is not that everything 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.670
 stay clan 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.030
 she dances past now to fill 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.160
 attack is the separate Japanese filling and 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.140
 now you will understand why you have to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.650
 to be a filling a solid 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.680

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.900

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.690
 you have the bags in to make you understand 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.090
 her lasagna batter her well 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.740
 any supermarket of that size 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.300
 and now you put a knife on her side and 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.310
 do so look 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.940

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.540
 square of four so I think I 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.840
 already able is by the mouth will stay in my 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.420
 support table of all summer hits 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.800

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.440
 here I have a pot of water to have 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.570
 one step and I already left so she does not stick 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.430
 there is not a clean thing left 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.790
 they are all plastic underneath 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.720

 I'll get her with oil from the plastic 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:39.300

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.259
 escape the stuffing so it's important 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.680

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.789
