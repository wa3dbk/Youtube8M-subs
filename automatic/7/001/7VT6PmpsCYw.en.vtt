and the corner routes and there are a
lot<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> different<00:01:09.600> ways<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.729> adjust<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.420> to

lot of different ways to adjust or to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.289 
lot of different ways to adjust or to
make<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> coverage<00:01:13.650> look<00:01:13.890> different<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
make the coverage look different in this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
make the coverage look different in this
formation<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.290> formation<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
formation out of any formation at that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
formation out of any formation at that
best<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> middle

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
best of you would like a middle

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
best of you would like a middle
linebacker<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.060> I'm

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
linebacker it's really good but here I'm

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.690 
linebacker it's really good but here I'm
showing<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> replay<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.979> middle

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
showing you a replay of how the middle

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
showing you a replay of how the middle
linebackers<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.240> play<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> middle<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
linebackers they play the middle of the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
linebackers they play the middle of the
field<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> use<00:01:26.100> our<00:01:26.310> free<00:01:26.340> safety<00:01:26.909> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
field so if you use our free safety you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
field so if you use our free safety you
get<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> play<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> deep<00:01:28.110> ball<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
get to play the deep ball and all that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
get to play the deep ball and all that
extra<00:01:29.159> stuff<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
extra stuff so this way you don't get be

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.230 
extra stuff so this way you don't get be
deep<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.970> getting

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
deep and you're not really getting

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
deep and you're not really getting
dotted<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> middle<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> field<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
dotted over the middle of the field and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
dotted over the middle of the field and
we're<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:35.970> rushing<00:01:36.420> three<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> same

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
we're also rushing three at the same

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
we're also rushing three at the same
time<00:01:37.680> by<00:01:38.220> crashing<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> deal<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.360> any

way to the left stops corner routes and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.750 
way to the left stops corner routes and
out<00:05:42.450> routes<00:05:42.720> protecting<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.590> outsides<00:05:43.980> then

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
out routes protecting the outsides then

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.460 
out routes protecting the outsides then
you<00:05:44.910> have<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.360> line<00:05:45.660> back<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.050> right<00:05:46.230> side

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
you have the line back on the right side

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.140 
you have the line back on the right side
of<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.620> field<00:05:46.830> also<00:05:47.160> protecting<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:47.880> corner

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
of the field also protecting the corner

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.850 
of the field also protecting the corner
routes<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.630> out<00:05:48.720> route<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.500> this<00:05:49.650> way<00:05:49.830> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
routes and the out route so this way you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.400 
routes and the out route so this way you
don't<00:05:49.980> have<00:05:50.160> to<00:05:50.250> put<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.550> safety<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:51.410> you're

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
don't have to put the safety and you're

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.810 
don't have to put the safety and you're
this<00:05:52.560> way<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:52.770> don't<00:05:52.830> need<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.280> safety<00:05:53.700> and

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
this way you don't need that safety and

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.640 
this way you don't need that safety and
a<00:05:53.880> yellow<00:05:54.060> each<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:54.600> every<00:05:54.780> time<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.020> can<00:05:55.380> mix

right side of the screen guarding the
tight<00:06:13.410> end<00:06:13.620> so<00:06:14.340> that's<00:06:14.990> basically<00:06:15.990> shut<00:06:16.590> down

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
tight end so that's basically shut down

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
you have to adjust a certain way like

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.530 
you have to adjust a certain way like
snugs<00:06:52.870> has<00:06:53.170> to<00:06:53.260> be<00:06:53.380> just<00:06:53.740> a<00:06:53.830> certain<00:06:54.010> way<00:06:54.540> spray

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
snugs has to be just a certain way spray

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.720 
snugs has to be just a certain way spray
it<00:06:55.600> has<00:06:55.750> to<00:06:55.870> be<00:06:55.960> just<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.350> certain<00:06:56.620> way<00:06:56.800> troops

it has to be just a certain way troops

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.760 
it has to be just a certain way troops
has<00:06:57.910> to<00:06:58.030> be<00:06:58.120> adjusted<00:06:58.210> so<00:06:58.750> trips<00:06:59.380> has<00:06:59.530> to<00:06:59.680> be

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
has to be adjusted so trips has to be

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.210 
has to be adjusted so trips has to be
adjusted<00:06:59.890> a<00:07:00.370> certain<00:07:00.700> way<00:07:00.850> you<00:07:01.480> can<00:07:01.720> adjust

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
adjusted a certain way you can adjust

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.590 
adjusted a certain way you can adjust
the<00:07:03.220> same<00:07:03.490> way<00:07:03.700> with<00:07:03.880> every<00:07:04.240> formation

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
the same way with every formation

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.260 
the same way with every formation
because<00:07:04.870> a<00:07:05.260> lot<00:07:05.710> of<00:07:05.740> formations<00:07:06.340> can<00:07:06.970> attack

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
because a lot of formations can attack

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.640 
because a lot of formations can attack
you<00:07:07.420> in<00:07:07.540> a<00:07:07.630> whole<00:07:07.840> bunch<00:07:08.080> of<00:07:08.200> different<00:07:08.260> ways

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
you in a whole bunch of different ways

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.040 
you in a whole bunch of different ways
and<00:07:10.110> you<00:07:11.110> just<00:07:11.320> have<00:07:11.530> to<00:07:11.800> not<00:07:12.790> get<00:07:13.150> in<00:07:13.270> lab<00:07:13.690> well

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
and you just have to not get in lab well

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.870 
and you just have to not get in lab well
get<00:07:14.320> in<00:07:14.410> the<00:07:14.500> lab<00:07:14.710> and<00:07:14.920> get<00:07:15.010> used<00:07:15.280> to<00:07:15.460> this<00:07:15.580> but

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
get in the lab and get used to this but

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.950
