00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280

 the challenge 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
 so it will not necessarily be very hard 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 more or less the same thing but this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 basic viewfinder zoom adjustable or 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.699
 any viewfinder is like you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.930

 challenge skyheroes it's gone go 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.090
 it's gone the ja I think we can 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.090
 do it 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.960
 do we do that like that and I stay 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.820
 pressed on the viewfinder so that I can 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.590
 everything is aligned like that and I will 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.800
 really invite to do it like that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.570
 also drives your shoot so 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.650
 shit then officer it's too slow he 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.630
 I would have to be concentrated 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:33.009
 in fact so I can not speak at the same 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:33.009
 time to go to whores 1 17 8 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.420
 go pim that's a record 14.5 guys 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.160
 were I here on the shooting stand where 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.750
 I will try to do better than the challenge 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.239
 that I had originally launched that was 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.040
 of 4.8 on the valat the number one 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.900
 I know you have very many at the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.220
 try is really thank you for your 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.410
 participation makes it extremely 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.820
 pleasure and behind I see that a lot 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.380
 who had a hard time with this 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.550
 challenge there but behind it's all the way 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.739
 because it makes your work 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.900
 not a bad fall have galley such as gotaga 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.120
 where I saw that it was a galley 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.860
 but he persevered and finally put 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.200
 the bar at really very very hot 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.310
 by doing 14.6 if I remember correctly 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 I write the province found here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 14.6 so of course I will try 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.010
 to do better than 15.8 since you 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
 was also very numerous to do 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.100
 faster to show you that mam 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.370
 so I can still try to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.230
 make 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 So that's always the principle 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.130
 make a small challenge launch it you 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.840
 answer and I try behind 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.430
 answer that try to make a little 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.049
 little better than you anyway I 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.580
 hopefully see if I get to and from 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.440
 less equalize guy quotas since 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.180
 actually it is very difficult seen 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.769
 the sniper's rearming time of 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.750
 do anyway better deal 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.239
 a death it's true that it's still 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.250
 anyway difficult to do more 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.079
 fast since automatically as I 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.400
 rest pressed we can not say and more 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.410
 quickly then for all 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.360
 people who supposedly did more 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.030
 fast than 14 seconds this is 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
 absolutely not possible with the version 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.600
 walrus 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.860
 normal so if you ever say that 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 you did less than 14 seconds 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.069
 these liars it is not possible 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.680
 damn I learn it fall well 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.680
 Target brothel to go 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.580
 m 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.970
 aaaaah 14,5 my friend in the sewer taga 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.970
 pack up and go home 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.240
 well 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.500
 las vegas i want to say this is 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.450
 really bad that I should have posted 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.340
 the video before but the problem is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.310
 that I have just watched this 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.040
 video there so 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.700
 that it was and rose beat warteck and 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.990
 gotaga he managed to tie my score 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.289
 I really think I finally have the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.020
 to be in mba one you know i mean 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.870
 that's what good and well that's what 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.390
 rose managed to equalize my score and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.300
 a brief I even here I come 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.150
 to try bas to reshuffle my sport and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.380
 I could not manage 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.600
 but I think it's not possible 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.340
 to go much further to less 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.010
 to have another sniper than the walrus 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.590
 even with the basic piece you have 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.010
 since it was not possible to go further 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.520
 far 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.260
 finally more quickly and finally short 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.750
 am still happy that sky rose 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.310
 but equalize because that's how it is 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.310
 we are both there 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.220
 the first place transfer I beat 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.360
 gotta give and take like this and I 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.090
 think that many of you 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 should test still same 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.970
 finally publish it on youtube like that 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.850
 finally like that you get up the 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:30.440
 challenge and you tell me how many 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.510
 time you have you and so here we go 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.910
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.860
 even if 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.250
 even if I was on the verge of beating 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.200
 it's three great legendary players 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.510
 young people even invites them youtuber they 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.130
 are friends with me to realize this 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.770
 video like tango this pastor of the 600 and 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.720
 you will have to test and finally test the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.520
 challenge like that like this is what 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.960
 and so 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.370
 I wish you all 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.650
 we are still a month in fact so 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.729
 enjoy it because the school year is going 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.610
 to arrive very very quickly 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.759
 and I do not like that either go all 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.759
 world
