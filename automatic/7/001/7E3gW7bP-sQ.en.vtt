00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
mean I will be honest like the the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.600

shininess<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.309> funny

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
shininess and all that is a little funny

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.569 
shininess and all that is a little funny
but<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.079> looks<00:00:40.260> pretty<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
but I think it looks pretty good and the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.630 
but I think it looks pretty good and the
best<00:00:41.730> thing<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.980> whether<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
best thing is like whether these are the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
best thing is like whether these are the
final<00:00:44.910> player<00:00:45.270> likenesses<00:00:45.840> you'll<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.800> able

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
final player likenesses you'll be able

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
final player likenesses you'll be able
to<00:00:46.980> find<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.460> ones<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> fan<00:00:48.149> hub

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to find better ones on the fan hub

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
to find better ones on the fan hub
