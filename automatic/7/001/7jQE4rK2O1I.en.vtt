using the template to mark out where it
goes<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.170> her<00:01:40.290> nose<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.950> cut

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
goes now to get her nose right I cut

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
goes now to get her nose right I cut
along<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.880> nose<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.450> along<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> mouth<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
along the nose and along the mouth so I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
along the nose and along the mouth so I
could<00:01:43.619> measure<00:01:43.829> perfectly<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
could measure perfectly where it is and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
could measure perfectly where it is and
then<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.570> painting<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> eye<00:01:46.229> details<00:01:46.829> with

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
then just painting the eye details with

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
then just painting the eye details with
your<00:01:47.460> gel<00:01:47.880> food<00:01:48.119> dyes<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.470> thin<00:01:49.860> brush

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
your gel food dyes and a very thin brush

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.060 
your gel food dyes and a very thin brush
it's<00:01:50.970> quite<00:01:51.509> fiddly<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it's quite fiddly but if you want a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's quite fiddly but if you want a
really<00:01:53.490> nice<00:01:53.640> result<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.659> you're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

if you wanted to make this a little bit

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.250 
if you wanted to make this a little bit
easier<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.240> could<00:01:59.480> just<00:01:59.690> print<00:01:59.930> an<00:02:00.110> image

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
easier you could just print an image

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.740 
easier you could just print an image
onto<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:01.040> printable<00:02:01.310> rice<00:02:01.670> papers<00:02:02.120> but

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
of fondant is fun with me so with her

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.290 
of fondant is fun with me so with her
eyes<00:02:09.590> you're<00:02:09.860> going<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.190> give<00:02:10.399> some<00:02:10.729> purple

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300

petal<00:02:11.570> dust<00:02:11.690> across<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.200> top<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.860> do

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
petal dust across the top you have to do

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.920 
petal dust across the top you have to do
that<00:02:13.250> afterwards<00:02:13.910> because<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> gel<00:02:14.540> food<00:02:14.750> dye

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
that afterwards because the gel food dye

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.900 
that afterwards because the gel food dye
doesn't<00:02:15.170> stick<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.620> top<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.220> then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
doesn't stick on top of it and then

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.580 
doesn't stick on top of it and then
painting<00:02:17.330> her<00:02:17.480> eyebrows<00:02:17.930> with<00:02:18.140> some<00:02:18.320> brown

painting her eyebrows with some brown

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.640 
painting her eyebrows with some brown
and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.820> did<00:02:20.060> her<00:02:20.210> nose<00:02:20.510> shadowing<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.470> her

this gives it a nice definition and it
just<00:02:45.290> brings<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.740> life<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.160> bit

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
just brings it to life a little bit

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
just brings it to life a little bit
better<00:02:46.370> than<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.700> plain<00:02:47.030> painted<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.810> look<00:02:48.250> now

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
