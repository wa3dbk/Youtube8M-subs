00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
quickly because as it cools it'll harden

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
quickly because as it cools it'll harden
up<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.850> no<00:01:03.120> big<00:01:03.300> deal<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> hardens<00:01:04.049> up

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
up there's no big deal if it hardens up

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
up there's no big deal if it hardens up
you<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.650> ahead<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> reheat<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you just go ahead and reheat it but you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
eliminate that no dust mouth necessary

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
eliminate that no dust mouth necessary
right<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> let<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> cool<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
right and I do want to let this cool and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
right and I do want to let this cool and
a<00:01:35.009> piece<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> steel<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.850> hard<00:01:36.090> surface<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a piece of steel or a hard surface and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
a piece of steel or a hard surface and
said<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.680> nice<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> level<00:01:38.159> right

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
said this that's nice and level right

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.929 
said this that's nice and level right
and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> drill<00:01:40.560> press<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and then I have a drill press this is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.660 
and then I have a drill press this is
equipped<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.509> core<00:01:43.470> drill<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> core

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
equipped with a core drill and a core

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
equipped with a core drill and a core
drill<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.030> essentially<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.869> tube<00:01:46.110> with

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
drill is essentially just a tube with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960 
drill is essentially just a tube with
diamond<00:01:46.740> plate<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> end<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
diamond plate on the end of it so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
diamond plate on the end of it so
different<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> regular<00:01:48.689> drill<00:01:49.200> bit<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
different from a regular drill bit that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
different from a regular drill bit that
looks<00:01:49.710> sort<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.159> screw<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
looks sort of like a screw this is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
looks sort of like a screw this is
hollow<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> inside<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.259> hollow<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
hollow on the inside this is hollow in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
hollow on the inside this is hollow in
in<00:01:52.950> sight<00:01:53.390> definitely<00:01:54.390> ways<00:01:54.479> safety<00:01:55.409> glass<00:01:55.590> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in sight definitely ways safety glass is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
in sight definitely ways safety glass is
still<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> could<00:01:56.399> spray<00:01:56.670> water<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
still because it could spray water and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.760 
still because it could spray water and
dirt<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.810> eye<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.320> right

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
dirt into your eye all right

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.609 
dirt into your eye all right
and<00:01:59.280> we'll<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.549> turn<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> going

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and we'll just turn this on get it going

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.740 
and we'll just turn this on get it going
now<00:02:02.609> as<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:02.880> doing<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.479> start

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
now as you're doing it you want to start

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.599 
now as you're doing it you want to start
real<00:02:03.960> slope<00:02:04.289> because<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.799> has<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> flat<00:02:05.159> tip

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
real slope because it has a flat tip

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.169 
real slope because it has a flat tip
it's<00:02:06.179> gonna<00:02:06.329> want<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.630> wiggle<00:02:06.780> okay<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.179> if

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it's gonna want to wiggle okay and if

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's gonna want to wiggle okay and if
you're<00:02:09.330> trying<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.869> accurate

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you're trying to be accurate

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.050 
you're trying to be accurate
light<00:02:12.690> touch<00:02:13.310> can<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.640> milk

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
light touch can you see that milk

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.730 
light touch can you see that milk
peanuts<00:02:15.420> coming<00:02:15.690> out<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.960> hole<00:02:16.140> yeah

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
peanuts coming out of the hole yeah

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.550 
peanuts coming out of the hole yeah
that<00:02:17.160> means<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.520> grinding<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.410> mean<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that means it's grinding I mean as a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
that means it's grinding I mean as a
light<00:02:19.740> pressure<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
light pressure and I like to go and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.760 
light pressure and I like to go and
pulsate<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:23.760> I'm<00:02:23.880> doing<00:02:24.210> when<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> lift<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
pulsate what I'm doing when I lift up is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.860 
pulsate what I'm doing when I lift up is
I'm<00:02:25.950> clearing<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.640> from<00:02:26.790> debris<00:02:27.120> there's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
I'm clearing it from debris there's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.200 
I'm clearing it from debris there's
little<00:02:28.230> dust<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.430> things<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
little dust and things in there so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.790 
little dust and things in there so
you're<00:02:30.600> allowing<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.200> get<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.650> way

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you're allowing it to get out of the way

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.250 
you're allowing it to get out of the way
right<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.900> watch<00:02:34.080> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
right that and I like to watch this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.820 
right that and I like to watch this
world<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:37.340> medium<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.490> light<00:02:38.640> pressure<00:02:39.830> you

you<00:03:18.939> could<00:03:19.090> create<00:03:19.299> use<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.659> create<00:03:19.840> patterns

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
you could create use to create patterns

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.839 
you could create use to create patterns
for<00:03:20.590> Jim<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.980> could<00:03:21.099> make<00:03:21.310> interlocking

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
for Jim you could make interlocking

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.780 
for Jim you could make interlocking
circle<00:03:22.269> pattern<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.900> surface

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
circle pattern on the surface

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.360 
circle pattern on the surface
I<00:03:23.819> do<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.599> an<00:03:24.659> example<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.560> -<00:03:25.769> let's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
I do have an example of that - let's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.860 
I do have an example of that - let's
take<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.579> look<00:03:26.670> while<00:03:26.969> you're<00:03:27.090> drilling

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.149 

this<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.200> one<00:03:30.349> that's<00:03:30.470> drilled<00:03:30.830> all<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.069> way

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
this is one that's drilled all the way

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.990 
this is one that's drilled all the way
through

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
through

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.580 
through
this<00:03:32.120> one<00:03:32.270> took<00:03:32.360> about<00:03:32.570> 40<00:03:32.870> minutes<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.320> would

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
this one took about 40 minutes I would

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.760 
this one took about 40 minutes I would
do<00:03:33.680> about<00:03:33.860> 40<00:03:34.160> minutes<00:03:34.490> then<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.030> one<00:03:35.210> has

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
do about 40 minutes then this one has

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.350 
do about 40 minutes then this one has
the<00:03:36.770> circle<00:03:37.130> just<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.610> surface<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.210> then

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
the circle just on the surface but then

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.640 
the circle just on the surface but then
you<00:03:38.480> drilled<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> side<00:03:39.080> here<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.470> could

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
you drilled the side here so you could

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.940 
you drilled the side here so you could
add<00:03:39.770> beads<00:03:40.010> or<00:03:40.310> dangles<00:03:40.700> here<00:03:40.910> right<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:42.800> we

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
add beads or dangles here right so as we

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.430 
add beads or dangles here right so as we
were<00:03:43.040> talking<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.520> finished<00:03:43.850> alright<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.290> you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
were talking we finished alright and you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.760 
were talking we finished alright and you
can<00:03:45.590> do<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.740> pour<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:46.190> off<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.560> just

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
can do just pour this off so you just

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.940 
can do just pour this off so you just
don't<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.070> not<00:03:49.190> your<00:03:49.340> muddy<00:03:49.520> water<00:03:49.760> mm-hmm<00:03:50.270> I

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
don't be not your muddy water mm-hmm I

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.470 
don't be not your muddy water mm-hmm I
never<00:03:51.950> take<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.190> look<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:53.030> see<00:03:53.209> there's<00:03:53.390> our

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
never take a look you see there's our

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.320 
never take a look you see there's our
hole<00:03:54.100> now<00:03:55.100> actually<00:03:55.400> what<00:03:55.520> if<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> stop<00:03:56.120> by

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
hole now actually what if you stop by

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.360 
hole now actually what if you stop by
halfway<00:03:56.720> through<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.740> can<00:03:57.920> see<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.130> can<00:03:58.250> see

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
halfway through you can see you can see

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.699 
halfway through you can see you can see
the<00:03:58.520> core<00:03:58.790> still<00:03:59.150> left<00:03:59.360> there<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.410> that's<00:04:00.530> kind

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the core still left there so that's kind

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.060 
the core still left there so that's kind
of<00:04:00.740> neat

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
of neat

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.170 
of neat
that<00:04:01.220> could<00:04:01.370> create<00:04:01.520> some<00:04:01.700> really

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
that could create some really

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.880 
that could create some really
interesting<00:04:02.420> design<00:04:02.810> possibilities<00:04:03.380> too

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
interesting design possibilities too

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.620 
interesting design possibilities too
definitely<00:04:04.459> how<00:04:04.580> do<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.730> get<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:04.970> out<00:04:05.150> if

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
definitely how do you get this out if

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.850 
definitely how do you get this out if
you<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.900> warm<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.170> up<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.560> warm<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.830> back

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
you have to warm it up just warm it back

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.729 
you have to warm it up just warm it back
up<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> same<00:04:07.760> pot<00:04:07.970> it'll<00:04:08.540> go<00:04:08.630> maybe<00:04:09.260> wait<00:04:09.650> a

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
up in the same pot it'll go maybe wait a

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.740 
up in the same pot it'll go maybe wait a
minute<00:04:09.980> or<00:04:10.100> two<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.459> it'll<00:04:10.910> play<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.720> can

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
minute or two and it'll play and you can

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.229 
minute or two and it'll play and you can
just<00:04:12.140> totally<00:04:12.530> reuse<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.950> all<00:04:13.850> right<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.150> you

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
just totally reuse it all right and you

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.670 
just totally reuse it all right and you
can<00:04:14.420> do<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.630> same<00:04:14.810> process<00:04:15.050> with<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.470> shell

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
can do the same process with the shell

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.699 
can do the same process with the shell
yeah<00:04:16.220> do<00:04:17.060> me<00:04:17.090> show<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.359> yeah<00:04:17.780> all<00:04:18.109> right<00:04:18.260> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
yeah do me show you yeah all right the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.050 
yeah do me show you yeah all right the
shell<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.040> got<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.220> little<00:04:19.400> different<00:04:19.549> system

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
shell I got a little different system

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.659 
shell I got a little different system
only<00:04:20.660> because<00:04:20.959> shells<00:04:21.230> can<00:04:21.410> be<00:04:21.470> delicate<00:04:21.769> and

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
only because shells can be delicate and

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.860 
only because shells can be delicate and
I<00:04:22.850> don't<00:04:23.000> want<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> push<00:04:23.330> them<00:04:23.510> into<00:04:23.660> that

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
I don't want to push them into that

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.550 
I don't want to push them into that
putty<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.590> have<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> sponge<00:04:25.790> in<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.320> yogurt<00:04:27.320> Cup

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
putty I have a sponge in a yogurt Cup

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.020 
putty I have a sponge in a yogurt Cup
and<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.490> works<00:04:28.640> really<00:04:28.790> well

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and it works really well

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.730 
and it works really well
let<00:04:29.180> me<00:04:29.240> get<00:04:29.360> glasses<00:04:29.720> back<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.470> shell

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
let me get glasses back on and shell

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.100 
let me get glasses back on and shell
will<00:04:30.890> take<00:04:31.070> really<00:04:31.540> hardly<00:04:32.540> any<00:04:32.750> time<00:04:32.870> at<00:04:33.020> all

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
will take really hardly any time at all

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.400 
will take really hardly any time at all
do<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.530> put<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.830> under<00:04:34.010> water<00:04:34.220> as<00:04:34.460> well<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:35.410> do

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
do you put this under water as well I do

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.120 
do you put this under water as well I do
and<00:04:36.860> have<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.880> raise<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.770> which<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:39.919> nice

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
and have to raise this which is nice

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.130 
and have to raise this which is nice
because<00:04:40.880> you'll<00:04:41.210> have<00:04:41.360> different<00:04:41.720> thickness

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
because you'll have different thickness

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.560 
because you'll have different thickness
as<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.320> material<00:04:42.940> make<00:04:43.940> sure<00:04:44.060> that's<00:04:44.240> gonna<00:04:44.360> go

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
as a material make sure that's gonna go

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.200 
as a material make sure that's gonna go
all<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> way<00:04:44.780> down<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.500> will<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.729> I'm<00:04:47.090> just

all the way down it will so I'm just

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.110 
all the way down it will so I'm just
gonna<00:04:47.360> put<00:04:47.600> right<00:04:47.720> here<00:04:47.750> at<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.020> top

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
gonna put right here at the top

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.190 
gonna put right here at the top
okay<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.300> when<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.479> push<00:04:50.720> down<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.990> see<00:04:51.110> the

okay and when I push down and see the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.870 
okay and when I push down and see the
water<00:04:51.380> acts<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:51.830> oh<00:04:51.979> that's<00:04:52.400> right<00:04:52.610> your

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
water acts like oh that's right your

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.969 
water acts like oh that's right your
sponge<00:04:53.180> both<00:04:53.390> protects<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.110> even<00:04:54.680> provides

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
sponge both protects and even provides

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.750 
sponge both protects and even provides
