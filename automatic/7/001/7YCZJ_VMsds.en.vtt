based<00:00:20.079> off<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.550> first<00:00:21.820> four<00:00:22.119> rounds<00:00:22.300> he

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
based off of the first four rounds he

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.600 
based off of the first four rounds he
gave<00:00:23.650> Adrian<00:00:25.320> he<00:00:26.320> tended<00:00:26.829> to<00:00:27.009> fade<00:00:27.399> out<00:00:27.430> a

gave Adrian he tended to fade out a

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.700 
gave Adrian he tended to fade out a
little<00:00:27.849> bit<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.329> in<00:00:28.750> my<00:00:28.899> opinion<00:00:29.020> he<00:00:29.379> threw

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
little bit and in my opinion he threw

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.619 
little bit and in my opinion he threw
too<00:00:29.890> many<00:00:30.070> body<00:00:30.340> shots<00:00:30.700> instead<00:00:31.329> of<00:00:31.419> head

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 
too many body shots instead of head

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.630 
too many body shots instead of head
shots<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.410> he<00:00:32.829> was<00:00:32.950> disappointed<00:00:33.309> with<00:00:33.579> the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
shots and he was disappointed with the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.100 
shots and he was disappointed with the
decision<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:34.300> think<00:00:34.539> if<00:00:34.750> he<00:00:34.840> would<00:00:34.899> have<00:00:34.960> gone

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
decision I think if he would have gone

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.540 
decision I think if he would have gone
to<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.379> head<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.559> little<00:00:35.770> bit<00:00:35.920> more<00:00:36.250> and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
to the head a little bit more and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.040 
to the head a little bit more and
calculated<00:00:37.149> more<00:00:37.270> power<00:00:37.480> shots<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:37.960> head

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
calculated more power shots to the head

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.020 
calculated more power shots to the head
maybe<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:39.160> judges<00:00:39.399> would<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.699> gave<00:00:39.820> him<00:00:39.910> a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
maybe the judges would it gave him a

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.410 
maybe the judges would it gave him a
draw<00:00:40.270> or<00:00:40.739> maybe<00:00:41.739> even<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:42.070> victory<00:00:42.430> it<00:00:43.239> was<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
draw or maybe even the victory it was a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.710 
draw or maybe even the victory it was a
very<00:00:43.750> close<00:00:44.290> fight<00:00:44.530> him<00:00:44.739> verse<00:00:44.920> Adrian<00:00:45.720> he's
