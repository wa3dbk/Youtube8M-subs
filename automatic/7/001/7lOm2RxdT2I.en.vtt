00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.560
 supposed 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.080
 of the region decision is a region 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.230
 beautiful i 'm going to add so much juice 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 lemon and more olive oil but firm 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'm going to mix this 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.369
 let it fall apart 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 deeply we are going to add very salt 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.440
 all right 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.930
 today because I'm going to put the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 salt first and salt grain and I'm going to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.330
 start now to move as you go 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.160
 adding my oil to go 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:54.170
 dissolving exactly already learned 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.170
 we are just fine 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 and it's ready in the air it's super 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.149
 complicated to do which is 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.559
 complicated is because it is rich and simple 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.309
 exact but now if it comes the most 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.170
 fun i'm going to take out 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.610
 florets 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.159
 of cauliflower 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.219
 this 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.500
 you really know we're going to start in 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.770
 how rich to filetear 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.960
 sometimes we do it this way we go 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.960
 to put a bed of cauliflower 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.940
 I think it's a delicacy and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 we always give it cooked we have the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 liquids 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 in order and I'll tell you what 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.320
 is a radio the radio is one comes from the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.850
 family of cabbages this is a brick 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.130
 we can find it in any 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.690
 supermarket already in some market of 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 san angel or merco the collar carbÃ³ 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.750
 Polish east market find it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.700
 racing the taste is very bitter is a 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.860
 very Mediterranean flavor and the truth 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 I love I like the combination that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.390
 I'm going to do now because I'm going to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.550
 Put this cow down I'm not going to put 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.280
 a few habits of 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.470
 celery 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.920
 How about we will turn them pear plantita 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.920
 around 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:22.280
 I'm not using castilla tantito 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:26.069
 rich parsley chives of course 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 tati is lemon zest very well 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.840
 let's pick it up tantito to the best 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 lifting series and we're going to put some 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.360
 slices 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.640
 of psp 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.290
 I think it's a good idea 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.580
 because the penalty is very tasty has it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.310
 ready like this and now we are going to bathe the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.240
 porto alegre 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.750
 that is very complicated 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.530
 but that is very very rich that it cuts with 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.660
 this heat 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.220
 exactly not and it's worth it like it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.050
 the hangover and we're going to mix everything but I 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.210
 I prefer to have a plate than a plate 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.800
 of presentation and good I thought it was good 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.080
 idea to put all the ingredients together 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.180

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.520
