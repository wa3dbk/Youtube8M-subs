00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.290
 the 10 companies that control 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.290
 basically everything you consume 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.019
 we present you the big 10 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.760
 controlling corporations 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.430
 practically the entire market of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.750
 cosmetic foods and other products 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.750
 that we consume daily 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.270
 we live in a time when we are 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.680
 invites us to decide our identity 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.560
 from the products we choose 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.600
 consume what they ridiculously sell us 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.460
 as an existential exercise of the free 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.770
 agency within which we have the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 radiant autonomy to decide if we go 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.430
 to wash our hair with a product 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.989
 of l'orÃ©al or with one of pantene and if 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.090
 let's start our day feeding 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.350
 with some sugary sequels of 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.290
 nestle or common 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.850
 juanjo fish or even to choose if 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.970
 we will celebrate our decadence 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 gastronomic attending the heads and pizza 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.960
 hut the truth is that this virtual 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.820
 freedom is cut the colossal range of 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.730
 products that spill in the market 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.950
 only 10 big companies remember what 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.970
 earlier there are two phenomena 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.200
 particularly significant in the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.630
 construction of society 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.369
 contemporary on the one hand the fact of 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.649
 that the market or rather the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.149
 marketing has managed to penetrate the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.479
 most intimate degree of our existence 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.340
 the perception that most 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.710
 people whether conscious or 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.580
 unconsciously assume as principal 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 differentiator 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.600
 the group of objects of which 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.490
 surrounds and consequently the brands 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 that support these products 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.590
 indicates that at conception 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.759
 we will perceive our own identity 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.500
 we hardly associate them more after 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.290
 technique of our consumption habits 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.210
 the next phenomenon refers to this 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.220
 simulated freedom that the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.200
 large corporations a scenario 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.929
 full of wolves color palettes 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.330
 slogans and collective constructions in 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.670
 around the brands and if we analyze it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.950
 objectively not only are we not enjoying 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.750
 as a freedom outside a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 social identity beyond what 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 we consume is minimal but that neither 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.929
 It is not even that there is a diversity 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.240
 real then those small brands that 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.590
 they intended to offer something different they were 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.019
 already absorbed by the big 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 commercial conglomerates this one 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.310
 infographic that illustrates this note we 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.560
 suggests that I think that each caps echo 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.569
 awards 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.260
 johnson and johnson water and gamble 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.940
 Words Seniors Elders Own Dozens of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.460
 brands that permeate the everyday life of 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.680
 millions of people around the world 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.600
 curiously this same phenomenon the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.700
 hoarding virtually all 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 options within the market by 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.840
 monumental corporations replicates in 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.910
 other items, for example, the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.950
 media or in the case of 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.980
 banks a sector that in the past 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.780
 30 years has seen a reduction of 30% 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.240
 companies that control them after 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.520
 multiple mergers in which the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.190
 Larger corporate entities end 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.230
 for absorbing the little ones I hope 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.640
 that after analyzing this infographic the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.620
 next time you go to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.330
 supermarket do not give up before the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.310
 spectacular display of brands and 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 products that seek to consecrate themselves as a 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.150
 pseudo free but that above all 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 remember that your identity is not 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.440
 defined by virtual bifurcations 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.170
 who star in magny cross or coca-cola 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.730
 pepsi or colgate crest but this one goes 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.190
 configured by the way in which 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.300
 you receive processes and share information 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.060
 that results from your experiences 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.280
 personal author's games 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.280
