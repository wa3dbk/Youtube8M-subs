00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.869
 to the girls today I'm going to show you my 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.809
 beach bag the little things that I take 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:16.240
 for the beach and like almost all of us 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 we carry almost the same I teach you for 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 stay little by little like this 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 this little bag since I taught it 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.390
 when I brought it to me and the truth is that it is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.539
 super useful to me I love to take me 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 to the beach would make it super comfortable since 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.470
 the water bank can leave us 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.810
 here comes I take a big 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.540
 before sir this teaches two little things 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.480
 that we saw that you can not miss one in 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 the little hat this for example and of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.930
 arantxa from the private 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.930
 I carry this with the capitals 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.949
 I do not know I can never miss this because I 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.829
 It served quite as it protects me two 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.199
 before the sun and sometimes a few moments 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.590
 Tires us good from the sun protects us a 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 little bit we are removing the shade 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.460
 without having arrived 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 If you do not take me this hat because it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.380
 better I take a lot of space I take the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380
 tiny 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.670
 the facts are just tiny in 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.670
 the one who has a mask inside 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.260
 tabs are tarawa dry or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.470
 petropiar a site 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:42.430
 a face protector this solar of plus 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.320
 anti-aging sunscreen is 50 more already 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.660
 that does not use less protection of 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.380
 50 of Greece is not too strong me 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.380
 I really like it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.160
 it came to me 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.160
 visit 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.229
 and a little sevilla that in 3 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.320
 apart 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.610
 apart from the strong payne pot is the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.900
 protector know that I'm trying on 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.200
 new 50 more and I hope they are a vy 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.470
 against the grape rays the long ones so 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.650
 the skin is a little whitish but 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.190
 some home that we have a little bit more 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.760
 of the sun advisable a higher product 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 and more dense 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.959
 so I recommend you although I would not leave 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.959
 a little whitish 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.510
 to soften the sunscreen on this one 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.819
 plastic case is like plastic 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.460
 hard 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.740
 friends 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.280
 and in your interest speakers and 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.520
 announced the very high protection of 50 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.620
 more and Arabic activates our melamines as well 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.520
 than to get a tan without 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.570
 avoiding protection is ideal and it is not 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.340
 Also this past year so I 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.740
 beige and approve it and the products to the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.540
 time but a great clean spirits that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.670
 use high protection because 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.520
 normally these measurements from before 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.920
 from my little girl but the truth is that 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720
 the hair has got tangled very well and when 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.970
 we have hope wet the beach what 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.390
 first that will not be I went out to take a 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.490
 little bit and brush everything and so 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.040
 I keep a little untreated 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.220
 this from carrefour and is the brand 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.220
 Carrefour 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.290
 this bag to take them to the area 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.690
 inside the next stained towel ni 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.730
 nothing but on the return only the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.319
 wet bikini for those who got wet 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.040
 towel in my change because I can no longer 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.040
 be with delicious 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.800
 but this does not usually wear a bikini the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.220
 change stress to be able to change me 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.220
 on the beach 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.340
 since his arrival, a little box of sun 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.340
 teacher 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 what does not see us d'alacant to wake up 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.190
 in a towel I see this for example 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.950
 that my boy gave me is super soft and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.310
 it's pretty big and to talk in 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.500
 a truth that is super good 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 Those are all my things from the beach 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.060
 that usually takes me although almost always 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.400
 soil puts something also to peck 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.230
 to eat since the next hunger to 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.880
 part of our umbrella our chair 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.880
 so I hope that I have
