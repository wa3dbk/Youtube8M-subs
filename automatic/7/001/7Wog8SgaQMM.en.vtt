amazon com um but I'll try some of these
in<00:01:37.920> front<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.759> gauge<00:01:39.750> with

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
in front of you so you can gauge with

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.270 
in front of you so you can gauge with
your<00:01:40.140> life

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.740 

so<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.940> obviously<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.510> lot

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so they're going to be obviously a lot

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
so they're going to be obviously a lot
smaller<00:01:46.050> than<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.890> sunflower<00:01:47.520> seed<00:01:47.940> they

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
smaller than a sunflower seed they

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
smaller than a sunflower seed they
offers<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> same<00:01:48.690> amount<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.110> flavor<00:01:49.320> they're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
offers the same amount of flavor they're

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
offers the same amount of flavor they're
going<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:51.090> nutrients<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.960> fiber

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
going to have more nutrients more fiber

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.130 
going to have more nutrients more fiber
more<00:01:52.560> protein<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.640> magnesium<00:01:54.140> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
more protein and more magnesium and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.990 
more protein and more magnesium and
probably<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.830> lot<00:01:56.520> less<00:01:56.700> salt<00:01:57.260> so<00:01:58.260> with<00:01:58.680> this

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
probably a lot less salt so with this

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.480 
probably a lot less salt so with this
product<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> went<00:02:00.300> ahead<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.190> created<00:02:02.190> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
product I went ahead and created a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.420 
product I went ahead and created a
recipe<00:02:02.940> incorporating<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:05.100> once<00:02:05.280> again
