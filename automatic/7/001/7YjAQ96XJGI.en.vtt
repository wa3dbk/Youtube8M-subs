the one I use at home it's made of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
the one I use at home it's made of
plastic<00:00:50.390> plastic<00:00:53.630> that's<00:00:54.630> not<00:00:54.899> strong<00:00:55.170> enough

speed made of this is made of iron
all<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.870> implements<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.440> made<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.890> iron<00:01:05.570> come

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all our implements are made of iron come

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.200 
all our implements are made of iron come
I'll<00:01:07.530> tell<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> story<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> iron<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.970> was

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I'll tell you the story of iron it was

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.770 
I'll tell you the story of iron it was
nearly<00:01:12.690> 3,000<00:01:13.530> years<00:01:13.710> ago<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:15.150> people<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
nearly 3,000 years ago that people in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.160 
nearly 3,000 years ago that people in
this<00:01:16.170> part<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> world<00:01:17.420> began<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:18.720> iron

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this part of the world began using iron

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
this part of the world began using iron
to<00:01:19.950> make<00:01:20.190> implements<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:21.710> how<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.010> know

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to make implements and how do we know

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.590 
to make implements and how do we know
that<00:01:23.990> because<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.490> lot<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> iron<00:01:26.909> tools<00:01:27.270> have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that because a lot of iron tools have

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
that because a lot of iron tools have
been<00:01:27.810> found<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.520> megalithic<00:01:29.520> burials<00:01:30.020> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
been found in megalithic burials that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
been found in megalithic burials that
are<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.880> 3000<00:01:32.880> years<00:01:33.119> old<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> ever

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
are around 3000 years old I see so ever

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.390 
are around 3000 years old I see so ever
since<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.710> invoice<00:01:38.549> used<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.210> tools

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
since then I invoice used to make tools

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
since then I invoice used to make tools
scientists<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.640> found<00:01:41.850> lots<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.960> tools<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
scientists have found lots of tools that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
scientists have found lots of tools that
are<00:01:44.540> 2500<00:01:45.540> years<00:01:45.780> old<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.890> means<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:48.090> use

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
are 2500 years old which means that use

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.850 
are 2500 years old which means that use
of<00:01:48.720> iron<00:01:48.960> implements<00:01:49.680> increased<00:01:50.400> with<00:01:50.700> time

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
of iron implements increased with time

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.260 
of iron implements increased with time
what<00:01:52.520> all<00:01:52.880> did<00:01:53.150> they<00:01:53.330> use<00:01:53.600> iron<00:01:54.080> tools<00:01:54.380> for

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
what all did they use iron tools for

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.810 
what all did they use iron tools for
iron<00:01:56.270> axes<00:01:57.020> were<00:01:57.230> used<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.740> chop<00:01:58.160> wood<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
iron axes were used to chop wood and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.380 
iron axes were used to chop wood and
clear<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.810> forest<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:01.070> iron<00:02:01.610> plowshares

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
clear the forest and iron plowshares

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.230 
clear the forest and iron plowshares
helped<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.350> till<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.800> fields<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.340> increased

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
helped to till the fields and increased

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.680 
helped to till the fields and increased
production<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.050> our<00:02:06.830> first<00:02:07.300> time<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.509> get

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
production and our first time to get

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.400 
production and our first time to get
back<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.429> walk<00:02:10.700> around<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.120> fields<00:02:11.980> sure

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
important job mr. scarecrow yes

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.270 
important job mr. scarecrow yes
maybe<00:02:42.590> after<00:02:43.070> irrigation<00:02:43.910> yeah<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:45.080> think

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
maybe after irrigation yeah I think

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.680 
maybe after irrigation yeah I think
irrigating<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> crop<00:02:46.700> comes<00:02:47.030> first<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
irrigating the crop comes first and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.570 
irrigating the crop comes first and
scaring<00:02:48.530> curls<00:02:48.890> are<00:02:49.160> very<00:02:49.270> close<00:02:50.270> second

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
scaring curls are very close second

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.660 
scaring curls are very close second
irrigation<00:02:53.260> yes

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
irrigation yes

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.850 
irrigation yes

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
irrigation means watering the plants

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.699 
irrigation means watering the plants
different<00:02:58.489> ways<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.299> irrigation<00:02:59.780> have<00:03:00.470> been

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
different ways of irrigation have been

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.460 
different ways of irrigation have been
developed<00:03:01.220> by<00:03:01.519> farmers<00:03:01.820> since<00:03:02.630> very<00:03:03.080> early

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
developed by farmers since very early
