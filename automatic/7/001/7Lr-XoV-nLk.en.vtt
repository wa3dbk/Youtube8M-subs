00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:41.620
 Is the bridegroom better? Yes, a little less. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.450
 Oh, we would like her husband to live with her husband haneunge as to let the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.809
 good 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:54.579
 I met such a Buddha and do not think about it, but how do you think? 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 What we've met Buddhist temples bring 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 When we go to temples, we are mistaken for believing in Buddhism. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:09.040
 I have never believed in Buddhism. Think about it. In the future, our people believe in Buddhism. 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.980
 There is no one. 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:18.790
 I'm going to Buddhism. 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:24.710
 Why should I go Buddhism? What happened to this Buddhism from my knowledge ? 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:30.740
 The mass I meet around me has changed the environment. 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.760
 Since I know Buddhism, so I ride Buddhism, 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.960
 These environments are on me . 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.960
 To give this environment , God leads you to Buddhism 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:53.060
 This is why a ship carrying a Buddhist in order to give that to the surrounding environment 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.200
 On geotyiji it led to Buddhism's bullseye drag fishing Buddhism that believe in Buddhism 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.460
 It's not. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.460
 This Buddhism is a 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 The word Christian machangajigo 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:12.830
 Growth is the same, waves are the same. 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:17.120
 This is a way of putting in a way, but are you insisting on the means? 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.590
 This will make things difficult. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.680
 Which one, then, because we got double in this Buddhism 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.830
 There are many relationships around the environment that are given and I do not listen to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.200
 This knowledge of many masses also changes 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:40.330
 Now that this study and absorb these things and these meet my fate 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 I can make friends again and I have an environment to give to various states. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.680
 We fell into Buddhism. 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:55.379
 So the gift of God you can not find anything, 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.739
 Here the environment makes you good, but Buddhism makes you good 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.739
 Not. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.950
 When I looked for Buddha law and saw the boat, 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.980
 Did not it happen? 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:16.740
 If you can not use this well, you can not escape the difficulty. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:21.000
 What if you go to Christianity and go to Buddhism? 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:26.650
 If you know this principle, wherever you go 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.049
 Do not fall, do not fall, even in Christian Buddhist Do not fall even once Taoism 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.560
 I do not fall into the fire, but I wake up around it 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.880
 Do it and absorb it. 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.880
 We do not have difficulties in doing this . 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.989
 Now I have a hard time trying to reduce loosen caught days 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.600
 You do not know this outside and see the environment around you. 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:54.850
 You do not see the bush. 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:00.160
 So we are not able to solve the difficulties. 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:07.510
 Oh, from now on, 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:12.580
 Where are tied rather nice environment around the organization went in to the environment 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:17.200
 It's like how much you absorb this environment and I will live brightly . 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.490
 Here've placed the center of the La malyijyo So the husband 2 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:26.560
 If we keep our cathedral, we'll go to the cathedral. 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:30.940
 But Jesus Christ saved me on that side. God will save me. 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:37.810
 Do not think of giving , but God leads to work . 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:42.760
 This is what you can do according to your suit. 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:49.360
 I'm going to religion now and I'm not going to live . 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:52.240
 If you live well, bring it to you well and you should write well. 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.310
 It's disappearing. 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 Buddha can not give rice cake. 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:04.220
 It is possible to come here in the Buddha's name 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:09.170
 You gave it to me around the waist again . I have to eat it. 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.010
 This did not eat aboard negative drag anmeokgo requirements ghosts hanging naked please 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:16.270
 If you do not eat it, you will starve. 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.270
 Buddha and all starved Kiri 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:27.710
 We cut the bad rate and we played the game until this time. 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:33.650
 Geotinde gave the gift it asked the police absorb the environment around them to see 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:37.100
 I can not do this and I can not absorb it now, so I 'm living harder now. 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.390
 The two years how important a person who deungeo around 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.880
 I can take these things seriously and make the exchange like this right 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:49.400
 I've done this sort of thing throw line 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:55.910
 I've been studying novels like this for a while now , 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:06:00.940
 So what we have in the house is that we have this society. 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.940
 Well, I can be free. 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.250
 If our husband in this house wants to do this like this, 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:13.539
 It is wisdom. 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.479
 Yes, I'll follow that now and that's where Buddha goes. 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:19.980
 I ganikka severe depending enemy and will punish me 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:23.430
 You must hold the branches of Buddha and take them apart . 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:29.250
 Uh deunya that kind generosity also not crab paste 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:32.520
 It's going to be like that. 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:37.230
 It's also what empowers your husband's heart. 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:42.060
 If I have too much I gotta have ties deeds of the Buddha learned here 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:46.530
 Do not you have to open your mind so that it can be delivered to your husband? 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.950
 Is not that what it means to be a Buddha ? 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.950
 Is that 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 Ahhh
