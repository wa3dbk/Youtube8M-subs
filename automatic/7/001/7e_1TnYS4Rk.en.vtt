00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390

mirror<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.959> it's<00:02:57.349> terrible<00:02:57.950> but<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.920> idea<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
mirror and it's terrible but the idea is

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:11.410 
mirror and it's terrible but the idea is
to<00:03:01.910> not<00:03:03.099> follow<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.220> pattern<00:03:04.599> pattern<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:10.420> try

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
to not follow a pattern pattern and try

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.479 
to not follow a pattern pattern and try
to<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.840> them<00:03:12.019> disappear<00:03:12.260> as<00:03:12.859> much<00:03:13.159> as<00:03:13.340> you

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
to make them disappear as much as you

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.250 
to make them disappear as much as you
can<00:03:17.079> okay

can okay

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.110 
can okay
we<00:03:18.590> don't<00:03:18.769> want<00:03:18.920> them<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.370> too<00:03:19.790> dark

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
because otherwise it will look like

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.750
