 hi guys today's video is dedicated to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 in fact, our animal friends talk about 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.730
 games and toys for our friends 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.740
 animals are in a special place for 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.540
 to do that I thank immediately it is the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.679
 udine mickey mouse shop 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 mickey mouse is a chain of stores 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.570
 in the region where I am then more 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 different giulia dedicated so it has everything 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 what is necessary to power 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.019
 accessories for anything else 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.019
 animals also present in gemona pile 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.730
 and codroipo and even more as a boutique 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 dedicated to clothing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 accessories for animals in udine like 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 sympathetic is called spetta corte but 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 let's go immediately to see the games and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
 educational toys to grow 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.510
 together with our house puppies 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 along with filippo from the mickey staff 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 mouse from filippo hello 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.239
 so here we are with those who are 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 of very particular games that not 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 I never saw that I saw when 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.070
 entering he makes mickey mouse and I didn't think 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 there were also for our friends 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 animals state of index games 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.730
 reactivates mental activations exactly 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.989
 ok so practically how it works 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.030
 maybe it creates one let's see also 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 our friends but we have four here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 possibilities that allow us thanks to the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 food that we hide inside 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 each of these containers to attract 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.850
 the attention of our dog two ideas e 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 thanks to the museum the legs succeed in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 some way to solve these 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.750
 let's call them puzzles to have 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 access to food for example the first yes 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 constitutes of a small panel from 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.829
 move to make the croquette 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.189
 fall down and roll over to reach the dog 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.090
 here it is, the second is made up of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.619
 two possibilities the first is a small drawer 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.460
 that the dog is thanks to this spaghetti 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 beautiful of direct is little indeed 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.549
 open to have access to food then there is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 there is a small piston there 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.720
 it allows it to be pushed, perhaps from the nose 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.549
 of the dog to drop off the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 croquette then we have these other two 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.350
 then this on my right there 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.990
 allows thanks to reports of this 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.549
 do piston to let out the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 croquette while this is another 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.429
 drawer with a small lever then more 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.290
 difficult that needs to be moved 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.609
 to free up the space within which 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
 we have hidden but therefore 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.959
 filippo but this is a game like open 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090
 pack the dog you can play right away 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.650
 or it takes a moment like us 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.109
 when we say we read the instructions of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 a game how we can help 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.989
 precisely this game has the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.180
 instructions but they are not for the dog they are 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.620
 for the master it is a real the dog does not have 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.359
 absolutely need at least 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.819
 at the beginning of our assistance for 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.739
 to understand how this game works 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.049
 also because this helps us to 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.709
 develop a relationship of trust between 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.060
 us and our four-legged friend 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.769
 then noted on the packaging of these 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.340
 games of the atrix and that there are different 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.079
 levels 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.329
 that's what i then correspond to 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.220
 levels distinguish the difficulty that the 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.889
 dog will meet in being able to solve 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.780
 these these games therefore for example 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.450
 what we have below is a game 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.700
 level 2 level 2 a difficulty 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.280
 intermediate that combines several together 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.500
 solutions in order to allow the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 kanadi develop different paths 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.810
 mental to be able to then have access to 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.150
 food 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.769
 this instead filippo is the gorilla 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.260
 right has been tested I see said 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.209
 to the technical packaging but what 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.099
 consists of this game which is a lot 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.109
 rubbery but also very resistant is 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.269
 exactly this is a rubbery game e 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.669
 very durable that aims to 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.409
 hide us in croquettes in 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.810
 so as to attract thanks to 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 scent of food or perfume 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.109
 of food 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.290
 the dog or the dog will recognize it 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.000
 like his toy and will try to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.530
 being able to take to procuring oneself 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.319
 croquettes that we would have hidden 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.180
 inside maybe keeping them still preventing them 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.470
 that come out too easily thanks to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.549
 example to a pasta as can be 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.509
 this to a make-up in short 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.919
 Somehow one that we can 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.290
 leave it so free 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.659
 ok so even so it's just that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.189
 excess meter came out so maybe it 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.349
 learn to play with it instead want 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.569
 our slippers as correct rather 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.280
 that with a slipper a shoe of 50 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.129
 euro we have this that in short it costs 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.900
 less and serves better purpose 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.569
 I always wondered filippo as I see 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.400
 in our dog friends I would say that they see 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.140
 a little green a little yellowish like 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.430
 this game works then this is a 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.699
 particular game that was made 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.680
 just to meet the way of 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.550
 see that they have our dogs ie 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.050
 who see it two colors 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.449
 basically that i am indigo and 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.759
 yellow consequently this game is 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.380
 was made with these two colors 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.910
 so that it can jump 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.770
 to the eye of our dog more 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.660
 easily compared to other things 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.440
 this is also the characteristic beyond the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.849
 nice rattle inside 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.099
 float in the water so you can 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.440
 play with your truck and even at the 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.509
 river or lake by the sea 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.970
 ok so suitable for all dogs for 26 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.550
 years of course depending on the size a 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.590
 ok ok so let's say with this 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.580
 dimension 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.110
 when a dog from 10 to 15 kg to 25 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.729
 surely you will find a lot 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.860
 satisfaction a bigger dog if it is 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.820
 swallows is a smaller dog can 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.470
 take it for the explosive and we end up with 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.539
 motion games allow own 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.949
 our animal friends on the move 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.320
 then in this case the classic game 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.789
 throws the ball but the beauty that that 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.710
 which we use to launch a principal in 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.440
 giant hand also a little flexible though 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.000
 you see exact catapult is hard like 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.530
 come with staying together the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.090
 shop to introduce the final has 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.550
 so of course I liked this one 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.229
 classic point game of exactly 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.690
 this is a game that allows us 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.320
 instead of throwing our ball with 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.120
 the hands of being able to get a launch more 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.039
 effective and above all to be able to vent 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.840
 our barbaric sites by playing 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.400
 together with our dear and therefore is a 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.320
 game that is good for him because he moves 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.150
 to us because we can download a little 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.610
 of stress in the company of our dog 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.220
 ok i'll thank you filippo but not there 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.430
 try to see in the second episode 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.840
 which immediately gave him our own 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.840
 cats clothes thanks a lot 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.460
 ok
