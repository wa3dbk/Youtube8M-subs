 Hello! Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions. 

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.520
 Today I will draw a realistic mouth. 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.740
 I start with the outline of the upper lip 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.449
 and then on the lower one. 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 I paint lightly, pencil HB, so I can make corrections if needed. 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.410
 The upper lip is usually a little thinner than the lower lip. 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.910
 I begin to give the texture a little or very much following the shape of the lips. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 To work on the shadows, I change the pencil to 3B. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.890
 I darken them to stand out. 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.739
 Remember that the upper lip will be more in the shade, 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.619
 while the lower one will catch more light and reflection. 

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:11.619
 Use a brush to soften the lines and give a tone to the drawing. 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.270
 and tire to add the lights. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 The upper lip has 3 muscles: 1 in the middle and 2 at the ends. 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.039
 And the bottom has only 2, divided into the middle. 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.279
 Even if they are hard to see, you will draw better, 

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.770
 if you understand from anatomy. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.770
 I like them! These lips begin to become really sexy! 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.049
 I give them more texture, details and darkness, 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.569
 in order for the lights to look brighter because of the contrast. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.849
 I keep repeating what I have already painted and attributed to him 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.579
 more volume through lights and shadows. 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.849
 When I put the reflections I usually soften them 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.579
 with a brush. 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.150
 I want the upper lip to become a bit darker. 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.150
 And I add reflected light to the lower part of the lower lip. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.150
 OK! Is ready! 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.550
