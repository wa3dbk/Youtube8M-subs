00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.170
 The class here on the cable on youtube 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.600
 for remake fantasy 7 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 then the last month if I am not mistaken the 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.760
 sale only on the site of the school he 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.490
 it's bad to 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.500
 different from what has changed in this 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 environment here compared to the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.090
 old has changed some things for example 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.040
 which is most glaring as soon as you 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.510
 realize the colors of the game are more 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.580
 alive 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.710
 besides, if I see here the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.300
 the text and such 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.190
 it is well delimited to it never again 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.989
 that grid that had the version 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:01.690
 before it was improved 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:05.530
 but the will is there to see the course of the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.190
 game play and how do you have some animation for 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.340
 example the scene that what they can a 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.950
 wall or exploding generator scene 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.850
 or the train scene 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.600
 these animations 6 20 have a cut read 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.420
 nothing suddenly cuts from the perfect image 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
 in which the question now comes from a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.360
 image that it is perceived that the old 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.710
 be the animations they were not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 modified to appear graphics 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.040
 current are not the most animated leagues 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.500
 well coarse well squared 6 people 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.110
 it does not have much to do with what they gave 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.470
 to change here in his own gameplay 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.300
 it was not very nice so good 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.700
 I get the animation that I played this 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.490
 part of nasdaq on top so I know 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.790
 to say it 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 another thing portuguese translation is the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.780
 beta translation 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.690
 Let me see that the name of whoever did it was 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 I have to read blogspot.com 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.860
 this translation of 2008 she beta 02 01 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.319
 06 02 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 she is not ready she does not translate everything 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.629
 six are looking at some fruits for 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.080
 example above does not appear 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.060
 attack looks like attack 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.230
 some things will only translate now that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.900
 I found it extremely rough in this transition 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.090
 is that at various times when you have to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.930
 appears a text appears before a text 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.959
 written full person portal translation 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.440
 so utterly useless propaganda is 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.609
 once, but this is 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.329
 repeat several times throughout the game 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.319
 You do not like me very much so I said 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.530
 graphics 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.560
 said translation speak joystick 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.480
 it already comes ready configured 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.609
 keys to play on the keyboards and do not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920
 mistake x is what will move the 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:11.859
 character 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.980
 everything there in the corner ow lar sd 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.319
 x1 is the edno that this Sunday in your 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.540
 use as humans want mole one close 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.540
 the other can use the numeric keypad 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.900
 finally not landing with ducks and right 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.500
 I'm using xbox 360 joystick 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.840
 had great thing to great balcony he 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.470
 already set up by xbox child rech 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.110
 That is said game arrived from mexico is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.200
 playing does not have much secrecy 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.049
 thing is watching here a fight thing 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.640
 here responsories had no 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.739
 difficulty to release the koubo or to 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.650
 to defend myself that I have not been able to 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.420
 no time to defend is once or 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.019
 another who managed to drop a mallet 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.940
 none the stronger attack 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.940
 I do not know why I can not 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:14.930
 Take the time only then let's see maybe 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:20.150
 the mittal failure finally leaving in June 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.849
 2007 with graphics ii that give a changed 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.220
 but the animations continued animations 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:29.289
 rough did not change the missing animations 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.210
 I did not play in 2007 when 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.050
 modernized for 2002 for animations of 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.050
 2007 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.039
 There is not much else to talk about, it's not just 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.039
 That's it folks 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.290
 tries to realize buying about 9 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.140
 20 reais, right? 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:05:00.930
 channel 99 but the dollar but better than 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:03.300
 about $ 4 found and played only ray that 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.000
 music is this face and that motto 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.010
 mini keyboard tite 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.680
 in the end what the hell is that old that I 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.150
 I found it bad to have had classical music. 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.350
 for this crap 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:26.370
 anyway this is not even signed up 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:30.740
 on cable access channel just spoke to 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.740
