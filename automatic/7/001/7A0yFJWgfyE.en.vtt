this<00:01:22.069> side<00:01:22.310> all<00:01:23.119> right<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.020> they<00:01:24.170> don't

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
this side all right then they don't

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.660 
this side all right then they don't
realize<00:01:24.709> that<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:25.009> looks<00:01:25.159> kind<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.399> dumb

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
realize that it looks kind of dumb

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.209

because<00:01:26.479> we're<00:01:26.659> going<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.869> do<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.950> copies

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
because we're going to do it it copies

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.520 
because we're going to do it it copies
it<00:01:28.459> and<00:01:28.759> puts<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:29.420> like<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.469> other

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
it and puts it like this on the other

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.499 
it and puts it like this on the other
side<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:31.640> see<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:31.880> goes<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
side so you see it goes like this to

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.080 
side so you see it goes like this to
this<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.069> it<00:01:34.280> gets<00:01:34.459> the<00:01:34.640> mirror<00:01:34.850> image

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
this so that it gets the mirror image

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.190 
this so that it gets the mirror image
which<00:01:36.340> instead<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.459> being<00:01:37.849> like<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.209> the<00:01:38.929> t

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
which instead of being like this the t

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.639 
which instead of being like this the t
ub<00:01:39.979> be<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:40.819> this<00:01:40.909> side<00:01:41.090> it'll<00:01:41.239> be<00:01:41.390> reversed<00:01:41.750> you

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
ub be on this side it'll be reversed you

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.029 
ub be on this side it'll be reversed you
have<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:43.840> for<00:01:44.840> words<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.319> sponsors<00:01:45.920> like

that they have to each be done by

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.710 
that they have to each be done by
themselves<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:48.470> each<00:01:48.920> separate<00:01:49.340> side<00:01:49.720> now

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
themselves on each separate side now

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.679 
themselves on each separate side now
let's<00:01:50.959> say<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.280> we're<00:01:53.239> designed<00:01:53.539> this

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
let's say like this we're designed this

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.889 
let's say like this we're designed this
is<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.369> all<00:01:55.489> be<00:01:55.520> copied<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.450> pasted

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
is this can all be copied and pasted

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.559 
is this can all be copied and pasted
because<00:01:57.799> it's<00:01:58.009> not<00:01:58.189> words<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.030> stuff<00:01:59.179> but<00:01:59.420> the

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
because it's not words and stuff but the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.020 
because it's not words and stuff but the
16<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.920> would<00:02:01.130> be<00:02:01.219> considered<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> word

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
16 that would be considered like a word

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.719 
16 that would be considered like a word
they'll<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.509> be<00:02:02.750> done<00:02:03.530> original<00:02:04.429> on<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
they'll have to be done original on the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.130 
they'll have to be done original on the
other<00:02:04.849> side<00:02:05.259> okay<00:02:06.489> um<00:02:07.509> let's<00:02:08.509> get<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.019> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
other side okay um let's get to the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.710 
other side okay um let's get to the
dimensions<00:02:10.239> let's<00:02:11.239> go<00:02:11.359> performance<00:02:11.840> first

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.450

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
say what acceleration speed all the way

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
say what acceleration speed all the way
up<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.840> then<00:02:38.930> handing<00:02:39.380> off<00:02:39.530> me<00:02:39.709> down<00:02:40.090> having

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.990 
learning how to drift and I'm saying I'm
a<00:04:06.290> lot<00:04:06.470> its<00:04:06.620> kind<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.800> weird<00:04:08.050> go<00:04:09.050> again

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
a lot its kind of weird go again

let's<00:04:11.420> see<00:04:11.660> like<00:04:12.110> I<00:04:12.230> said<00:04:12.290> no<00:04:12.560> white<00:04:12.770> body

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
let's see like I said no white body

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.800 
let's see like I said no white body
looks<00:04:14.030> really<00:04:14.660> really<00:04:14.930> dumb

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.970 

don't<00:04:19.799> use<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.870> now<00:04:21.870> dimensions<00:04:22.440> another<00:04:22.770> big

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
don't use it now dimensions another big

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.470 
don't use it now dimensions another big

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
dimensions believe it or not I think

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.430 
dimensions believe it or not I think
makes<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.210> huge<00:04:28.390> difference<00:04:28.750> when<00:04:29.170> you're
