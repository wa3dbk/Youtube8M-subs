points<00:00:37.519> in<00:00:37.610> midair<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.120> do<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.080> we've<00:00:39.320> mapped

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
points in midair to do so we've mapped

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.799 
points in midair to do so we've mapped
both<00:00:39.860> arms<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:40.610> left<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.030> right<00:00:41.420> triggers

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
both arms to the left and right triggers

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.320 
both arms to the left and right triggers
respectively<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.550> idea<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:43.879> simple<00:00:44.180> if

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
respectively so the idea is simple if

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.360 
respectively so the idea is simple if
there's<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.659> building<00:00:45.019> to<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.229> left<00:00:45.260> well<00:00:46.220> then

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
there's a building to the left well then

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.680 
there's a building to the left well then
it's<00:00:46.519> better<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.879> use<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.089> left<00:00:47.299> trigger<00:00:47.420> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's better to use the left trigger and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.329 
it's better to use the left trigger and
if<00:00:47.960> there's<00:00:48.140> one<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.409> the<00:00:48.500> right<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.159> it's

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
if there's one to the right then it's

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.100 
if there's one to the right then it's
better<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.670> use<00:00:49.729> a<00:00:49.820> retro<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.510> if<00:00:50.809> there's<00:00:50.960> no

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
better to use a retro and if there's no

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.689 
better to use a retro and if there's no
building<00:00:51.409> around<00:00:51.680> or<00:00:51.830> nothing<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.220> attach<00:00:52.489> to

2<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.640> way<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:43.000> approach<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.450> missions

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
2 is the way we approach to missions

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.589 
2 is the way we approach to missions
rather<00:02:45.459> than<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:45.790> through<00:02:45.819> linear<00:02:46.390> levels

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
rather than go through linear levels

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.390 
rather than go through linear levels
like<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.140> did<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> previous<00:02:47.650> games<00:02:48.010> this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
like we did in the previous games this

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.220 
like we did in the previous games this
time<00:02:48.459> around<00:02:48.819> we<00:02:49.030> created<00:02:49.420> open<00:02:49.569> areas<00:02:50.049> for

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
time around we created open areas for

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.350 
time around we created open areas for
you<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.410> explore<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:51.670> up<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.090> decide

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
you to explore it's up to you to decide

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.199 
you to explore it's up to you to decide
how<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.599> level<00:02:52.959> will<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.110> approached<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:54.209> this

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
how the level will be approached in this

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.000 
how the level will be approached in this
case<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.780> objective<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.410> infiltrate<00:02:56.739> the
