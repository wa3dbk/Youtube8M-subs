00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.680
 a bad placement 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.780
 What I hoped was the answer 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.870
 the bayern 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.349
 and I wanted to quote a biblical passage 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.559
 the soft compound failed 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.979
 if you put a point of view 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.399
 the Sunni majority 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.589
 contrary to the reverend as the body 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.960
 with the passage of time to enter spectator if they were begged and that many times 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.400
 only has the bible 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.710
 in the mountains 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the fourth chapter 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 physical 23 falls 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.160
 the time comes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.640
 john chapter 4 verse 23 but when it is time to send him now 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.050
 in which the true worshipers worshiped the Father in spirit and in truth 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.489
 Because the father is looking for talents. 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.660
 yes, yes, love it 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.510
 interpretation of his famous past 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.890
 But how are you? 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.360
 this past is a so-called touchstone 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.130
 in relation to the calculation, however, the inflamed discourse 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.670
 he was killed 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 which encompasses all this situation we are in that night 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 here to discuss any business as done 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 the confessions of the ecclesiastical documents of the end 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.760
 not only here 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.640
 the mistake 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.660
 have diverged at this point perhaps from the sea 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 the most historical view 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.120
 exactly because of the fact 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.160
 of this freedom 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.650
 it is from Pentecostalism this manifestation 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.300
 mauritius quintela 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.540
 It's mari be more open 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.790
 the places of nato 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.920
 this message is the case here in Brazil we have Nordic countries 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.160
 Scandinavian Europeans 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.410
 that keeps 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.560
 gilmar bandeira said and even so 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 read the scotland also corrected in the area 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.370
 however the question of Presbyterianism 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.250
 and there is no comparison 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.390
 with this aspect is another aspect 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.190
 we know that a win by a running group 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.700
 to abduct him because in my view we have a very strong aspect here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.919
 of countries where this message 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.239
 so the challenge of this aspect here in Brazil 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.720
 pardon 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.939
 has given so much freedom that the port has provided 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.209
 is that there would not be excessive stiffness 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.540
 with respect to the manifestations then 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.099
 the text of joão 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.069
 for me 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.509
 Why is it so wide? 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.539
 is right in the middle of all this discussion that we live 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.079
 in the first half of the program 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.069
 said asked if the reverend acted following jesus is not good 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.479
 talking about a 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.399
 of a new era 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.669
 was arriving in which players 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.569
 It is now past God no more 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.799
 the minister mayor and governor 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.129
 besides moses on the line about marriage but 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.999
 there really felt good put 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.490
 exactly this expedition 24 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.619
 There are 4 20 14 days left 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.979
 he used two rather interesting Greek words with a beautiful one of them 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.369
 galeteria for truth 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.319
 and another appears once the patient we 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.109
 In Portuguese, it's true. 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.579
 but alêtheia in Greek is opposed to false 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.929
 and aliens and the opposition art 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.059
 ah 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.339
 insured 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.939
 so he changed an idea of ​​the test to show that a time has come 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.029
 and that we will no longer need lovely so symbolic figure 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.399
 but in a real way because Christ is the body 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:38.739
 of the shadow why there was in the Old Testament then in the Old Testament 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.870
 The whole worship was very symbolic. 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.400
 sacred sacred furniture josé i in every part of the time in the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.039
 championship 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:55.579
 the visible sensory aspect was very present and to the question of the woman three 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.039
 attackers that our parents loved in this monti but you say that in 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.059
 jerusalem where to worship 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.109
 and then Jesus had the aspect of a work as the duration of the work is 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.669
 symbolically the repolitical as it was 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.039
 and he says it has reached the level of my worshipers the brandão in spirit and in 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.170
 Truth means 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.260
 in spirit and no longer in the symbolic way as it was formerly 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.709
 but now in a mode 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.930
 devoid of deivid symbols and sensory elements 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.820
 and this gives us a basis for saying then that the duration of the old will 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.430
 is different from the duration of the new testament the soliloquy of the government of the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.729
 state in slow motion but does not expect to look bad from the point of view 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.569
 I would say yes that's it. 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.460
 The Old Testament worked much more by sense center in the new 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.469
 testament works - with the senses 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.430
 and more points 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.559
 the spiritual guide of devotion 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.940
 because I've been noticing that the discussion started 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 there is not much interesting to start with 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.870
 for the two points of view and that it pays to discuss 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.000
 because as I said what said the elderly to what is most important to 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.279
 repetition does not allow identification 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.009
 plot to take a wine for housing placed 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.680
 make up your own opinion 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.569
 a commitment to fight for this to anatel henrique 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.569
 and for the day of Sao Paulo called night 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.320
 anyone who wanted 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.319
 little by little you have concluded 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.529
 after the loss of inter in the cup 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.529
 belem cider 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.330
 in beijing 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.379
 I work on a pilgrimage. 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.499
 the portal that do accounts 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.659
 since Monday 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.879
 the leader as a journalist works in the old fleet 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.189
 many things that happened behind you for four 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.199
 unfortunately 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.430
 I buy a body 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.849
 only now 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.839
 I've lost a lot of games 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.650
 being removed from there why 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.860
 things that have no profile praise and worship 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.210
 this intention to return to speak 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.400
 secretary 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.759
 the period 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.740
 without fundament 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.830
 the patent is really she was to replicate with 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.010
 and equality 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.080
 the person 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 itamar 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.080
 otherwise a bit different unfortunately as 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.250
 r20 parrot for the team to have jumped from 49º 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.690
 the parliamentarian spoke very soon 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.539
 restless in Brazil 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.949
 and something else that does not belong to toyota on strike I think when 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.319
 happens 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.529
 the secretary got the agreement 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:46.960
 all that the agreement with the church 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.819
 in the superbike that gave birth to his opinion 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:56.059
 and I'm going to take advantage of your 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:59.999
 this is just the 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.169
 relaxation 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:02.999
 had some 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:04.349
 we practice 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:08.720
 evangelicals, especially with young people, perhaps a strategy I did not feel 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:09.070
 so good 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.279
 the consumer has 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.310
 to bring 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.860
 yes this audience for rights 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.149
 but ended up public 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:18.149
 at risk of deuterium 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:20.710
 What is expected of her? 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.560
 I need to remember right to strike from the opposite a room until the expected
