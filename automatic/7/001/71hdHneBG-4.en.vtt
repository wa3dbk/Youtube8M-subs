does does asparagus fries value Oh

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.389 
does does asparagus fries value Oh
probably<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.790> i<00:01:54.149> mentioned<00:01:54.540> goes<00:01:54.659> mushy<00:01:54.960> so

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
probably not i mentioned goes mushy so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
probably not i mentioned goes mushy so
by<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> logic<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:57.270> catch<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.689> ice<00:01:57.810> spell

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170

was<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.079> supposed<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> work<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:06.229> get

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
was I supposed to work that out I get

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
was I supposed to work that out I get
that<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> certain<00:02:07.890> logic<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.720> freezing

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that there's a certain logic to freezing

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.020 
that there's a certain logic to freezing
the<00:02:10.050> Demon<00:02:10.410> Lord<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.400> immobilized

that<00:02:42.639> that<00:02:42.700> stupid<00:02:43.389> adventure<00:02:43.959> wasn't<00:02:44.230> just

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
that that stupid adventure wasn't just

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.420 
that that stupid adventure wasn't just
setting<00:02:45.159> me<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.639> fall<00:02:45.939> and<00:02:47.430> although

this<00:02:48.579> is<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.120> getting<00:02:49.269> into<00:02:49.599> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
this is kind of not getting into the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
this is kind of not getting into the
spirit<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.169> game<00:02:50.439> that<00:02:51.189> block<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.849> ice

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
looks to me like it's the bottom half of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.220 
looks to me like it's the bottom half of
a<00:02:54.340> big<00:02:54.519> circle<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:55.090> ice<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.720> I'm<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.049> try
