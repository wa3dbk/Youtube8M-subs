00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.910
 The years of experience that the so early hour there is one more 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.910
 if they are the ears 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.440
 and 20 just here for the application my march 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.369
 she is just up 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.350
 To celebrate Lottes Ryanair had second smoke 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.039
 Place up to 2 of the most stock live and scarves 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.099
 and what else it would be necessary and so was actually on 25 in June 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.439
 The Epcos has to be a novelty but is still free 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.990
 and we just take a look until the Danube can be worth it 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.220
 you 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.550
 Sure then, the storage capacity was percent for 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.640
 is appropriate 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.900
 yes this is very strong 4 Montreal does not have many options to start from another 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.240
 or look at a short tutorial, but what percent 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.340
 Actually not just on how about the game is a self-explanatory around 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.560
 the Regener MordplÃ¤nen play II 7 because we know already quite difficult 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.330
 are there still moms about different birds? 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.430
 To unlock we can fly with just times the one with this 2 0 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.060
 which he has already unlocked and so the BSI not relatively easy 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.070
 Being there on the right side of the screen will help you understand that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.180
 you can fly the bird on the left you have it 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 via Twitter said when you get 3 of this clutter you should be one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 Cleansing must be collected means other special attack what that is exactly 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 Of course, it's not all about it and all of that even though I'm not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.090
 used 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.760
 and that at the moment it's just not music at all and is something 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.730
 boring from the beginning 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.310
 Dulig Percent located a simple slide and he wants to see you if you can 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.140
 he lets go and then when he gets back on it he flies 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.610
 more you could already at Ahlen the percent 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 maybe the victory of it in evil 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 Asia was inspired 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 and as you can see percent 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.179
 after his foul one looks for a few feathers if you want more 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.080
 seeker 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.860
 such a stone 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.320
 goes flying over and if you fly a thing it's game over and then 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.070
 had to start again 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.370
 we're just trying another new exam as the meeting 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.249
 come 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.719
 and percent now see more Jepsen just help in the next try 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.079
 here our 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.339
 collected must be a lot number 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:23.179
 and 4 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.929
 what is her way had brought good question 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.639
 in this picture bigger become lonelier but otherwise I have now 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.839
 no big change seen 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.949
 special case again, one or, let's say, try 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.629
 because it is not that easy in the first one 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.729
 after beginnings 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.219
 What has tried a lot we would not only for Fernanda's first wall 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.319
 got stuck 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.769
 that means just in the beginning you have to play a little 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 by the way, if you also Romand's roof with 10 2 percent 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.779
 come to the edge of the iPhone screen first the game was also demo 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 of course, if you're getting a percent too strong on it 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 "Why look missing here once 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:08.259
 the special shortened it could always be used 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.729
 No, okay 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.979
 affected was only normal 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.059
 Driver's license does not have to be something like that anyway what should one do because 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.529
 not exactly 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.919
 the game is 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 we use ours for the first time 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.529
 and next to the chauffeur 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.879
 Shopping for a little money 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.879
 for example this little the Exer 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.579
 Nuts if I go now 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 The goal is in English and German is because I'm not now 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.659
 you could this one must miss 15 12 clock or even here penultimate 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.329
 Unlock bird or directly to all good mood to play 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.229
 have to 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.299
 but it does not make sense of the thing that's why you probably should not do that 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.680
 summarizing shock 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 Being something on the sidelines I personally become his percent 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.839
 probably right if he's gay 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.409
 not just lost because it's boring for me is the gameplay of 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.799
 our 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.140
 This makes it quite difficult for the bird to control it 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.929
 So I'd like to try and percent 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.739
 communicate our opinion every game finds graphic percent Regina 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.249
 optimized 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:18.349
 and yes 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.360
 if you think just post in the comments and thanks for them
