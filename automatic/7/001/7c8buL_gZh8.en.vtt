00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 another thing that draws a lot of attention 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.240
 also the design of the hood 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.640

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.640

 the steering wheel a little turned up is a 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 characteristic of him too

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.909
 was exchanged for this semblant of 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.209

 brand research 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.810
 one of the coolest things about the puma 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.050
 the fact that he was called in 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.520

 tested the car 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.150
