00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.190
 A) Yes 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.490
 Malaga that is what they were abandoning 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.809
 how 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.540
 it can not be better to be in the middle 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.540
 images image on a shore 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.489
 in more media 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.489
 we have 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 there are times that it also ended in a 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.539
 and now another car is coming 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 but at the moment of truth 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.360
 they are emptying these 2 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 what happened into account 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 it 's going down but it's bad we're going 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.760
 4 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.350
 really 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.350
 the complication 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.010
 the new ones 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.050
 good 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.030
 they were here with the horses 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.220
 like last year and it 's red there 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.960
 goes 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.650
 well down there and there they are giving 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.650
 turns to the bull 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:59.220
 and from there come the owners and ovens 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.920
 I believe that there is a big industry 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.150
 true 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.230
 It is the best 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.209
 why 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:45.030
 but good 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.750
 we talk with every day but we 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.750
 we go 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.260
 stable 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.900
 of course 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.870
