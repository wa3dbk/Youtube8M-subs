00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
place a situation etc in this case I was

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.660 
place a situation etc in this case I was
thinking<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:21.000> faith<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.399> what

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
thinking about faith and this is what

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
thinking about faith and this is what
came<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> listened<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.399> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
came out and so I listened to it and I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
came out and so I listened to it and I
followed<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:27.509> followed<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
followed it down followed the that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
followed it down followed the that
little<00:01:29.190> initial<00:01:29.759> musical<00:01:30.180> idea<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.470> its

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
little initial musical idea down to its

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.820 
little initial musical idea down to its
logical<00:01:31.950> conclusion<00:01:33.289> at<00:01:34.289> least<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.530> thought<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
logical conclusion at least I thought it

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.919 
logical conclusion at least I thought it
was<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> logical<00:01:35.430> conclusion<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.840> know

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
was a logical conclusion like you know

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.090 
was a logical conclusion like you know
maybe<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.289> think<00:01:37.320> otherwise<00:01:37.710> but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
maybe you'll think otherwise but

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.880 
maybe you'll think otherwise but
whatever<00:01:39.500> musically<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:41.159> can't<00:01:41.729> stress<00:01:42.119> enough

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
