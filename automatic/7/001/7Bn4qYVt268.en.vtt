00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.000 

and<00:03:44.370> also<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.689> like<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.079> arcade<00:03:46.469> game<00:03:46.739> it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and also just like the arcade game it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.830 
and also just like the arcade game it
doesn't<00:03:47.280> take<00:03:47.549> very<00:03:47.579> long<00:03:47.879> for<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.599> go

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
doesn't take very long for this to go

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:58.809 
doesn't take very long for this to go
from<00:03:49.170> really<00:03:49.650> bad<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.310> game<00:03:50.519> over

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.850 

the<00:03:59.819> next<00:04:00.120> game<00:04:00.390> tempest<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.230> never<00:04:01.530> really

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
the next game tempest I never really

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.949 
the next game tempest I never really
played<00:04:02.069> in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> arcade<00:04:02.819> but<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.659> didn't<00:04:03.840> have

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
played in the arcade but it didn't have

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.229 
played in the arcade but it didn't have
something<00:04:04.349> like<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.739> on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> commodore<00:04:05.370> 64

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
something like it on the commodore 64

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.869 
something like it on the commodore 64
once<00:04:07.200> again<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.620> d-pad<00:04:07.980> controls<00:04:08.190> hand<00:04:08.730> for

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
once again the d-pad controls hand for

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.949 
once again the d-pad controls hand for
the<00:04:08.940> game<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> little<00:04:09.360> but<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:09.720> still<00:04:09.900> very

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the game a little but it's still very

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.220 
the game a little but it's still very
playable<00:04:10.680> if<00:04:11.390> just<00:04:12.390> not<00:04:12.629> by<00:04:12.810> me

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
playable if just not by me

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:41.820 
playable if just not by me
I<00:04:13.260> seem<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.650> die<00:04:13.769> very<00:04:14.040> quickly

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.909 

this<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:43.490> asteroids<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.659> that's<00:04:45.650> about<00:04:45.800> all

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
this is asteroids and that's about all

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.580 
this is asteroids and that's about all
there<00:04:46.219> is<00:04:46.250> really<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.729> say<00:04:46.960> if<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.259> played

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
there is really to say if you played

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.170 
there is really to say if you played
this<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.009> arcade<00:04:49.370> then<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:49.729> know<00:04:50.000> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
this in the arcade then you know the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.820 
this in the arcade then you know the
game<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.479> you're<00:04:50.599> in<00:04:50.719> for<00:04:50.960> not<00:04:51.409> really<00:04:51.680> much

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
game that you're in for not really much

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.709 
game that you're in for not really much
has<00:04:51.979> changed<00:04:52.009> still<00:04:52.669> get<00:04:52.909> to<00:04:53.090> turn<00:04:53.419> around

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
has changed still get to turn around

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.929 
has changed still get to turn around
different<00:04:53.960> sides<00:04:54.319> I<00:04:54.680> get<00:04:55.250> smacked<00:04:55.699> by<00:04:55.879> the

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
different sides I get smacked by the

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.730 
different sides I get smacked by the
last<00:04:56.240> droids<00:04:56.569> to<00:04:56.840> shoot<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.139> big<00:04:57.289> asteroids

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
last droids to shoot the big asteroids

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.140 
last droids to shoot the big asteroids
they<00:04:57.889> become<00:04:58.159> smaller<00:04:58.460> asteroids<00:04:59.319> and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
they become smaller asteroids and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.429 
they become smaller asteroids and
generally<00:05:02.150> moving<00:05:02.599> is<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> bad<00:05:03.020> idea

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
generally moving is a bad idea

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.320 
generally moving is a bad idea
except<00:05:04.250> when<00:05:04.370> you're<00:05:04.520> about<00:05:04.879> to<00:05:05.000> be<00:05:05.090> hit<00:05:05.180> by<00:05:05.300> a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
except when you're about to be hit by a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:27.950 
except when you're about to be hit by a
rock

battlezone<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.170> game<00:05:29.410> that<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> really<00:05:30.310> don't

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
battlezone is a game that I really don't

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.310 
battlezone is a game that I really don't
remember<00:05:30.640> seeing<00:05:31.150> in<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.420> arcade<00:05:31.840> but<00:05:32.170> it

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
remember seeing in the arcade but it

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.860 
remember seeing in the arcade but it
hooked<00:05:32.620> me<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:32.980> matter<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.340> moments<00:05:33.910> you

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
hooked me in a matter of moments you

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.470 
hooked me in a matter of moments you
steer<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.260> tank<00:05:35.500> like<00:05:35.800> well<00:05:36.790> a<00:05:36.820> tank<00:05:37.240> which

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
steer the tank like well a tank which

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.120 
steer the tank like well a tank which
means<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:37.810> have<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.320> know<00:05:38.410> you<00:05:38.710> control<00:05:39.040> the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
means you have you know you control the

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.040 
means you have you know you control the
different<00:05:39.310> treads<00:05:39.700> separately<00:05:40.660> took<00:05:40.900> me<00:05:41.020> a

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
different treads separately took me a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.690 
different treads separately took me a
while<00:05:41.140> to<00:05:41.290> figure<00:05:41.410> that<00:05:41.680> out<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:42.490> try<00:05:42.670> and

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
while to figure that out and you try and

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.130 
while to figure that out and you try and
shoot<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.090> other<00:05:43.210> tank<00:05:43.510> before<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.930> tank

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
shoot the other tank before the tank

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.990 
shoot the other tank before the tank
shoots<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:44.670> now<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.960> weird<00:05:47.350> I<00:05:48.100> don't<00:05:48.670> know<00:05:48.760> if

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
shoots you now the weird I don't know if

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.520 
shoots you now the weird I don't know if
what<00:05:49.390> kind<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.630> graphics<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.170> would<00:05:50.320> call

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
what kind of graphics you would call

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.850 
what kind of graphics you would call
these<00:05:50.680> basically<00:05:51.190> just<00:05:52.350> vector<00:05:53.350> graphics<00:05:53.740> I

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
these basically just vector graphics I

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.180 
these basically just vector graphics I
guess<00:05:54.070> but<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.540> game<00:05:55.810> was<00:05:56.050> amazingly<00:05:56.860> fun

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
guess but this game was amazingly fun

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.880 
guess but this game was amazingly fun
and<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.460> made<00:05:57.640> me<00:05:57.820> want<00:05:58.090> to<00:05:58.270> play<00:05:58.620> this<00:05:59.620> game

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
and it made me want to play this game

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.170 
and it made me want to play this game
head-to-head<00:06:00.430> against<00:06:00.760> somebody

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
head-to-head against somebody

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.820 
head-to-head against somebody
unfortunately<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:01.990> didn't<00:06:02.290> have<00:06:02.410> anybody<00:06:02.590> else

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
unfortunately I didn't have anybody else

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.000 
unfortunately I didn't have anybody else
to<00:06:03.070> play<00:06:03.880> with<00:06:04.060> right<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:04.620> so<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.650> was<00:06:05.830> just

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
to play with right now so I was just

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:26.530 
to play with right now so I was just
kind<00:06:06.160> of<00:06:06.220> going<00:06:06.370> solo

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.600 

centipede<00:06:28.110> oh<00:06:28.140> this<00:06:28.770> sucked<00:06:29.040> away<00:06:29.190> so<00:06:29.430> many

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
centipede oh this sucked away so many

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.960 
centipede oh this sucked away so many
quarters<00:06:30.000> when<00:06:30.810> I<00:06:30.900> was<00:06:31.050> younger<00:06:31.410> in<00:06:32.250> this

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
quarters when I was younger in this

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.940 
quarters when I was younger in this
version<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.450> is<00:06:33.630> not<00:06:33.900> hampered<00:06:34.230> as<00:06:34.500> much<00:06:34.740> by

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
version it is not hampered as much by

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.430 
version it is not hampered as much by
not<00:06:35.100> having<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.550> ball<00:06:35.760> since<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:37.230> have<00:06:37.410> a

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
not having a ball since the you have a

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.380 
not having a ball since the you have a
limited<00:06:37.860> range<00:06:37.890> of<00:06:38.370> where<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:39.060> can<00:06:39.240> move

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
limited range of where you can move

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.930 
limited range of where you can move
pretty<00:06:40.080> much<00:06:40.230> from<00:06:40.440> where<00:06:40.620> I<00:06:40.650> just<00:06:40.740> was<00:06:41.160> over

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
pretty much from where I just was over

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.910 
pretty much from where I just was over
to<00:06:42.030> either<00:06:42.180> side<00:06:42.450> and<00:06:42.660> all<00:06:42.720> the<00:06:42.810> way<00:06:42.930> down<00:06:42.960> now

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
to either side and all the way down now

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.310 
to either side and all the way down now
it's<00:06:44.070> got<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.310> same<00:06:44.520> classic<00:06:45.030> sounds<00:06:45.600> that

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
it's got the same classic sounds that

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.410 
it's got the same classic sounds that
you<00:06:46.410> would<00:06:46.560> expect<00:06:46.950> and<00:06:47.280> it<00:06:47.460> plays<00:06:47.700> almost

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
you would expect and it plays almost

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.520 
you would expect and it plays almost
identical<00:06:49.730> really<00:06:50.730> good<00:06:50.880> port<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.470> I<00:06:52.470> die

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
identical really good port and I die

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.760 
identical really good port and I die
real<00:06:52.830> fast<00:06:53.070> as<00:06:53.370> always

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
real fast as always

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.430 
real fast as always
the<00:06:56.770> game<00:06:57.010> that<00:06:57.280> suffers<00:06:57.640> most<00:06:58.030> by<00:06:58.870> having<00:06:59.290> to

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
the game that suffers most by having to

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.870 
the game that suffers most by having to
use<00:06:59.770> the<00:07:00.310> d-pad<00:07:00.760> has<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.540> be<00:07:01.690> super<00:07:01.930> breakout

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
use the d-pad has to be super breakout

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.370 
use the d-pad has to be super breakout
now<00:07:03.880> the<00:07:03.940> d-pad<00:07:04.360> is<00:07:04.630> just<00:07:04.870> a<00:07:04.990> little<00:07:05.230> too

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
now the d-pad is just a little too

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.250 
now the d-pad is just a little too
touchy<00:07:05.590> for<00:07:05.920> this<00:07:06.040> game<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:07.840> controls

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
touchy for this game and the controls

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.480 
touchy for this game and the controls
would<00:07:08.500> have<00:07:08.620> been<00:07:08.740> much<00:07:08.890> better<00:07:09.070> if<00:07:09.190> you<00:07:09.370> would

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
would have been much better if you would

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.630 
would have been much better if you would
have<00:07:09.550> had<00:07:09.730> analog<00:07:10.240> controls<00:07:10.720> instead<00:07:11.080> of<00:07:11.260> the

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
have had analog controls instead of the

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.310 
have had analog controls instead of the
weird<00:07:12.640> accelerating<00:07:13.510> thing<00:07:13.840> that<00:07:13.990> you<00:07:14.080> have

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
weird accelerating thing that you have

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.810 
weird accelerating thing that you have
if<00:07:14.710> you<00:07:14.800> tap<00:07:15.040> the<00:07:15.250> button<00:07:15.280> it<00:07:15.520> moves<00:07:15.700> a<00:07:15.790> little

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
if you tap the button it moves a little

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.150 
if you tap the button it moves a little
bit<00:07:16.150> but<00:07:16.720> as<00:07:16.840> you<00:07:16.990> hold<00:07:17.200> it<00:07:17.380> it<00:07:17.530> increases<00:07:17.800> in

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
bit but as you hold it it increases in

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:34.290 
bit but as you hold it it increases in
speed<00:07:18.430> as<00:07:18.610> it<00:07:18.730> zips<00:07:18.970> across<00:07:32.850> to<00:07:33.850> additional

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
speed as it zips across to additional

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.120 
speed as it zips across to additional
features<00:07:34.660> that<00:07:34.690> make<00:07:35.050> this<00:07:35.260> collection<00:07:35.650> even

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.130 
features that make this collection even

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.550 
features that make this collection even
better<00:07:36.340> is<00:07:36.640> that<00:07:37.540> one<00:07:37.870> you<00:07:38.290> can<00:07:38.440> actually

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
better is that one you can actually

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.400 
better is that one you can actually
enter<00:07:38.950> in<00:07:39.480> the<00:07:40.480> on<00:07:40.600> the<00:07:40.720> high-score<00:07:41.110> board

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410 
enter in the on the high-score board

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.830 
enter in the on the high-score board
just<00:07:42.370> like<00:07:42.490> back<00:07:42.880> in<00:07:42.910> the<00:07:43.120> arcade<00:07:43.510> when<00:07:43.750> you

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
just like back in the arcade when you

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.230 
just like back in the arcade when you
had<00:07:44.020> those<00:07:44.370> three<00:07:45.370> little<00:07:45.490> letters<00:07:45.730> to<00:07:46.000> choose

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
had those three little letters to choose

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.540 
had those three little letters to choose
from<00:07:46.540> and<00:07:46.780> of<00:07:47.350> course<00:07:47.650> I<00:07:47.800> always<00:07:47.920> entered

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
from and of course I always entered
