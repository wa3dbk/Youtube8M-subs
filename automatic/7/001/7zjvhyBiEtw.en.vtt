00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:20.340
(music)

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:27.156
To be honest, this is what I thought happened when you submit a college application.

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:30.911
But when I applied to CU-Boulder, that's not what happened at all.

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:34.111
One day, I got ahold of my admissions counselor.

00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.424
I asked him how their application machine would process my application.

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:40.620
But there was no scary machine.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.720
See, my counselor -- this real, living, breathing human being --

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.685
is who would read my application, and know that I'm not just some numbers on a piece of paper.

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:54.265
He's able to see me as a real human being, too.

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:57.641
Of course, one of the first things he looks at is my GPA

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.480
to see how well I've done overall.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.347
If I'm a little worried about my GPA, I still have my senior year to bump that number up.

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:10.200
Counselors at CU-Boulder know that a GPA can only tell you so much.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
So they look closer, at things like the kinds of courses I've taken,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.920
my workload, and how consistent I've been.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.427
Maybe I stumbled a little along the way. Was I able to pick myself up and keep climbing?

00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:27.220
No matter how well I've done, though, I knew senior year was no free ride.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.372
They don't ask for final transcripts for nothing.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.160
When looking at test scores, they take the SAT or the ACT -- it doesn't matter.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.366
And I'll admit, my first attempt wasn't my best.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.070
But my counselor told me I could take it again,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.130
and they'd only look at my best scores from each section.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.930
After all the scores and grades and stuff,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.210
I knew the essays were my chance to let my counselors know why I belonged at CU-Boulder.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.125
I could write about the things I'm passionate about, the challenges I've overcome,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:03.100
experiences I've had, the important people in my life,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.060
you know -- the things that make me, well, me.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.151
And that's what the application is really meant to do.

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:13.901
To capture who you are, and how you're right for CU-Boulder.

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.741
And how CU-Boulder is the right place for you, too.

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.612
After I turned everything in, the hardest part was waiting.

00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:23.969
Some other people were getting in right away.

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.800
But I knew not everyone has the same path.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.608
And I might have to prove myself a bit more -- academically -- before I could get a decision.

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:35.606
Whatever your path, know you have more control than you think,

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:40.865
and it all comes down to working hard until the end, and continually trying to better yourself.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.959
Your counselor will be there for you the whole way.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.839
Remember, there is no application processing machine.
