other<00:00:34.290> EA<00:00:34.590> games<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.520> played

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
other EA games I think so if you played

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
other EA games I think so if you played
like<00:00:35.820> SSX<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.450> battlefield<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:38.460> bad

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
like SSX and battlefield not to not bad

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
like SSX and battlefield not to not bad
for<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:38.879> that's<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.239> EA<00:00:39.360> sport<00:00:39.750> but

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
for you because that's not EA sport but

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
for you because that's not EA sport but
NFL<00:00:40.890> NHL<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.610> stuff<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.940> that
