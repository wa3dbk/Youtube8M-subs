 increases autonomy 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 let's start working 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 He is a biologist and many divers domicile 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.720
 laura aladro 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.660
 then dt 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.530
 they were tuvimo talked about the future plane should tell the telethon was 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.880
 thinking 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.140
 in a plus in everything from 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.610
 so the side section is a very big opportunity of some solar 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 with respect to our future 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.800
 the company pointed 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.950
 a lot of uncertainty 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.330
 she lives with the will 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 with a great career 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.190
 Natalia

 also the academic institution and welcome to work 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.300
 but no 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.560
 after the big problem 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.780
 in each venue 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.210
 and there we find that read 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.710
 sometimes the computer comes from the group very strongly with an inflation 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.530
 to work for that purpose 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.700
 are also the themes that would originate in the young population the marm la 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.530
 medal of the foundation sm computer 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.040
 resurge in the group to this question of the aqueduct alcohol idea is a 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.540
 publication 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.960
 who more than allow once it surpasses interesting that allows that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.089
 reside there 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.859
 you have to work also account 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.159
 we are not going to send them teleworking mexico a part of the work can 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:13.869
 do 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.929
 the price of their houses 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.929
 we did what seems strange to us that it can be working together 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.359
 both highlighted 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.379
 the sale 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.579
 they give avenue loans the central state as 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.019
 reincarnated esfumaban entail the northern area of ​​the city of hama 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.039
 now we are like a 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.859
 a starved delighted miguel espinosa also has great end 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.079
 from Tuesday to Saturday 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:43.879
 bad signal 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.019
 there and that there is no longer any fear of one that we see 1 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.709
 one on the street of meta the county reads for sale some others are 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.769
 managing until now all this eleventh 2010 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 We are also facing your good work last January 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.579
 we both believe that encouraging common technology 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.709
 par excellence what allows people to collaborate to communicate and what about 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.639
 everything allows you to exploit the full potential 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.089
 to the people 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.040
 so in the case of these guys 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.869
 that sometimes have to face 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.619
 a lot of barriers precisely technology becomes this 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.980
 tool to handle the time 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.869
 your box 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.869
 to incorporate it as a tool for work and 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.189
 we inside there is no case 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.269
 we try to promote digital inclusion - a company that does this 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.670
 because he really believes that that was an idea of ​​people's potential for 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.379
 that's 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.340
 It's very good because they do not know how to bet on this group of seven people 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.379
 quirós of those who enter labor framework the present as good because 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.090
 He started with a handsome man outside the court, but he analyzed well Korea 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.099
 like the computers of the kids in the house but the first thing we did was 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.529
 communicated current office tuesday happens the same 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.009
 take off you could not do more and the world was adopted 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.549
 we ourselves are the ones that go to vargas is there toledo - we put together 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 boat málaga fecoma army sales that are most useful 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.899
 we have expectations and why 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.889
 it's not just the present signals using the computer and let go of the one who sucks 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.919
 the ancestor his magazine although he did not take the work kim 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.049
 dyn 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.139
 said area of ​​finance 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.290
 I have always in hyde 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.889
 song 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.099
 and what I'm going to do 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.039
 Earth and transparent 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.999
 literally to anyone the Argentinian is just for us 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.599
 now begins to make a dent 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.639
 in total they work 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 the minister also met in Argentina 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 gilani 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.939
 we build an identity apart from work 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.249
 that's why it's a good 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.619
 very valuable work does not serve to structure life 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.900
 and in this sense 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.919
 a good democratizing element 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.990
 because when you buy a quality product like it is a magazine and it makes 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.520
 circulate contents 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.550
 that are interesting and in addition to designing the reforms to Spain 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.519
 what is interesting is that product that is circulating here the people 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.490
 and what that can create this product aside the need for 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.710
 people 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.849
 a debut in australia and canada 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.889
 like the economy too 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.949
 throughout the week 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.889
 I like it 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.809
 but in the orange peel 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.139
 We are trying to make 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.969
 and if something good the legality 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.949
 and to the west with the family
