00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.360
 I have 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.019
 we have the bipolar heart show that is 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.730
 a very different show the soul 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.739
 fortunately, it's not you with a lot 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.329
 more interaction with people very 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.039
 excited because obviously they will be able to 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.780
 listen to the songs they know about 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.579
 discs gone serious but now I'm going to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.110
 to be able to present a little more of what 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.390
 that in bipolar heart and what comes to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.309
 the review issues as they say out there that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.560
 is the theme of Acapulco snout that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.320
 lover that good is a subject that I composed 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.630
 for marking and adjustment that makes it 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.860
 a total success that we sing live 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.330
 together in the national auditorium and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.330
 also going to be special missions

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.739
 things of the present continuous 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.390
 I am not those people who dream in a 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.579
 future 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.530
 so without enjoying the present I believe 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.269
 that the future is in every second that 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.069
 is ahead of us at this time 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.989
 the future is the scenario of tulancingo 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.609

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.959
