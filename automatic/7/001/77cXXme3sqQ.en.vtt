00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.500
 hello san francisco it's gray 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.790
 winter one and a half advanced cap 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.290
 from the south but what's going on this not what 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.060
 we will try the bigue and that's it 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.590
 americans do with their helmet 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.330
 can do battle and now the neo z 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.590
 in the rain they know well the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 chip of their country 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.270
 and so go on the water or give in 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.340
 on the neo z side it is enough to gain 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.020
 a final lie but while still 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.220
 more relaxed American side because that 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.930
 was already sailing not point 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.340
 villa said it would not happen to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.620
 listen to committee we scratch our heads very 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.750
 loud here we have alan bennett who 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 already officiated in valencia at the time of the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.890
 two huge catamarans in 2010 and 1 in 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.210
 a month and a half the season of course the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.810
 whales already have in the south to get 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.940
 reproduce 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.770
 the wind is across its course lot 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.150
 that is, we open down from 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.490
 gennaker the usual one makes ready 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.380
 from east to west 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.480
 as usual nothing and usual on 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.860
 its water has not changed and the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.820
 d central oz are maneuvers 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.050
 they know then that the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.190
 Americans train to not take themselves 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.750
 feet in their listening that would do 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.850
 bad effect of doing it twice 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 next and let's go back to the committee and here 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.050
 john wayne who will announce us that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.280
 finally and yes well troops left 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.960
 it's breaking it to the left and their 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.340
 across the course they are rendered 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.290
 be through the upwind is 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.640
 important is not to navigate this 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.220
 little course it does not detract from 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 the enthusiast of the neo z came en masse 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.150
 from their country down under there is 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 finally that 13 hours of plane is 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.909
 them the main audience they are all 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.850
 close to victory 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.710
 and rather than make a haka a bit 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.909
 Too soon I propose you from anc to more 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.890
 big world on the docks to do the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.360
 point on the ring road yesterday maybe 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.870
 throughout the match and regatta number 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.250
 13 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.720
 with the three important points of 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 this regatta and we can see the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.440
 Americans diving behind the neo z 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.479
 after the eu trail a little late 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 the essays to create the commitment answer 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.659
 neo z who shoot at the same time 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.580
 that they break the commitment that is played out at 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.049
 a meter at these speeds of madness and in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.430
 the water is behind the neo z se 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.220
 perfectly finds the dregs in a 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.479
 timing well controlled well playing superb 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.920
 answer who did you do you attacks a 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.760
 little late american so we are 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.140
 regatta number 13 on the 11th day of 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.000
 regatta won by the Americans 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.379
 and this is the first key point of this 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.659
 start of this regatta is at the start 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.170
 but neo z have responded perfectly to 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.599
 the attak 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 American and we even see from here 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.630
 the beginnings of regattas was oz 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.470
 are pretty unstable are struggling to hold 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.910
 today are not very good 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.440
 balanced whereas on the contrary the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.060
 americans in the american vent 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.560
 in the wind gets to be very stable 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.040
 and when they come to the boiling of 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.030
 reaching 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
 they'll be both in the air 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 but still these neo z with little unstable 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.580
 and the Americans are three seconds 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.040
 to go watch the high three seconds 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.739
 behind but very balanced is ready to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.660
 the attack key points number one of the day 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.550
 point number two gifts of the regatta 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.959
 number 13 everything starts here the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.069
 Americans triggered the jibe 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.660
 now while they come from 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.459
 reduce their speed by 105 their 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.680
 distance of 150 to 80 meters in the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.700
 laughter it goes into a soft neo z 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 are already in the soft they can not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.180
 respond very good timing of gybes 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.260
 and going to get to gauge again a 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.730
 little more in front of the Americans 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.709
 come back on the bab will have equality of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 neo z we see there all right and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.850
 in their rays not swim a minute of 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.930
 10 later the Americans down is 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.160
 also in the soft they are at the same 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.049
 time in the soft but there they are at 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.610
 equal and they are even ten meters 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.840
 before they will lose a little in their 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.569
 back starboard but you are still 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.980
 between 20 and 30 meters behind that is enough 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.510
 to make a real starboard babe 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.209
 watch the neo-z that appear 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.190
 port side alas and starboard starboard starboard 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.799
 bomisso under his touch 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.180
 they are 25 each it's 90 km / hour 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.130
 and very clearly penalty for the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.110
 kiwis in this regatta number 13 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.280
 and everything is ready for the third round 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.900
 of the match which in my opinion is a real 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.450
 fundamental turning it's all the way down to 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.680
 the door of the Americans down then 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.090
 that they come back same situation first 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.070
 than previous gentlemen who are port side 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.510
 and at the moment of this gambols and neo 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.920
 z just left riad and there they are at 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.470
 three does not throw a disaster just from 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.550
 make two gybes on the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.050
 Americans had the commitment for the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.580
 right hilton dumpling are at 10 knots 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.630
 the neo z are also at dinner on the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.220
 left dumpling and just before the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.570
 our ferry hides us everything goes 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.340
 common are stopped these 20 seconds 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.700
 to advance the real turning point of the match of 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.740
 this regatta 13 well played the Americans 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.120
 and here we are back day 11 spleen to 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.890
 the regattas canceled during which 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.030
 sailors of course sails and here on 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.560
 the American ship look at 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.700
 training down left threat s 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.860
 is applied his favorite sport by 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.550
 the electronic technician of the day eagerly tomorrow 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.550
 that's the strength
