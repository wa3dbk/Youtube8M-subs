a lot of positive feedback from that
comment<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:20.100> decided<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.270> something

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
comment so i decided it was something

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540 
comment so i decided it was something
that<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.140> guys<00:00:22.350> would<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> from<00:00:23.400> me

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that you guys would want to see from me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
that you guys would want to see from me
and<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.689> something<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> lot<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and it's not something that a lot of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
and it's not something that a lot of
people<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.310> YouTube<00:00:26.670> due<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> thought

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
people here on YouTube due so I thought

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
people here on YouTube due so I thought
so<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> video<00:00:28.560> probably<00:00:28.800> won't<00:00:29.070> be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
so this video probably won't be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.859 
so this video probably won't be
extremely<00:00:29.789> long<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.480> not<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
extremely long because I'm not going to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
extremely long because I'm not going to
go<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> deep<00:00:31.650> explanation<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> what

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
go into like a deep explanation of what

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.430 
go into like a deep explanation of what
I'm<00:00:32.790> doing<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> shower<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:34.290> that

I'm doing in the shower because that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
around here just the crown of my head

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500 
around here just the crown of my head
and<00:02:23.710> for<00:02:24.130> conditioner<00:02:24.640> i<00:02:24.670> only<00:02:25.030> put<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.360> my

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.720 
and for conditioner i only put it on my
ends<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:27.100> roots<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.550> your<00:02:27.670> hair

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
ends because the roots of your hair

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
ends because the roots of your hair
already<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> lot<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> natural<00:02:29.050> oil<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.860> it

already have a lot of natural oil in it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.530 
already have a lot of natural oil in it
so<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.550> doesn't<00:02:30.610> need<00:02:30.910> any<00:02:31.090> extra

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so it doesn't need any extra

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.680 
so it doesn't need any extra
conditioning<00:02:32.230> treatment<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.430> only<00:02:34.060> your<00:02:34.300> ends

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
conditioning treatment so only your ends

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.330
