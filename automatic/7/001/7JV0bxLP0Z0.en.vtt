 hello everyone marina and 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.620
 This video tutorial I will tell you how to open 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.880
 ports on windows 7 for your server 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.280
 ks16 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 or maycroft well suited for 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.770
 absolutely any syrup where used 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.330
 port so for this we need any 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.010
 client downloader it goes as a torrent we 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.579
 diabetes or magic don't know how to and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.559
 perhaps more suitable whatever his damn 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:49.569
 the zone may suit other tapes. 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:57.850
 here let's go let's go to the browser write 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:01:02.280
 ip dot ru so here's your ip address then 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 okay go to the port fitting tab and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.600
 I will open the port today 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 let's let's go some 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:24.720
 let's say let's say okay 27 015 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.720
 here is the most click to check 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.480
 here we write the port is closed 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.780
 how to open it you ask let's 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.950
 go to the torrent 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.260
 Here's settings tab 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 here's your configuration 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.580
 here you can change the interface language 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.170
 here is english 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.290
 Rashim and then go to the tray 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.580
 connections as we see the port is open 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.160
 27,021 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.190
 you probably will not even write 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.610
 perhaps he will write some other 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 but it will generally be used by you 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.970
 on the computer but how can I change it 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.490
 just write here like what port we are 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.950
 want to open 27 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:28.980
 015 we will open push 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:32.920
 apply okay and preferably restart 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 your browser because well this port 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.600
 applied on the computer here you can even 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.390
 torrent close here even 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.670
 well here you can also close on 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 I won't do it this way 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:55.600
 port check and we opened 2705 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:00.580
 click check port open as 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 see here let's still demonstrate 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.459
 for minecraft port also from 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.900
 torrent configuration settings 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:16.030
 connections and write here port 200 55-65 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 I usually have minecraft here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.730
 it is necessary to click apply okay so now 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.070
 try just like that 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.700
 check as you can see the port is open like this 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.700
 so so so so 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.840
 let's get some more evidence 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 I'll show here 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.970
 close the port to lead 55-65 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:55.350
 here's how we go here is port 255 port 65 is open 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:59.550
 click to check the course is here as a form of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:08.390
 writes port is closed but I will put it to 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:12.450
 we had open click ok and check 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:17.280
 all like that open ports even if 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.520
 want and had to demonstrate well that 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.920
 everything comes to my server 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.540
 minecraft assembly and we you can download 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.060
 Well, rather lay out 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.300
 if you want to give Tomsk sands 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.870
 Something will not be shorter Like the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:43.520
 write in the comments and so I laid out 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:49.220
 your server and such a pancake apologized 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:57.990
 and so the server can see them as mainkraftu 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 Here are the series so 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.490
 as we see here the port here costs 200 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.020
 55-65 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.730
 if i change now 255 66 we have it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.430
 thing we have this port is not well not open and 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.560
 on the server should not come here 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.690
 we start the server 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.120
 my heart won't start now 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:27.270
 oh no run on 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.420
 and here is how you see here is shorter here writes 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.630
 what you don't have well maybe server already 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:39.710
 used well on this parte 2 that ok 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:44.970
 let's change to 200 55-65 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:48.420
 so click save and maybe again 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:54.410
 the server will not start because yes here 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.410
 how do you see run even know why 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.050
 here
