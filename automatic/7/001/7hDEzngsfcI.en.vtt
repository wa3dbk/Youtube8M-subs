to post it to everybody I don't know
what's<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:27.210> were<00:00:27.330> talking<00:00:27.660> about

what's going on we were talking about

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
what's going on we were talking about
the<00:00:29.099> differences<00:00:29.640> between<00:00:29.990> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the differences between the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.729 
the differences between the
american-made<00:00:31.880> fender<00:00:32.960> jazz<00:00:33.960> basses<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.469> P

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
american-made fender jazz basses and P

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.680 
american-made fender jazz basses and P
basis<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.000> M<00:00:36.149> IM<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> Mexican<00:00:37.590> made

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
basis and the M IM is the Mexican made

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
basis and the M IM is the Mexican made
fender<00:00:39.690> jazz<00:00:39.870> bass<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.620> enough<00:00:40.950> p<00:00:41.489> basis<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
fender jazz bass is enough p basis and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.319 
fender jazz bass is enough p basis and
was<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.530> lot<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> different<00:00:44.579> quality

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
was there a lot of different quality

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
was there a lot of different quality
between<00:00:45.480> them<00:00:45.899> both<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.350> pretty<00:00:46.680> good<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> me

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
between them both are pretty good to me

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
between them both are pretty good to me
I<00:00:48.440> think<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> fender<00:00:50.449> jazz<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.690> american-made

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I think the fender jazz is american-made

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
I think the fender jazz is american-made
maybe<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.489> detail<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> little

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
maybe with a little more detail a little

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
maybe with a little more detail a little
different<00:00:54.600> bridges<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.140> stuff<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.559> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
different bridges and stuff like that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.389 
different bridges and stuff like that
and<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.660> love<00:00:58.399> whereas

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and just a little bit more love whereas

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.599 
and just a little bit more love whereas
the<00:00:59.609> Mexicans<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.420> still<00:01:01.020> great<00:01:01.440> quality<00:01:02.070> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the Mexicans are still great quality but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
the Mexicans are still great quality but
maybe<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.510> lesser<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.170> was

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
maybe a little lesser and I was

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
maybe a little lesser and I was
wondering<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.750> makes<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
wondering do you really think it makes a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
wondering do you really think it makes a
difference<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.770> you've<00:01:08.010> owned<00:01:08.250> both<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.670> them
