00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.760
 contador 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 who will be 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800

 isolated among his attacking even during the third stage we 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.720
 installs a nice border stroke for the American

 since GAS cohesion fund the time trial by teams of 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.200
 montpellier 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.570
 he put on track 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.600
 the lorientais on this ground 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700
 finally 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 the reflex 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.320
 the arrival at arcalis which allowed to place the first banderilla 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.979

 the second blade even sharper to verbier take them 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660
 definitely things in hand 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.310
 and sandra crushed the ride of all his class 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.450
 this 19th of July 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950
 it is submitted to his new boss 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.610

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.989
 he has on his final victory in the annecy chrono 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.289
 at the lake you expect manager he was 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.129
 on the 40 km 500 of an extremely intelligent course it is the only 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.029
 finally be able to shoot down the superficial and fabian cancellara Olympic champion of 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.389
 the speciality 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.149
 it is more complete 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.199
 in mont ventoux he easily thwarted the last trap concocted 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.509
 by trajectories 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.509
 pace taking distance but nothing helps 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.599
 at 26 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.049

 my agent bourquin 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.889
 the size of his opponents is at high risk of his skin
