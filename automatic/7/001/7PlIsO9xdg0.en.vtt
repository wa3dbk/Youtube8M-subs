some of the other mini bosses which is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.950 
some of the other mini bosses which is

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
probably why it doesn't really seem like

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.700 
probably why it doesn't really seem like
a<00:01:15.140> mini<00:01:15.380> boss<00:01:15.560> itself<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.960> he<00:01:18.110> can't<00:01:18.350> move<00:01:18.500> on

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
until he's beaten it so it's kind of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.170 
until he's beaten it so it's kind of
forced<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.100> be<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.219> mini<00:01:22.430> boss<00:01:22.579> in<00:01:22.850> people's

hit<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.840> then<00:03:12.989> when<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> enemy<00:03:13.319> died<00:03:13.650> they'd

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.759 
hit and then when the enemy died they'd
have<00:03:14.010> went<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.400> willingly<00:03:15.330> or<00:03:16.319> something<00:03:16.650> like
