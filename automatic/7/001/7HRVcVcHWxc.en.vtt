Cody hey as you say that he trips oh
that's<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.889> costly<00:02:51.340> air<00:02:51.489> for<00:02:51.790> them

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
that's a costly air for them

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.920 
that's a costly air for them
unfortunately

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930

now<00:02:55.530> Cody's<00:02:56.069> got<00:02:56.219> great<00:02:56.430> potential

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:39.500

I<00:03:42.980> think<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.159> fair<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> say<00:03:44.640> they<00:03:45.360> are<00:03:45.599> so

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
I think it's fair to say they are so

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.830 
I think it's fair to say they are so
