the 6g crystals with you
right<00:03:33.750> now<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:35.670> them<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:35.940> every<00:03:36.060> speed<00:03:36.510> or<00:03:36.660> set

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
right now get them in every speed or set

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.369 
right now get them in every speed or set
course<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.849> I'm<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.989> arch<00:03:40.140> was

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
course and then I'm with the arch was

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.470 
course and then I'm with the arch was
set<00:03:40.620> here<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.129> at<00:03:41.310> our<00:03:41.489> target<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> main

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
set here is at our target and the main

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.530 
set here is at our target and the main
objective<00:03:42.599> is<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:45.050> take<00:03:46.050> your<00:03:46.290> speed<00:03:46.500> or<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
objective is to take your speed or and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.180 
objective is to take your speed or and
go<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.489> try<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.730> hit<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.620> highest

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
go here and try and hit it the highest

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.059 
go here and try and hit it the highest
so<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.760> higher<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.239> hit<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.720> if<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.800> hit<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
so the higher you hit it if you hit it

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.370 
so the higher you hit it if you hit it
the<00:03:56.310> highest<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.390> your<00:03:57.540> opponent<00:03:57.780> gets<00:03:58.110> it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the highest so if your opponent gets it

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.270 
the highest so if your opponent gets it
to<00:03:58.680> about<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.819> orange<00:04:00.269> marker<00:04:00.840> there<00:04:01.280> and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
to about the orange marker there and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.250 
to about the orange marker there and
then<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.580> get<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:03.060> maximum<00:04:03.569> cheap<00:04:04.049> power

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
then you get it to maximum cheap power

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.710 
then you get it to maximum cheap power
on<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> blue<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.910> win<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.390> how<00:04:06.569> it

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
on the blue you will win and how it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.780 
on the blue you will win and how it
works<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.380> got<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.040> here<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.640> that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
works is you got this here and that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.380 
works is you got this here and that
pushes<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.380> there<00:04:11.130> which<00:04:11.940> then<00:04:12.150> pushes

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
pushes on that there which then pushes

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.690 
pushes on that there which then pushes
that<00:04:12.660> lever<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:14.040> course<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.459> is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that lever up and of course that is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.650 
that lever up and of course that is
angled<00:04:15.360> down<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:16.889> we<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.970> they<00:04:18.419> say<00:04:18.630> that

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
angled down so that we can they say that

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.469 
angled down so that we can they say that
it<00:04:18.989> works<00:04:19.350> properly<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.970> can<00:04:21.150> see<00:04:21.299> they've

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
it works properly you can see they've

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.180 
it works properly you can see they've
even<00:04:21.810> got<00:04:21.930> some<00:04:22.169> trees<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.740> here<00:04:22.950> because<00:04:23.100> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
even got some trees on here because this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.560 
even got some trees on here because this
is<00:04:23.250> supposed<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.760> be<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.060> gorilla<00:04:24.270> forest

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
is supposed to be in the gorilla forest

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.310 
is supposed to be in the gorilla forest
and<00:04:25.160> then<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.400> buck<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.790> pretty<00:04:27.030> plain<00:04:27.330> and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and then the buck is pretty plain and

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.110 
and then the buck is pretty plain and
just<00:04:28.530> pretty<00:04:29.100> much<00:04:29.280> see<00:04:29.610> how<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.850> feature

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
just pretty much see how the feature

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.790 
just pretty much see how the feature
works<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.440> side<00:04:31.650> there<00:04:33.800> nothing

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
works and then on the side there nothing

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.310 
works and then on the side there nothing
too<00:04:35.669> fancy<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.650> without<00:04:38.039> further<00:04:38.370> ado<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:40.160> shall

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
too fancy so without further ado I shall

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.700 
too fancy so without further ado I shall
put<00:04:43.320> camera<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.760> let's<00:04:45.180> try<00:04:45.780> out<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.350> tower

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
put camera and let's try out the tower

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.190 
put camera and let's try out the tower
target<00:04:47.400> may<00:04:47.970> be<00:04:48.030> better<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.479> stick<00:04:48.870> those

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
target may be better to stick those

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.640 
target may be better to stick those
understood<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.970> we<00:04:51.060> can<00:04:51.240> get<00:04:51.479> some<00:04:51.930> maximum

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
understood so we can get some maximum

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.200 
understood so we can get some maximum
cheap<00:04:53.610> power

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.110 

that's<00:04:58.210> better<00:04:58.740> okay<00:04:59.740> so<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.490> leather<00:05:00.700> starts

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's better okay so the leather starts

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.520 
that's better okay so the leather starts
right<00:05:01.300> at<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.540> bottom<00:05:01.810> line<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.140> got<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.380> try

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
right at the bottom line you got to try

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.170 
right at the bottom line you got to try
and<00:05:02.650> get<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.830> up<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:02.980> maximum<00:05:03.400> tree<00:05:03.730> power<00:05:03.940> if

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
and get it up to maximum tree power if

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.950 
and get it up to maximum tree power if
you<00:05:04.300> can<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:06.250> faster<00:05:06.670> the<00:05:06.760> speed<00:05:07.060> or<00:05:07.240> is

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
you can so the faster the speed or is

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.080 
you can so the faster the speed or is
his<00:05:08.140> Charge<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.740> faster<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.310> speed<00:05:09.580> or<00:05:09.820> the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
his Charge the faster the speed or the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.710 
his Charge the faster the speed or the
better<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:11.320> let's<00:05:11.920> go<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:15.040> look<00:05:15.550> we<00:05:16.270> actually

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
better so let's go and look we actually

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.010 
better so let's go and look we actually
did<00:05:16.960> get<00:05:17.170> it<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.500> maximum<00:05:18.040> cheap<00:05:18.520> hour<00:05:19.020> so

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
did get it to maximum cheap hour so

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.190 
did get it to maximum cheap hour so
let's<00:05:20.410> try<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.580> again<00:05:21.640> we<00:05:22.180> put<00:05:22.360> our<00:05:22.540> rip<00:05:22.870> cord

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
let's try that again we put our rip cord

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.840 
let's try that again we put our rip cord
in<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.880> go<00:05:25.060> again<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:26.830> time<00:05:27.100> we<00:05:27.250> only<00:05:27.370> got<00:05:27.670> it

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
in and go again that time we only got it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.360 
in and go again that time we only got it
to<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.240> orange<00:05:28.690> marker<00:05:29.230> which<00:05:29.410> isn't<00:05:29.830> maximum

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
to the orange marker which isn't maximum

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.060 
to the orange marker which isn't maximum
cheap<00:05:30.610> power<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:32.260> we'll<00:05:32.410> try<00:05:32.590> one<00:05:32.860> more<00:05:33.010> time

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
cheap power and we'll try one more time

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.550 
cheap power and we'll try one more time
and<00:05:33.400> then<00:05:33.460> show<00:05:33.790> you<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:34.030> slow-motion<00:05:34.510> replay

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.590 

I've<00:05:38.560> got<00:05:38.800> hand<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:39.220> just<00:05:39.430> hitting<00:05:40.270> back<00:05:40.420> my

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
I've got hand it just hitting back my

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.110 
I've got hand it just hitting back my
studio<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:42.580> case<00:05:43.360> popped<00:05:43.780> up<00:05:44.670> what<00:05:45.670> we<00:05:45.850> slow

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
studio the case popped up what we slow

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.470 
studio the case popped up what we slow
motion<00:05:46.450> replaying<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:47.610> let's<00:05:48.610> just<00:05:48.940> go<00:05:49.270> one

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
motion replaying that let's just go one

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.750 
motion replaying that let's just go one
more<00:05:49.630> time<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:50.080> try<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.350> get<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:51.400> into<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
more time and try and get it into the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.380 
more time and try and get it into the
tower<00:05:52.120> target<00:05:56.130> there<00:05:57.130> we<00:05:57.220> go<00:05:57.370> again<00:05:57.730> maximum

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
tower target there we go again maximum

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.450 
tower target there we go again maximum
cheap<00:05:58.780> power<00:05:59.050> which<00:05:59.710> is<00:05:59.860> what<00:06:00.010> you're<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.160> need

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
cheap power which is what you're a need

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.330 
cheap power which is what you're a need
to<00:06:00.490> get<00:06:00.820> if<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.120> want<00:06:01.390> to<00:06:01.600> win<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.260> now<00:06:03.100> let's

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
to get if you want to win so now let's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.250 
to get if you want to win so now let's
look<00:06:03.430> at<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.700> slow-motion<00:06:04.180> replay<00:06:04.840> and<00:06:05.050> go<00:06:05.169> on

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
look at a slow-motion replay and go on

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:36.800 
look at a slow-motion replay and go on
to<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.440> ratings<00:06:05.800> for<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.340> set

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.510 

okay<00:06:37.810> so<00:06:37.870> now<00:06:38.260> that<00:06:38.290> you<00:06:38.470> have<00:06:38.530> seen<00:06:38.680> that<00:06:39.040> slow

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
okay so now that you have seen that slow

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.730 
okay so now that you have seen that slow
motion<00:06:39.880> replay<00:06:40.300> now<00:06:41.110> let's<00:06:41.350> go<00:06:41.470> into<00:06:41.500> the

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
motion replay now let's go into the

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.310 
motion replay now let's go into the
rating<00:06:42.040> sponsor<00:06:42.580> and<00:06:42.790> overall<00:06:43.300> again<00:06:43.960> just

rating sponsor and overall again just

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.290 
rating sponsor and overall again just
like<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.530> clock<00:06:44.890> Trump<00:06:45.250> I'm<00:06:45.520> going<00:06:45.760> to<00:06:45.880> have

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
like the clock Trump I'm going to have

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.950 
like the clock Trump I'm going to have
to<00:06:46.330> give<00:06:46.660> this<00:06:46.780> money<00:06:47.050> 10<00:06:47.640> really<00:06:48.780> really<00:06:49.780> a

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
to give this money 10 really really a

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.340 
to give this money 10 really really a
good<00:06:50.260> speedo<00:06:50.650> challenge<00:06:51.130> where<00:06:51.550> you<00:06:51.700> can<00:06:51.910> just

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
good speedo challenge where you can just

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:59.010 
good speedo challenge where you can just
fit<00:06:53.350> on<00:06:53.560> that<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:54.130> it<00:06:54.280> pushes<00:06:55.320> the<00:06:56.320> chiba<00:06:58.020> look

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
fit on that and it pushes the chiba look

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.110 
fit on that and it pushes the chiba look
to<00:06:59.440> maximum<00:07:00.010> tree<00:07:00.190> if<00:07:00.310> you<00:07:00.430> want<00:07:00.610> they<00:07:00.850> can

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
to maximum tree if you want they can

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.960 
to maximum tree if you want they can
angle<00:07:01.510> that<00:07:01.660> a<00:07:01.840> bit<00:07:02.020> if<00:07:02.110> you<00:07:02.230> want<00:07:02.440> but<00:07:02.830> it's<00:07:03.760> on

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
angle that a bit if you want but it's on

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.310 
angle that a bit if you want but it's on
that<00:07:04.150> hinge<00:07:04.390> so<00:07:04.720> you<00:07:04.780> can<00:07:04.990> get<00:07:05.080> it<00:07:05.200> at<00:07:05.290> the

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
that hinge so you can get it at the

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.210 
that hinge so you can get it at the
right<00:07:05.440> angle<00:07:05.830> and<00:07:06.900> if<00:07:07.900> you<00:07:08.050> do<00:07:08.170> it<00:07:08.320> really<00:07:08.770> slow

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
right angle and if you do it really slow

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.720 
right angle and if you do it really slow
it<00:07:09.400> will<00:07:09.550> push<00:07:09.850> it<00:07:10.090> up<00:07:10.300> there<00:07:10.920> good<00:07:11.920> speed<00:07:12.340> if

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
it will push it up there good speed if

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.280 
it will push it up there good speed if
this<00:07:12.910> video's<00:07:13.270> to<00:07:13.450> go<00:07:13.540> all<00:07:13.780> the<00:07:13.900> way<00:07:13.930> through

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
this video's to go all the way through

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.890 
this video's to go all the way through
it<00:07:14.440> will<00:07:14.590> push<00:07:14.800> it<00:07:15.010> up<00:07:15.190> here<00:07:15.660> then<00:07:16.660> it<00:07:16.750> will

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
it will push it up here then it will

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.290 
it will push it up here then it will
just<00:07:16.930> fall<00:07:17.440> the<00:07:18.010> lover<00:07:18.310> will<00:07:18.430> just<00:07:18.760> fall<00:07:19.060> back

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
just fall the lover will just fall back

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.820 
just fall the lover will just fall back
to<00:07:19.360> what<00:07:20.050> it<00:07:20.080> is<00:07:20.290> Biff<00:07:20.620> it<00:07:20.710> goes<00:07:20.860> full<00:07:21.160> power

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
to what it is Biff it goes full power

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.280 
to what it is Biff it goes full power
well<00:07:23.830> fricking<00:07:24.250> it<00:07:24.370> is<00:07:24.490> a<00:07:24.520> bit<00:07:24.730> hard<00:07:25.240> it<00:07:26.020> will

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
well fricking it is a bit hard it will

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.110 
well fricking it is a bit hard it will
stay<00:07:26.800> on<00:07:26.830> cheap<00:07:27.190> hour<00:07:27.510> so<00:07:29.340> also<00:07:30.340> a<00:07:30.580> very<00:07:30.850> good

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
stay on cheap hour so also a very good

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.640 
stay on cheap hour so also a very good
way<00:07:31.270> to<00:07:31.300> get<00:07:31.540> Grissom<00:07:31.840> because<00:07:32.110> this<00:07:32.290> is<00:07:32.440> the

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 
way to get Grissom because this is the

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.050 
way to get Grissom because this is the
only<00:07:32.890> other<00:07:33.280> way<00:07:33.400> to<00:07:33.430> get<00:07:33.640> them<00:07:33.790> the<00:07:33.970> only

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
only other way to get them the only
