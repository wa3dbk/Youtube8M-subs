to<00:01:01.770> use<00:01:01.800> surf<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.430> recommend<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.030> whale

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to use surf I recommend using whale

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
to use surf I recommend using whale
Wailord<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.350> relicanth<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.810> you're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
Wailord or relicanth and then you're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
Wailord or relicanth and then you're
just<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> surf<00:01:07.830> down<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
just going to want to surf down here you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.960 
just going to want to surf down here you
can<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> tides<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:10.549> pretty<00:01:11.549> strong

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
can see that the tides are pretty strong

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
can see that the tides are pretty strong
so<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.630> sure<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> follow<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.619> route

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
exactly otherwise you could mess up and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.130 
exactly otherwise you could mess up and
you're<00:01:18.270> gonna<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> start<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.080> over

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you're gonna have to start all over

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.890 
you're gonna have to start all over
again<00:01:24.140> then<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.400> down

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.340 

all<00:01:30.860> right<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.100> once<00:01:31.250> you've<00:01:31.480> cap<00:01:32.480> make<00:01:33.200> sure

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
you pack some snacks repel as well

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.380 
you pack some snacks repel as well
because<00:01:35.540> running<00:01:35.930> into<00:01:36.290> some<00:01:36.470> wild<00:01:36.740> Pokemon

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
because running into some wild Pokemon

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.790 
because running into some wild Pokemon
isn't<00:01:38.390> always<00:01:38.510> fun<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.200> you're<00:01:42.350> going<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.560> go

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
isn't always fun so you're going to go

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.220 
isn't always fun so you're going to go
all<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.700> way<00:01:44.120> down<00:01:44.500> about<00:01:45.500> here<00:01:46.010> about<00:01:47.230> here

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
all the way down about here about here

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.730 
all the way down about here about here
and<00:01:48.440> then<00:01:49.630> I'm<00:01:50.630> going<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.840> use<00:01:51.020> surf<00:01:51.230> again<00:01:51.410> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
and then I'm going to use surf again and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.500 
and then I'm going to use surf again and
this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.220> final<00:01:52.550> part<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:53.240> we'll<00:01:53.390> take

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
this is the final part and we'll take

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.930 
this is the final part and we'll take
you<00:01:53.690> straight<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.220> sealed<00:01:55.460> chamber<00:01:55.520> right

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
you straight to the sealed chamber right

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.290 
you straight to the sealed chamber right
here

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
here

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.470 
here
