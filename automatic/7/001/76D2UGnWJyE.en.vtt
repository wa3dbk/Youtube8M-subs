it would Bend back and it would cause

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
it would Bend back and it would cause
less<00:02:02.040> damage<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> case<00:02:03.090> when<00:02:03.329> you'd<00:02:03.450> wind

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
less damage not the case when you'd wind

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.200

up<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.079> would<00:02:04.170> flex<00:02:04.469> back<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> whip<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
up it would flex back like a whip and it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.479 
up it would flex back like a whip and it
would<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.860> impact<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.429> be

would you know that the impact would be
like<00:02:08.700> double<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> was

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
like double what it would be if it was

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
like double what it would be if it was
