 jürgen kramny and his team are 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.790
 because of the many game losses still 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.090
 not really in the game rhythm 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.070

 conclusion of the vfb in the white jerseys 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 with the same startelf as at the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.769

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.800

 sulu almost the gateway for darmstadt 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.500
 after less than 60 seconds darmstadt 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.140
 much more snappy in the early stages of the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 vfb only at standards with a touch 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.149
 by torgefahr rocker in the arms of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.329
 carpenter a defender ensures 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.159
 for the best chance of the vfb storm in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.670
 the first half hour completely 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 then unsubscribed on the other side 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.590
 Variant back to bayer and that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.560
 preston zimmerman one to zero for 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.689
 darmstadt the american uses the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 unsorted in the vfb defense 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.220

 guests fans 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.039

 röcker a darmstadt stands behind very 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.860
 compact and needs only a few stations 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 for a successful attack 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.160
