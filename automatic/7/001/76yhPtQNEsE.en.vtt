top<00:00:04.770> exercises<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:06.210> peak<00:00:06.480> performance<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.799> we

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
top exercises for peak performance if we

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.459 
top exercises for peak performance if we
think<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.490> running<00:00:08.760> movement<00:00:09.469> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
think about the running movement the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
think about the running movement the
running<00:00:10.769> movement<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.370> broken<00:00:11.639> down<00:00:11.759> into

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
running movement can be broken down into

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.129 
running movement can be broken down into
a<00:00:12.769> phase<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.040> pulling<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.730> pushing<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.929> is

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
a phase of pulling and pushing that is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.560 
a phase of pulling and pushing that is
we<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.440> pulling<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.369> arm<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.240> push

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
we are pulling with one arm as we push

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
we are pulling with one arm as we push
through<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.170> other<00:00:19.289> arm<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:20.189> create

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
through with the other arm to create

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.859 
through with the other arm to create
rotation<00:00:21.060> through<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> upper<00:00:21.510> body<00:00:21.630> which

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
rotation through the upper body which

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.560 
rotation through the upper body which
helps<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> propel<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:23.100> body<00:00:23.340> forward<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.000> our

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
helps to propel our body forward as our

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
helps to propel our body forward as our
legs<00:00:24.869> move<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.830> over<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.250> other<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
legs move one over the other in this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
legs move one over the other in this
case<00:00:27.720> we're<00:00:27.990> looking<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.650> arm<00:00:28.859> pull

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
case we're looking at a one arm pull

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.359 
case we're looking at a one arm pull
movement<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.630> pulling<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.380> banned<00:00:32.009> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
movement I'm pulling them banned in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.549 
movement I'm pulling them banned in
towards<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.180> ribs<00:00:33.450> touching<00:00:34.050> lightly<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
towards my ribs touching lightly on the

towards my ribs touching lightly on the
ribs<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:35.340> rotation<00:00:36.030> through<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> upper

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
ribs with rotation through the upper

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
ribs with rotation through the upper
body<00:00:36.719> notice<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> right<00:00:38.730> arm<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
body notice that the right arm is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540 
body notice that the right arm is
pulling<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.930> left<00:00:40.200> foot<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> forward<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
pulling as the left foot is forward and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.690 
pulling as the left foot is forward and
of<00:00:42.120> course<00:00:42.329> vice<00:00:42.570> versa<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.430> right<00:00:44.430> foot

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of course vice versa the right foot

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
of course vice versa the right foot
would<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.910> forward<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.870> were<00:00:46.020> pulling<00:00:46.230> with

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
would be forward if we were pulling with

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
would be forward if we were pulling with
the<00:00:46.559> left<00:00:46.770> arm<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> case<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.420> seeing

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the left arm in this case you're seeing

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
the left arm in this case you're seeing
the<00:00:48.840> push<00:00:49.170> movement<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.829> run<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.789> see

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the push movement of run you can see

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.610 
the push movement of run you can see
that<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.360> again<00:00:51.629> rotation<00:00:52.350> through<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that there's again rotation through the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
that there's again rotation through the
upper<00:00:52.800> body<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.579> include<00:00:54.090> rotation<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
upper body we include rotation with this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
upper body we include rotation with this
exercise<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.309> run<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.879> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
exercise because as we run we have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
exercise because as we run we have
rotation<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> core<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.730> teach

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
rotation through the core we can teach

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
rotation through the core we can teach
our<00:01:00.120> core<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.629> strong<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> static

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
our core to be strong in a static

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
our core to be strong in a static
position<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.539> running<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.260> be

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
position but for running it would be

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
position but for running it would be
more<00:01:04.619> important<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.220> us<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> teach<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> core

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
more important for us to teach the core

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.880 
more important for us to teach the core
to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.659> strong<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.580> dynamic<00:01:08.580> position

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
to be strong through a dynamic position

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
to be strong through a dynamic position
again<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.220> pushing<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.270> hand

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
again we're pushing with the right hand

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
again we're pushing with the right hand
with<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> left<00:01:13.830> foot<00:01:14.010> forward<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:15.330> course

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
with the left foot forward and of course

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.050 
with the left foot forward and of course
vice<00:01:15.750> versa<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> pushing<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
vice versa we would be pushing with the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.780 
vice versa we would be pushing with the
left<00:01:18.270> hand<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.900> foot<00:01:18.930> forward

left hand with the right foot forward
notice<00:01:20.790> also<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.630> pull<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.259> we

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
notice also that as we pull and as we

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
notice also that as we pull and as we
push<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.460> standing<00:01:23.700> tall<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> neutral

is in a neutral stance what's important

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
is in a neutral stance what's important
to<00:01:32.280> remember<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.450> run<00:01:33.720> we're

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to remember is that as we run we're

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
to remember is that as we run we're
doing<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> push<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.890> pull<00:01:35.189> movement<00:01:35.700> but

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
doing this push and pull movement but

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.929 
doing this push and pull movement but
also<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.960> lower<00:01:37.229> body<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.159> are<00:01:38.189> moving<00:01:38.490> one

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
exercise for working one glute at a time
if<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.390> exercise<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.810> works<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
if we do an exercise that works to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
if we do an exercise that works to
glutes<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> same<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.180> then

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
glutes at the time at the same time then

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
glutes at the time at the same time then
that<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.290> excellent<00:01:55.530> exercise<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.340> not

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that is an excellent exercise but not

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
that is an excellent exercise but not
necessarily<00:01:57.149> excellent<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.079> teaching<00:01:58.530> us<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
necessarily excellent for teaching us to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.550 
necessarily excellent for teaching us to
be<00:01:59.130> better<00:01:59.399> runners<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.840> necessarily

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
be better runners not it not necessarily

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160 
be better runners not it not necessarily
excellent<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.189> us<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.640> learn<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> use

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
excellent for us to learn how to use

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.980 
excellent for us to learn how to use
that<00:02:04.979> glute<00:02:05.340> how<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.420> whole<00:02:06.719> body

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that glute how to use that whole body

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.359 
that glute how to use that whole body
through<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> running<00:02:07.890> movement

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
through a running movement

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
through a running movement
again<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> low<00:02:10.170> back<00:02:10.409> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
again you can see that the low back is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
again you can see that the low back is
straight<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.659> right<00:02:12.930> foot

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
straight and if we have the right foot

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.199 
straight and if we have the right foot
forward<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.159> are<00:02:14.280> leaning<00:02:14.580> forward<00:02:15.060> with

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
forward that we are leaning forward with

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.869 
forward that we are leaning forward with
the<00:02:15.299> left<00:02:15.510> hand<00:02:15.810> also<00:02:16.680> note<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> back<00:02:17.580> toe

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
the left hand also note the back toe

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.210 
the left hand also note the back toe
position<00:02:18.230> currently<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.560> ninety<00:02:20.040> five

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
position currently we have ninety five

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.059 
position currently we have ninety five
percent<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.879> our<00:02:21.000> weight<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.049> front<00:02:22.290> foot

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
percent of our weight on the front foot

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.009 
percent of our weight on the front foot
spread<00:02:24.000> evenly<00:02:24.269> throughout<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.659> foot

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
spread evenly throughout the foot

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.660 
spread evenly throughout the foot
keeping<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> back<00:02:25.739> straight<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:26.250> still<00:02:26.489> have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
keeping the back straight we still have

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.539 
keeping the back straight we still have
rotation<00:02:27.239> through<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> upper<00:02:27.659> body<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
rotation through the upper body and

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.059 
rotation through the upper body and
there<00:02:29.549> are<00:02:29.760> three<00:02:30.150> exercises<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:31.110> again

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
there are three exercises there again

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.309 
there are three exercises there again
breaking<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.819> upper<00:02:33.209> body<00:02:33.360> into<00:02:33.659> a<00:02:33.720> pull<00:02:34.049> or

breaking the upper body into a pull or

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.559 
breaking the upper body into a pull or
push<00:02:34.379> movement<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.579> help<00:02:35.760> our<00:02:35.879> upper<00:02:36.180> body<00:02:36.390> to

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
push movement to help our upper body to

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 
push movement to help our upper body to
propel<00:02:36.930> our<00:02:37.110> body<00:02:37.290> forward<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.340> also<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
propel our body forward but also to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.240 
propel our body forward but also to
isolate<00:02:39.329> one<00:02:39.540> glued<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.019> time<00:02:40.230> will<00:02:40.859> really

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
isolate one glued at a time will really

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
isolate one glued at a time will really
help<00:02:41.549> us<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.060> better<00:02:42.299> running<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.440> be
