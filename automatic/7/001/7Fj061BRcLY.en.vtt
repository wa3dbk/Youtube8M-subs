00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 God 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640
 two 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.230
 three months ago a video went up to the channel 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.029
 on preparing the oil 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.180
 kings is that it is an oil destined to 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.739
 high magic to spirituality and 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.350
 positive devotions and today I want 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.570
 tell them so you can use 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 because it is a very effective oil if 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.320
 you review that video you will see that the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.690
 ingredients that are used to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.470
 prepare the olÃ© herd have a strong 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 spiritual symbology and here I already have the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.420
 bottle one of them because preparations 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.609
 finished I have not cast it because I do not 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.670
 I'm going to use at the moment but the other one 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.379
 that I've passed it to a smaller one for 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.199
 that is more practical when it comes to 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.570
 do the functions is done to 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.309
 multitude of rituals of high magic of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.050
 spirituality of blessing of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.300
 consecration 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.340
 and it's a very special appointment in the first 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.160
 place serves to unite us 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 themselves after doing the devotions and 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.530
 the prayers you have to remember that the oil 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.440
 in itself represents ' the where the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.360
 wise spirit the anointing that already from the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.360
 ancient world used priests 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.880
 and the kings to consecrate themselves in all 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.280
 the cultures and peoples the consecration 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.410
 as much of a king as we have priest or 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 priestess was made through the anointing 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.850
 of the oil that represents the gift of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.550
 wise spirit the grace of being and of 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.010
 great spirit 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.840
 then it is used to drive us 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.180
 after doing the devotions we can 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.880
 join hands the heart the forehead 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.950
 after doing the prayers because the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
 oil will maintain that latent energy in 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 our body also used to 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.800
 refer you home we can take some 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.230
 drops of oil and draw a symbol 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.030
 important to us according to our 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.910
 faith in what doors and windows are 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.490
 of our house if you are Christians the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.979
 cross if you are pagans the pentacle or the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.690
 pentagram depends on the religion that 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.940
 practice you can use those 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.890
 symbols that you feel affinity and devotion 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.290
 It can also be used to add 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.670
 a few drops to the lamps that go 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.550
 intended for the blessing of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 companies of important projects or 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.080
 also for the offerings to the deceased 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.510
 considering that soon it will be the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.790
 magic night of samhain is good to tell 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.460
 with tools that help us honor 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.990
 to the ancestors you can also 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.780
 use to add a few drops 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.240
 in the bathroom water when we need 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.490
 the divine grace to continue with 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.990
 our work or when our spirits 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.970
 of falling sometimes we find ourselves 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.810
 fallen we need a push to 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.490
 continue with our search 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.440
 spiritual then the oil of the kings 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.910
 it serves for that I use it 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 especially for matters 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.620
 spiritual but also serves to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.120
 give the divine touch in those 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.040
 projects of utmost importance to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.780
 us if for example you receive a 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.910
 commissioned by a businessman who is going to assemble 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.100
 a company and that company is going to give 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.380
 I work with a lot of people and it's a 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.210
 project for the common good because I think 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.250
 that is fine and you have to have your 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.200
 help for that project to be directed 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.390
 towards the light and go well and get the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
 victory you can also use it to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.770
 say magical tools for example 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.690
 if you just bought a cauldron or 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.360
 one too and you want to consecrate 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.670
 you can give it the final touch by anointing it 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.710
 with the oil and invoking the wise 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.650
 spirit 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.220
 another way of use is to join 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.980
 candles 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.040
 that is, it serves to dress or consecrated 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.510
 candles praying over them while we go 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.360
 walking with him if you want to protect a 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 person who is in far away a 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.380
 son a loved one who needs 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.920
 protection you can also catch your 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.050
 photograph and anoint it with the oil of 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.150
 the remaining kings for that person 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.280
 dear asking for protection for your 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.770
 body your mind and your life 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.660
 equally serves to protect the 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.150
 children of the evil eye and negativity 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.069
 just take a little oil and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.870
 give him the blessing on the forehead or in the 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.430
 baby's head and leave it on 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.650
 because it is not toxic will bring 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.319
 blessings and protection reinforcing his 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.350
 aura 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.030
 This type of oil should not be added 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.430
 for example, water scrubbing the floor 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.900
 it is not used that way it is used 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.580
 for touch that is or for rituals but 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.199
 never add to the water that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.360
 they deliver the soil because the energy 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.509
 negative has weight tends to fall and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.220
 it's like adulterating a holy oil and 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.220
 It would be a pity to waste it that way 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.780
 this afternoon for example I have to 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.190
 bless a company and I will use a 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.660
 little bit of the oil of the kings for 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.690
 do the ritual so that work 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.820
 go well and be successful I wanted 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.440
 share with you the formulas and 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.419
 how to use it because I know you have 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.270
 many doubts about the use of 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.830
 the oils I keep it as is 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.410
 the shelf where I keep all the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.169
 products it is best that you do not give the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.610
 sun so you do not lose property you do not 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.919
 will use to ingest thereby 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.750
 the oil can last for years and years and years 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.800
 always with that power you do not have 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.479
 problems to find the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.249
 you can look for them in the 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.509
 esoteric stores or online 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.299
 it is true that it is a little oil 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.369
 elevated is expensive but how are they used 

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:19.959
 minimum quantities once what 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:22.029
 we have prepared that we have it in 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:24.419
 we could use our power and 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:27.699
 we will check the holy results 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.859
 I hope you use it and see you in the 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.859
 next video until soon
