00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.450
 star wars iii and is professor ii 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.059
 I know that winter is already more than 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 in the middle but still could not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.059
 stop passing sectoral to you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 today will teach what you have done 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.260
 Princess ear protector lÃ©ia this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 tutorial is very cheap and is super 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 easy then we will use yao the materials 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 necessary are there in the brown color I 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.159
 I chose Style 7 because it has a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.050
 very characteristic gloss hair a 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.940
 hair file you have chosen 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.519
 I found this cloth covered in color 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.929
 brown and felt also in brown and 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.449
 today when exercised for wanting well 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.969
 Toto, sweetheart, and to put it all together 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.680
 We're going to use hot glue and scissors. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.180
 first of all you'll have to measure 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 more or less the size you are going to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.659
 want your ear protector 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.220
 after I chose the size I 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.130
 I wanted to find a round container 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 to be able to mold 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.159
 now you will use this template to 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.579
 make four circles on your filter 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.579
 Brown 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.790
 to do the hair we will start 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.010
 to undo a ball of wool 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.080
 then you will cut the cold front of two 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.540
 meters and join us and do this two 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.160
 Sometimes do not forget to tie the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.510
 dots not to be releasing the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.510
 brand has with a piece of wool 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 then you will join the two parts of 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.780
 20 did so'll be 40 when his son 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.130
 instead of you make two and twenty you can 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.130
 make one of 40 also 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.700
 now it's very easy you'll get a 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.110
 of your felt circles and will 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.820
 put hot glue on it 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.200
 There you go and get a little yarn. 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.200
 dahlane paste right in the middle 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.480
 then it's only you start rolling up lan 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.970
 to make it into a bun wraps 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.260
 well strong alan makes it take off that 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 It's safe to paste 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.910
 it's just you repeating this process until 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.910
 finish all your movie 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.020
 when you 've already finished your body 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.209
 that you wrap up a little more and 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.569
 ties both fingers after visiting 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.569
 Tokyo 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.289
 cuts off excess wool and binds 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.650
 because we're going to use it for another 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.650
 ear 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.069
 Now we're going to finish colonizing the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.479
 pointing at the back 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.479
 I think it will be well finished 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.500
 you repeat the same process as the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.570
 other side 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 now we're going to use those two 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.160
 filters left over to make the 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.160
 finishing 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.920
 To start, we'll paste it here. 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.780
 coke is enough to get enough hot glue 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.110
 see a spot that you want 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.110
 he stays 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.190
 now to give the finish do not stay 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.110
 flatter your ear you will roll 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.090
 another filter part is just passing 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.840
 enough hot glue and after putting 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.840
 in your tranquil 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.300
 now I'm just going to repeat the same process 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.710
 the other side is ready our protector 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.710

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.270
