00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
princess takes place so maybe the Giroud

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.610 
speculation to that one I wouldn't be
upset<00:03:33.489> if<00:03:34.299> Nintendo<00:03:34.989> said<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.410> they<00:03:35.500> were

upset if Nintendo said that they were
going<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.799> make<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.040> mature<00:03:36.549> darker<00:03:37.709> scarier

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
going to make a mature darker scarier

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.970
