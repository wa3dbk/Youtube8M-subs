00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.270 

what<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.240> used<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:01.990> because<00:02:02.710> i<00:02:02.890> thought<00:02:03.100> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
what I used to do because i thought it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.950 
what I used to do because i thought it
was<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.670> will<00:02:03.820> save<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> little<00:02:04.300> bit<00:02:04.420> more<00:02:04.690> money

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
was it will save a little bit more money

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.810 
was it will save a little bit more money
without<00:02:05.229> i<00:02:05.470> don't<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.920> really<00:02:05.950> done<00:02:06.430> is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
without i don't think it really done is

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.980 
without i don't think it really done is
I<00:02:07.259> would<00:02:08.259> make<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.679> whole<00:02:09.039> bunch<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.630> iron<00:02:10.630> war

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
I would make a whole bunch of iron war

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.090 
I would make a whole bunch of iron war
accident<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:13.570> would<00:02:13.750> also<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.200> some<00:02:14.890> iron

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
accident and I would also make some iron

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.370 
accident and I would also make some iron
armor<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.209> figured<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.990> that<00:02:17.020> would

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
armor but I figured that that would

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.350 
armor but I figured that that would
