00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
second thing about it is there's more of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
second thing about it is there's more of
a<00:00:35.730> Juniper<00:00:36.120> presence<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.590> London<00:00:38.190> Dry

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
a Juniper presence in the London Dry

a Juniper presence in the London Dry
I've<00:00:38.820> never<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.510> considered<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.940> Bombay

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I've never really considered the Bombay

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
I've never really considered the Bombay
Sapphire<00:00:42.239> being<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> London<00:00:43.290> Dry<00:00:43.559> Gin<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
Sapphire being a London Dry Gin I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.760 
Sapphire being a London Dry Gin I
actually<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.809> botanicals<00:00:46.530> take

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
actually think that the botanicals take

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
actually think that the botanicals take
more<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.160> forward<00:00:48.770> center<00:00:49.770> stage<00:00:50.039> than<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
more of a forward center stage than the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850 
more of a forward center stage than the
Juniper<00:00:51.660> itself<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> other<00:00:52.710> thing

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Juniper itself and the other thing

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.260 
Juniper itself and the other thing
that's<00:00:53.010> different<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.910> these<00:00:53.969> guys

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that's different about two of these guys

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.290 
that's different about two of these guys
right<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> alcohol<00:00:55.770> by<00:00:55.920> volume

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
right here is that the alcohol by volume

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.639 
right here is that the alcohol by volume
what's<00:00:57.300> interesting<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> traditionally

what's interesting is a traditionally

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
what's interesting is a traditionally
