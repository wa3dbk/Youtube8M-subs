mathematics at a University of Exeter I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
mathematics at a University of Exeter I
was<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> always<00:00:35.550> interest<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
was because I always interest in the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.510 
was because I always interest in the
subjects<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.079> young<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.070> think

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
subjects when I was young and I think

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.569 
subjects when I was young and I think
the<00:00:38.610> subject<00:00:39.000> itself<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.989> helpful<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
the subject itself is really helpful to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.220 
the subject itself is really helpful to
all<00:00:41.579> sort<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> experts<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> career<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
all sort of experts all to career in the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
all sort of experts all to career in the
future<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.550> he<00:00:44.640> helps<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> develop

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
future and then he helps you to develop

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
future and then he helps you to develop
your<00:00:45.989> own<00:00:46.260> logic<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.770> reasoning<00:00:47.100> skill<00:00:47.399> and

your own logic or reasoning skill and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
your own logic or reasoning skill and
that's<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.420> handy<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.350> when<00:00:49.620> you're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

year to take a semester abroad I went to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.310 
year to take a semester abroad I went to
America<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.250> went<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.730> New<00:02:25.030> Mexico<00:02:25.320> Americans

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320

are<00:02:26.610> fantastic<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.850> also<00:02:28.270> had<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.570> opportunity

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
are fantastic I also had the opportunity

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.550 
are fantastic I also had the opportunity
to<00:02:29.260> study<00:02:29.560> some<00:02:30.750> different<00:02:31.750> modules<00:02:32.380> over

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
to study some different modules over

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.490 
to study some different modules over
there<00:02:32.890> which<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.280> couldn't<00:02:33.580> do<00:02:33.700> over<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.750> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
there which I couldn't do over here I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.280 
there which I couldn't do over here I
studied<00:02:36.310> some<00:02:36.520> music<00:02:36.940> as<00:02:37.180> well<00:02:37.480> as<00:02:37.630> doing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
studied some music as well as doing

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.600 
studied some music as well as doing
maths<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.800> same<00:02:38.980> time<00:02:39.220> which<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.580> really

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
maths at the same time which was really

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.370 
maths at the same time which was really
great<00:02:39.940> for<00:02:40.270> me<00:02:40.330> there<00:02:41.140> are<00:02:41.230> many

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
great for me there are many

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.080 
great for me there are many
