 tragic terrorist events so that has 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.280

 attacks in the Paris region since 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.090
 it concerns that the Paris region has 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 been very well done I want to grab this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.840
 opportunity to thank everyone 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 everyone had good behaviors 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 good vigilance reflexes 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 report those who today poses the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.689
 no problem is the packages 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.939
 suspects in vigipirate alert 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.250
 bombings a suspicious package is deemed 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.780
 dangerous and one understands measures 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.880
 maximum safety 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.979
 just last week 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.439
 represented a point and a half or two 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.360
 points of irregularity in Ile de France 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.039
 and so what must happen to do 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 pass as a message to those who are 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.979
 listen 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.970
 it is to be more vigilant than ever 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.010
 on the number 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.900
 ah we never take the risk 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.370
 to leave or to board a train there 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.020
 board of a county the counties and their 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.850
 account and because every time he 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
 is a suspicious package at the time it 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.100
 poses a lot of problems 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.440
 she also greets very concretely 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.940
 that we will have to get used to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 next days in the next few months 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.410
 to see more and more soldiers at 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.160
 within quarters it's normal it's for 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.530
 our security 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 yes as long as the plan alert bombing 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.070
 is not lifted we are in the situation 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.420
 we knew last week 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.580
 now what is true is that the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.070
 tension that was palpable the week 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.630
 last will I hope fallout each 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.260
 does his job all the measures have 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.990
 been taken 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.270
 so we must also continue to live 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.100
 find a little serenity 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.890
 but again in the vigilance 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.130
 So here are these sad events 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.050
 and of course we'll come back to sncf 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.610
 radio we go to the second part 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.610
 issues travelers' questions 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.480
 meet you with guillaume pépy surkis 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.220
 ncf radio with edwige responsible 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.720
 team leader with us in 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.000
 plateau we will listen to the first 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.239
 question hello sir pépy marielle 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.330
 50 years old I use a lot ter between 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.360
 Bellevue and Montparnasse and I am 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.600
 asks when the sncf will change so 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.070
 his train park including the old 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 gray train that breaks down very 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.830
 often then she is you on the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.709
 field you are informed 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.540
 yes actually so at monet a little 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.860
 my survey of managers of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.799
 means made to December 14 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.290
 so that corresponds to our change 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.849
 winter service half of 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.700
 small gray in quotation marks 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.280
 5300 aid was replaced by 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.810
 double level oars actually it takes 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.079
 now we will leave time to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.500
 time and normally it should not 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.170
 more see little gray on July 12 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.849
 okay so I wanted to confirm the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.730
 oars will be replaced so edwige 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.409
 said it's true and so is 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 these oars seram stainless steel 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.670
 they date from 1968 70 so they have 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.680
 widely done their time they are 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.690
 completely obsolete and like edwige 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.430
 said it and there are trains with stages 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.889
 who will replace them non curat 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.270
 a lot more seating then we 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.820
 is a little sorry because these are 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.500
 among the last trains we call 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.000
 the little gray here but we must 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.759
 that it falls on someone and it was 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.800
 its links on line n enter 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.380
 especially versailles and paris which 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.970
 was a pity here are two steps and that 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.320
 disappears in July was worth the second 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.550
 question I sent you the book was sent 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.199
 by but I would like to ask you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.710
 several questions the first so 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.630
 why remove trains 450 and 450 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.820
 r the question and clarifies berlin paris 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.050
 paris berlin operations of the deutsche 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.490
 bahn i cross it concerns us 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.720
 finally where does it relate to hadj bah no 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.159
 it does not concern us what these 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.750
 trains were going to paris but these are 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.720
 German trains that was operated by 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.849
 our German colleagues we ourselves 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.590
 obviously assured the attraction this is to 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.669
 say that we were ensuring the locomotive but 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.130
 they were trains of the deutsche bahn 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.550
 deutsche bahn decided to remove them from 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.130
 service 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.599
 it must be said that between berlin and paris the 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.849
 rail traffic had a lot 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.919
 much dropped 1 and a lot of traffic 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.120
 with low cost airlines 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.650
 and this night train was 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.490
 unfortunately uncrowded so yes 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.380
 we regret that but here are the times 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.880
 have changed the second question the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.110
 railway photography and maybe 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.490
 ok or not good question 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.440
 finally said you often see you 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.810
 people take pictures of trains from 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.610
 travelers yes no if we can we can not 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.050
 there is a tolerance anyway so he 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.130
 there is no problem then at this level 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.880
 there is no longer contains 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.680
 professional 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.419
 we're not going to transition this 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.920
 difference to take a picture for yourself 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.390
 and make a report 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.030
 precisely they can put themselves in 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.480
 danger on in the train stations with their 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.100
 perch or too close to the edge of the track 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.530
 and there could be accidents 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.360
 it's like that guillon is called the 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.140
 press service 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.760
 yes when we want to ask for a 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.320
 permission to appeal in shooting 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.600
 for example press service but 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.070
 edwige is right to say that you have to 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.510
 be careful because the 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.830
 personal photographs obviously 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.420
 everyone knows what he wants but the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.710
 professional photography it's a 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.870
 little different at first there are often 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.250
 rights and then then there are a lot of 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.860
 people who take unnecessary risks 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.030
 by putting oneself in positions a little 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.130
 So dangerous is also our 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.810
 having to make sure that happens 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.250
 not in a dangerous way so we 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.290
 watch it very closely so here 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.490
 for this show of those to Monday 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.770
