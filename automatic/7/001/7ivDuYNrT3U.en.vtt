00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 mass consistency which is what it had 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.020
 to be first then not first this

 we own rice flour with milk 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.100
 cow now without water because with cinnamon 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.860
 carries 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 clear flan egg yolk butter 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.890
 ideal that is a white butter that does not 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 comes to taste 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 because with margarine that throws it forced 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.910
 to what 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.610
 already when the dough is cooked as 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.460
 for a blank handle to give a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.510
 texture well 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.540

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.560
 this type of topics 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.920
 35 years ok friends here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.230

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.080
 commissions our compatriots that if I 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.570
 I have a lot of customers and the address is 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.290

 we grabbed more than what is 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 because it measures the measurement 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:32.530
