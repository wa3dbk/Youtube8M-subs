technology<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> helmet<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.159> Marc<00:01:09.030> was

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
technology as the helmet does Marc was

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
technology as the helmet does Marc was
putting<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:10.409> layer<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.920> map<00:01:11.549> from

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
putting in one layer of map from

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
putting in one layer of map from
underneath<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> normal<00:01:12.840> Sun<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.340> lot

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
underneath the normal Sun because a lot

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
underneath the normal Sun because a lot
of<00:01:14.610> injuries<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.299> facial<00:01:15.630> injuries<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of injuries are facial injuries so the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
of injuries are facial injuries so the
garden<00:01:18.090> fits<00:01:18.330> super<00:01:18.960> well<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> helmet

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
garden fits super well with the helmet

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
garden fits super well with the helmet
and<00:01:20.009> due<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> big<00:01:20.790> lens<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.720> still<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and due to the big lens you still have a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
and due to the big lens you still have a
very<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.590> vision<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.060> everything

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
very good vision and can see everything

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I want to minimise the risk as welding

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260 
I want to minimise the risk as welding
is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:27.900> dangerous<00:01:28.140> sport<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.240> yeah<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
equipment is really light with the map

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
equipment is really light with the map
technology<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.850> gives<00:01:39.150> me<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.479> good

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
