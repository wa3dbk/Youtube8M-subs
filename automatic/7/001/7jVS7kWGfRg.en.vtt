know all the details yet it's going to
be<00:00:12.480> investigated<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.549> why<00:00:14.790> we

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
be investigated but this is why we

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480 
be investigated but this is why we
passed<00:00:15.389> Wall<00:00:15.960> Street<00:00:16.260> Reform<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.250> whole

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
point was even if you're smart you can

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
point was even if you're smart you can
make<00:00:22.680> mistakes<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.510> since<00:00:24.510> these<00:00:24.689> banks<00:00:25.109> are

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
make mistakes and since these banks are

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.560 
make mistakes and since these banks are
insured<00:00:26.269> backed<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.570> by<00:00:28.050> taxpayers<00:00:29.330> we<00:00:30.330> don't

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
insured backed up by taxpayers we don't

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.950 
insured backed up by taxpayers we don't
want<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.050> taking<00:00:32.009> risks<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:33.510> eventually

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
want you taking risks where eventually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
want you taking risks where eventually
we<00:00:34.590> might<00:00:34.770> end<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.160> having<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.760> bail<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> out

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
we might end up having to bail you out

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
we might end up having to bail you out
again<00:00:36.350> because<00:00:37.350> we've<00:00:37.530> done<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.890> been<00:00:38.460> there

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
again because we've done that been there

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.540 
again because we've done that been there
didn't<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.890> why<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.370> raise

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
didn't like it so this is why we raise

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
didn't like it so this is why we raise
capital<00:00:42.090> requirements<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.379> they

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
capital requirements so that when they

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
capital requirements so that when they
do<00:00:43.559> lose<00:00:44.070> money<00:00:44.340> they've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.180> enough<00:00:45.450> money

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
do lose money they've got enough money

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
do lose money they've got enough money
socked<00:00:45.989> away<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> pay<00:00:47.250> off<00:00:47.430> those

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
socked away that they can pay off those

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600 
socked away that they can pay off those
obligations<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> why<00:00:49.890> we've<00:00:50.280> put<00:00:50.520> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
obligations this is why we've put in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
obligations this is why we've put in
place<00:00:50.930> something<00:00:51.930> called<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> Volcker<00:00:52.530> rule

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
place something called the Volcker rule

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.110 
place something called the Volcker rule
that<00:00:53.129> says<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.710> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
that says you know what if you are a
