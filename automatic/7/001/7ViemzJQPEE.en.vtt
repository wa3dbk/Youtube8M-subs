looking for the pressuring it's okay
you're<00:01:12.330> switching<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.200> bank<00:01:13.470> angle<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.400> 25

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
you're switching the bank angle to 25

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.859 
you're switching the bank angle to 25

auntie eyes we let we just let it go let

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.890 
auntie eyes we let we just let it go let
it<00:02:57.930> run

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.440 

but<00:03:01.439> we're<00:03:01.620> switching<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.159> APU<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.760> first<00:03:03.209> we

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
but we're switching the APU of first we

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.710 
but we're switching the APU of first we
took<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.590> from<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.610> bus<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.970> disconnect<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
took it from the bus we disconnect the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.100 
took it from the bus we disconnect the
APU<00:03:07.110> from<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> bus<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.629> then<00:03:09.629> we<00:03:09.840> switch<00:03:10.079> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
APU from the bus and then we switch to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:21.650 
APU from the bus and then we switch to
help<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.280> view<00:03:12.090> of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.960 

and<00:03:22.080> in<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.500> configuration<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:26.400> manage<00:03:26.730> our

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and in this configuration we manage our

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.680 
and in this configuration we manage our
clock

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
clock

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.910 
clock
so<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.620> here<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.550> can<00:03:30.820> swap<00:03:31.330> this

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
so just here you see you can swap this

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.330 
so just here you see you can swap this
information<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.160> left<00:03:33.670> side<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:36.190> don't

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
information to the left side we don't

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.170 
information to the left side we don't
need<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.820> pew<00:03:37.650> page<00:03:38.650> anymore<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:39.790> go<00:03:39.940> for

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
need to a pew page anymore and we go for

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.270 
need to a pew page anymore and we go for
the<00:03:40.330> system<00:03:40.750> page<00:03:41.020> this<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.350> ours<00:03:41.770> are

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the system page this is ours are

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.760 
the system page this is ours are
warnings<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:45.330> if<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.510> just<00:03:46.900> press<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.500> and

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
hold it you can see all the warnings if

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.020 
hold it you can see all the warnings if
you<00:03:50.980> let<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.430> go<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.840> mouse<00:03:53.580> you'll<00:03:54.580> see<00:03:54.820> that

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
you let it go the mouse you'll see that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.480 
you let it go the mouse you'll see that
there<00:03:55.300> is<00:03:55.480> actually<00:03:55.750> no<00:03:56.680> warning<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.400> the

there is actually no warning in the
moment<00:03:58.620> pressing<00:03:59.620> here's<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.890> one<00:04:00.220> test<00:04:00.700> button

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
moment pressing here's a one test button

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.710 
moment pressing here's a one test button
it's<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.290> standby<00:04:02.680> warning<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:03.520> warning<00:04:04.300> gotta

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
it's a standby warning but warning gotta

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.530 
it's a standby warning but warning gotta
know<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:07.120> you're<00:04:07.360> pressing<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.930> sketches<00:04:09.540> you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
know if you're pressing the sketches you

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:20.650 
know if you're pressing the sketches you
see<00:04:10.810> some<00:04:11.050> information

I<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:24.040> enough<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.400> understand

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
I think this is enough to understand

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.020 
I think this is enough to understand

my advice is just follows a c-list to
the<00:04:37.580> checklist<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.360> put<00:04:38.630> in<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.650> plane<00:04:41.860> then

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the checklist I put in to the plane then

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.240 
the checklist I put in to the plane then
you<00:04:43.040> will<00:04:43.250> have<00:04:43.390> no<00:04:44.390> problem<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:45.740> understand

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
you will have no problem to understand
