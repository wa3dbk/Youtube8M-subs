although<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.360> still<00:01:18.570> feel<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> there's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
areas that what we consider viable or

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.780 
areas that what we consider viable or
maybe<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.540> likelihood<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.520> hard<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
maybe a likelihood it's just so hard to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
maybe a likelihood it's just so hard to
say<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> tremendous<00:01:24.479> blast<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> energy

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
say with the tremendous blast and energy

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
say with the tremendous blast and energy
if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.369> somebody<00:01:26.700> could<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> survived

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
if you know somebody could have survived

if you know somebody could have survived
that<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> areas<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.680> looking<00:01:28.799> at

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
that in the areas that we're looking at

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.010 
that in the areas that we're looking at
so<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.460> are<00:01:31.610> all<00:01:31.760> bracing<00:01:32.299> ourselves<00:01:32.479> for<00:01:32.990> a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
so we are all bracing ourselves for a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410 
so we are all bracing ourselves for a
long<00:01:33.380> search<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.070> rescue<00:01:34.520> one<00:01:34.760> estimate<00:01:35.210> with

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
long search and rescue one estimate with

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.240 
long search and rescue one estimate with
anywhere<00:01:35.869> between<00:01:36.020> three<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.440> six<00:01:36.740> days<00:01:37.040> but

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
anywhere between three and six days but

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.490 
anywhere between three and six days but
clearly<00:01:37.670> could<00:01:37.880> go<00:01:38.030> longer<00:01:38.240> than<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:39.170> is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
clearly could go longer than that it is

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.140 
clearly could go longer than that it is
painful<00:01:39.800> for<00:01:40.070> everyone<00:01:40.760> in<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.090> country

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
painful for everyone in this country

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.810 
painful for everyone in this country
today<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:41.990> probably<00:01:42.170> most<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.070> for<00:01:43.640> people

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
today but probably most so for people

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.969 
today but probably most so for people
who<00:01:43.970> have<00:01:44.360> family<00:01:44.930> inside<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.560> building
