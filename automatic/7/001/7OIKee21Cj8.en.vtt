 Text © Janas Bogumił October 2013 r. I cordially greet you 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.300
 culinary videos. Today we will be working on the subject 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.060
 preserves. Today, we put peppers in the jar 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.680
 colorful. It will be useful for us in winter-when. 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.240
 prices will go up. It will be nice to open it yourself 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.940
 made a jar with peppers. Necessary ingredients for about 15 jars from 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
 900-600 g. Peppers different colors about 5000 g. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.380
 As we like spicy flavors, we can add a little colorful chili peppers - by gulp 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.540
 when working on the eyes and other parts of the body, make sure you do not 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.640
 fade-up the peppers are very hot. 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.650
 Spices Salt, black and white charlock, 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.800
 coriander, black or colorful pepper in the beans, 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.690
 bay leaf, allspice. About 1000 g of onion. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.500
 Wash and clean the pepper-seeds rinsed under running water-cut in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000
 quarters or eights or, if you prefer, onions too 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.830
 wash, peel and cut with a knife or grater slices, slices 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.910
 , discs. NOTE- WE WILL CARE FOR PURPOSE CHILI 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.710
 CONSIDERING ITS CHARACTER PROPERTIES. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:15.520
 Sprinkle the spices evenly into the jars 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 with the exception of salt, which we will use to make a pickle. 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 We boil the pepper, burn, blanch 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.590
 then more and better it can be put in 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.980
 to the jar. The jars should be checked if the nuts are 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.660
 good and tight - pouring a little water into the jar, wringing 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.360
 and after tilting up, nothing should flow from the jar. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.050
 We really have to check it out to avoid it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.190
 losses due to leakage of the jars - they will simply break down. 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:57.980
 We blanche the peppers - we set the water on the brine with salt. 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.430
 Put each jar on a little crushed onion. 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:17.110
 We can put in as much as we want because they are our homemade products and nobody else 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:25.310
 he will not forbid it yet. If we decided on chili peppers 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.460
 it's CAUTION WE DO WE DARE ON PIECES AND PLACE 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.640
 IN SLOVAKS-ALWAYS BEING CAREFUL NOT TO STICK 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.360
 THROUGH NO EYES OF EYES OR OTHER SENSITIVE BODY PARTS - IT IS 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.200
 VERY PAINFUL. Mr. Boguś, something is up to you again 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.370
 shrimp - this pepper will always shrink during cooking. 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.880
 If the pepper is slightly softer, we pour water and let it cool down. 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.140
 Place the cooled paprika, load, pack into jars. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.250
 There are products that shrink like, for example, cooked with paprika and also 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:04.750
 sausages with the addition of soy that swells. Ha Ha. 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.730
 We load our scalded, boiled peppers into the jar. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.600
 And we planted something very shriveled into the jar - it's a colorful pepper. 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:31.290
 dub something fell. Pour the jars boiled with salty pickle 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.600
 so that it covers the peppers. We screw it up and put it in pots 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.580
 on a grid or lined with a cloth so that the jars do not have direct contact with 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.990
 vessel. We cook pasteurise a minimum of 30 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.020
 minutes. Ready our peppers in a jar for the winter or 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.860
 other occasions. I received 15 jars of peppers from 5 kg of peppers. 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:28.580
 I used about 5 liters of water for the pickle. Thank you for your attention - it was nice to me virtually 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.050
 stay with you at home. Thank you for your attention and invite you 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.720
 for my other culinary films. Filmykulinarne. 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.900
