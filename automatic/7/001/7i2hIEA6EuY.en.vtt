00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
so frigid cold outside and we don't

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.240 
so frigid cold outside and we don't
currently<00:00:06.779> have<00:00:06.960> heat<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.470> garage<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
currently have heat in the garage and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.540 
currently have heat in the garage and
I'm<00:00:08.849> not<00:00:09.150> gonna<00:00:09.650> stand<00:00:10.650> outside<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.400> my

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
I'm not gonna stand outside with my

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.249 
I'm not gonna stand outside with my
skinny<00:00:11.940> rear-end<00:00:12.360> out<00:00:12.540> there<00:00:12.719> freezing<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
skinny rear-end out there freezing to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.460 
skinny rear-end out there freezing to
death<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.089> figured<00:00:15.089> now<00:00:15.210> it'd<00:00:15.269> be<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.809> good

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
death so I figured now it'd be a good

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.630 
death so I figured now it'd be a good
time<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.580> ahead<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.940> take<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> transmission

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
time to go ahead and take a transmission

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.300 
time to go ahead and take a transmission
700<00:00:20.640> series<00:00:20.910> peerless<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.680> will<00:00:22.830> prep<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
700 series peerless and we will prep it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.029 
700 series peerless and we will prep it
for<00:00:23.340> racing

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
for racing

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
for racing
so<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.369> escape<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> basement<00:00:27.720> where<00:00:28.080> it's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
so I escape to the basement where it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
so I escape to the basement where it's
much<00:00:28.500> much<00:00:28.980> warmer<00:00:31.309> first<00:00:32.309> off<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
much much warmer first off which is you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.010 
much much warmer first off which is you
can<00:00:33.420> tell<00:00:33.600> I've<00:00:33.690> already<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.320> apart

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
can tell I've already had this one apart

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
can tell I've already had this one apart
you<00:00:37.020> take<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> six<00:00:37.680> bolts<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.629> hold<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> on

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
you take the six bolts out hold it on
make<00:00:40.200> sure<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.469> save<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> I've<00:00:41.670> got

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
make sure you save them and I've got

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.319 
make sure you save them and I've got
them<00:00:42.180> somewhere<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> garage<00:00:43.940> one<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
them somewhere in the garage one and you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.459 
them somewhere in the garage one and you
get<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.800> case<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.760> top<00:00:47.969> case<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:51.469> these

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
get this case off the top case now these

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.410 
get this case off the top case now these
transmissions<00:00:53.309> come<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> reverse<00:00:54.239> chain

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
transmissions come with a reverse chain

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
transmissions come with a reverse chain
there<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.050> big<00:00:58.620> debate<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> whether<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there is a big debate on whether you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
there is a big debate on whether you
should<00:01:00.500> run<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.760> run<00:01:02.760> without<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:04.040> my<00:01:05.040> thing<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
should run it run without it my thing is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
should run it run without it my thing is
I<00:01:05.939> run<00:01:06.780> without<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.920> reason<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.930> not

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I run without it the reason is it's not

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.850 
I run without it the reason is it's not
a<00:01:10.170> question<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.920> whether<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:12.270> it'll<00:01:12.659> break<00:01:12.990> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a question of whether if it'll break but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.490 
a question of whether if it'll break but
win<00:01:14.479> can<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:16.020> now

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
win can I get a right now

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.789 
win can I get a right now
if<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.130> chain<00:01:17.430> breaks<00:01:18.530> parts<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.650> pieces

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
if this chain breaks parts and pieces

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.660 
if this chain breaks parts and pieces
get<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
get in here

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
get in here
guess<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:22.310> forty<00:01:23.310> miles<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:23.729> hour<00:01:24.170> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
guess what forty miles an hour that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
guess what forty miles an hour that
transmission<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> done<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> will

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
transmission is done and it will

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
transmission is done and it will
probably<00:01:27.659> throw<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:28.080> ass<00:01:28.110> over<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
probably throw your ass over the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.010 
probably throw your ass over the
steering<00:01:29.009> wheel

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
steering wheel

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
steering wheel
so<00:01:31.020> better<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.220> safe<00:01:32.460> than<00:01:32.520> sorry

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so better to be safe than sorry

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.450 
so better to be safe than sorry

this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> shifter<00:01:39.210> fork<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:42.390> goes<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.780> like

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
this is a shifter fork it goes in like

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.240 
this is a shifter fork it goes in like
yet<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.790> grease<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.500> pack<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
yet the grease that they pack into this

thing
it's<00:01:47.880> called<00:01:48.149> bentonite<00:01:48.659> grease<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
it's called bentonite grease it is

off<00:01:56.600> I've<00:01:57.600> had<00:01:57.780> people<00:01:57.930> say<00:01:58.110> they've<00:01:58.469> used

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
off I've had people say they've used

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.859 
off I've had people say they've used
gasoline<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.729> clean<00:01:59.969> them<00:02:00.090> real<00:02:00.299> well<00:02:00.509> they've

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
make sure they're all brass if you see

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.670 
make sure they're all brass if you see
them<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:10.870> they're<00:05:11.380> silver<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.610> all<00:05:13.000> shiny

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
that is the the metal replacement these

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.900 
that is the the metal replacement these

bushings<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.110> them<00:05:29.920> are<00:05:30.130> not<00:05:30.370> good

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
bushings in it and them are not good

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.880 
bushings in it and them are not good
good<00:05:31.840> for<00:05:32.820> factory<00:05:33.820> speeds<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:35.260> when<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:35.650> try

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
good for factory speeds but when you try

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.310 
good for factory speeds but when you try
to<00:05:35.950> overdrive<00:05:36.550> them<00:05:36.760> like<00:05:36.910> we<00:05:37.150> do<00:05:37.330> it'll<00:05:38.110> just

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
to overdrive them like we do it'll just

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.380 
to overdrive them like we do it'll just
end<00:05:38.590> up<00:05:38.800> seizing<00:05:39.310> them<00:05:39.430> onto<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.790> shaft<00:05:40.060> and

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
end up seizing them onto the shaft and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.110 
end up seizing them onto the shaft and
you'll<00:05:40.540> just<00:05:40.660> have<00:05:41.470> all<00:05:41.620> kinds<00:05:41.950> of<00:05:42.010> issues<00:05:42.130> so

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
you'll just have all kinds of issues so

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.220 
you'll just have all kinds of issues so
it's<00:05:43.240> best<00:05:43.480> to<00:05:43.630> find<00:05:43.960> one<00:05:44.200> that<00:05:44.950> has<00:05:45.480> all<00:05:46.480> four

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
it's best to find one that has all four

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.310 
it's best to find one that has all four
of<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.770> brass<00:05:48.010> bushings<00:05:48.990> put<00:05:49.990> them<00:05:50.140> off<00:05:50.290> to

of the brass bushings put them off to

of the brass bushings put them off to
the<00:05:50.500> side<00:05:50.530> just<00:05:51.370> wipe<00:05:51.670> them<00:05:51.850> down<00:05:51.970> clean<00:05:52.330> them

this break I know it's very tempting to

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
it what else we got here when you go to

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.440 
it what else we got here when you go to
take<00:06:58.810> these<00:06:59.020> apart<00:06:59.760> try<00:07:00.760> to<00:07:00.820> keep<00:07:01.060> them<00:07:01.240> in

take these apart try to keep them in

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
order that way you can put them back in

number teeth or at least close to it I

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.480 
number teeth or at least close to it I
mean<00:07:13.300> it's<00:07:13.450> pretty<00:07:14.380> hard<00:07:14.800> to<00:07:14.980> mix<00:07:15.160> them<00:07:15.340> up

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
mean it's pretty hard to mix them up

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.520 
mean it's pretty hard to mix them up
because<00:07:16.000> there's<00:07:16.420> only<00:07:16.540> one<00:07:16.840> way<00:07:17.140> that<00:07:17.380> they

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
because there's only one way that they

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.960 
because there's only one way that they
go<00:07:17.710> on<00:07:18.840> they<00:07:19.840> only<00:07:19.990> fit<00:07:20.380> a<00:07:20.410> certain<00:07:20.890> way<00:07:21.100> and<00:07:21.700> if
