 publication of the manga the hour of truth 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.849
 approach 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.410
 a whole piece of the history of the road 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.360

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.739
 ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.090
 and everyone that hysen how 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.950
 are you going but nakama for my part I 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.870
 will be well, because today 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.670
 we end up for a video that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.740
 I hope you will be pleased and that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 especially you did not expect it in 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.910
 same time I post them on facebook 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.470
 I left some clues here by 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.200
 there but at my greatest grief 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.670
 not many people have seen it if you have 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.260
 including the link to the title and the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.700
 thumbnail of this video is so much 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 better because today we are going to cause 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.260
 last naruto last 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 so here you go tell me but wait 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 aizen how did you do to see him there 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.810
 did not even come out in vostfr 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 and well think again and before you have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 a big wave of questions like 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
 what is the site to see it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 let me answer you for those who 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 would have seen it on my facebook I am 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.490
 went to see naruto the last at the cinema and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.479
 yes it can make you want like that but 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 not completely 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.229
 then certainly going to see a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.270
 naruto at the cinema is super fun 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.190
 I was even super excited but I have a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 to say to those who expect the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.670
 movie with impatience 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.050
 do not expect too much from this movie 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 maybe surprise you but I do not 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 decortic would not have the film as I 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 did it in my long video on the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 naruto end shippuuden because everything 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.330
 I simply reserve this kind of format 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.679
 for better opportunities and who 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.390
 since I went to see the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.310
 movie at least a week ago 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.720
 I will forget many things that have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250
 cringe when I have them 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 seen no what am I going to do earlier 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.400
 it's giving you my overall opinion and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.760
 try not to get into the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 details 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.800
 for those who still have alive 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 in front of the short film we will start 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.670
 nicely naruto the last who like 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.380
 specified in the title as in its 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.570
 trailer is supposed to say well 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.940
 supposed to be the last story of 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.680
 naruto in movie is of course not 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.390
 I think you too do not believe it 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.310
 more than me then as you know 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.519
 this film has taken me a lot of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.320
 time 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.940
 since his announcement even the fact of 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.310
 review our protagonists several 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 years later was super attractive and 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.299
 when the same day I saw his exit at 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.739
 cinema I went straight down because 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.269
 although this movie about a disappointment 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.950
 the graphics and this admiration 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.320
 Children who holds you in the guts do 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.910
 is hardly achieved yes because if you go 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.950
 see the movie for the graphics and see 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.450
 a long at had naruto then you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.310
 will have chances as soon as possible but if you 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.110
 are a fan following closely every little 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.190
 partial of the manga and well you 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 find this endless session 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.780
 the animation as for it is very 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.519
 great quality we are entitled to a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.610
 intro in black and white of all beauty 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.569
 but is that enough really 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.099
 yet the content does not fail to 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.569
 the call since in this film it's the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.239
 clan youga who is honored and 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.769
 finally I want to say but then of 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.450
 what causes the son is well our 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.190
 protagonists live a life of the most 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.629
 calm since the fourth great war 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.310
 but that's without counting the fact that the 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.349
 moon is getting closer and closer to the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.329
 earth what is abnormal will you say to me 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.420
 and yes because it's the new enemy of 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.769
 togneri movie otsuki who manages all this n 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.680
 enemies who capture the younger sister 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.109
 of hinata annabi to seize sebia 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.609
 coogan in the manner of uchiwa but you 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.099
 know more about his motives in 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.200
 watching the movie because to say true we 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.670
 brain already wanted to erase all that in 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.739
 big the film revolves around a 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.420
 love story between naruto and hinata 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.099
 and honestly I do not think I have 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.709
 never looked from norauto as soft as 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.239
 this the biggest problem of the film is 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.590
 that the villain maybe arrives a little 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.389
 too late in naruto history 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.400
 since we will not hide it 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.260
 end of the fourth great naruto war 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.519
 reaches a power stage so as to 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.310
 what no one else can 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.840
 stop so for 1:30 bite you 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.730
 the fingers to see him use the mode 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.919
 qbe that he also seems to have 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.109
 forgot all that to beat the enemy with 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.109
 yes yes it's true spoil alert 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.670
 where was I already ah yes to finish 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.630
 by beating him with a punch yes 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.460
 pretty much like that the characters are 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.140
 very well respected togneri has a 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.600
 certain class we will not hide it 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.010
 we finally see that to hide hokage but 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.690
 his role is almost useless 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.370
 unfortunately one of the things that 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.050
 annoys me the most it's good sasuke 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.820
 what does it mean and make it appear 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.340
 on the movie card is to do as much 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.140
 of pub around him for what we see 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.650
 of him in the movie as much make a 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.990
 surprise 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 with his 45 seconds of demonstration of 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.200
 chrono power in hand sasuke passes 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.440
 completely as characters 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.790
 pay your fan service corp 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.470
 is something that will tickle me all 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.130
 along the film and I hope not to be 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.200
 the only 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 these are the techniques not new well 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.890
 sure but a little updated 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.410
 we have the right to a rased shuriken 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.240
 version 1.2 to believe that the kenzan of 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.940
 scream one replaced this good old zen rat 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.940
 shuriken that changed color 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 inexplicably 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 Wait 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.810
 we will ignore the fact that the enemies 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.999
 balance all keekoa and that we 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.379
 have the right to machine guns from 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:13.270
 chakra shit even the last fight of the 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.639
 movie I had more the impression to see 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.259
 the last fukatsu of f that the last one 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.090
 dragon ball fight is that after two 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.699
 hours of film I do not know if it's good 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.289
 profitable and finally I will not talk about 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.599
 the love story between naruto and 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.449
 hinata since if I had you in 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:31.210
 talk I'll ruin 98% of the movie 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.919
 so here I prefer not to you 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.509
 speak 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.189
 the video is now complete in 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.779
 hoping that she will have pleased you despite the 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.199
 duration of it but as I said 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.060
 earlier 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.340
 I tried not to get into 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.289
 the details so that those who had 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.789
 want to hear my opinion they hear 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.279
 simply and that those who had 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.469
 still want to see the movie is not 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.900
 too spoiled by my explanations 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.129
 So here I hope that the duration of 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.960
 this video is right for you 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.219

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.539
