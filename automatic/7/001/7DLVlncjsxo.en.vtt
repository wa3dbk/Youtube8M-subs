here's<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:31.859> cut<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> take<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
here's the first cut is going to take a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.100 
here's the first cut is going to take a
little<00:00:33.120> bit<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> side<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> breastbone

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little bit on the side of the breastbone

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590 
little bit on the side of the breastbone
to<00:00:34.649> write<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.280> case<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.390> sliding

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to write in this case and we're sliding

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
to write in this case and we're sliding
all<00:00:36.780> over<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> cold<00:00:38.430> turkey

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
all over them this is a cold turkey

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
all over them this is a cold turkey
which<00:00:39.570> means<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> knife<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which means the knife is going to have a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.600 
which means the knife is going to have a
little<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.770> trouble<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.219> through<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
little more trouble going through it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
little more trouble going through it
then<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.000> oppressive<00:00:42.690> baked<00:00:42.870> turkey<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
then it was oppressive baked turkey this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
then it was oppressive baked turkey this
is<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:43.980> easier<00:00:44.010> process<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
is much easier process but a lot of the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
is much easier process but a lot of the
juices<00:00:45.780> run<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.140> onto<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> chopping<00:00:47.010> board

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
juices run out onto the chopping board

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700 
juices run out onto the chopping board
not<00:00:47.600> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.780> well<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> was

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not going to do that well this way I was

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
not going to do that well this way I was
just<00:00:49.829> kept<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> bird<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> ready<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.899> do

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
just kept in the bird to you ready to do

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
just kept in the bird to you ready to do
that<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.920> how<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.100> probably<00:00:53.340> turn<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that you see how I'm probably turn the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.319 
that you see how I'm probably turn the
knife<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.480> board<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> wing<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.969> along<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
knife to board the wing to go along the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.510 
knife to board the wing to go along the
rich<00:00:57.480> bone<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.890> opening<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
rich bone so I'm opening that up a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
rich bone so I'm opening that up a
little<00:00:59.670> bit<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.320> using<00:01:01.620> tip<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
little bit and then just using tip of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
little bit and then just using tip of
the<00:01:02.010> knife<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.149> trying<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> cut<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the knife and then trying to cut the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.740 
the knife and then trying to cut the
meat<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.710> pushing<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> bone<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
meat is pushing me off in the bone so I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
meat is pushing me off in the bone so I
get<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.380> again<00:01:07.710> joint<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.850> then

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
get down to this again joint and then

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.130 
get down to this again joint and then
we're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> separate<00:01:09.720> between<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we're going to separate between the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
we're going to separate between the
joints<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.710> put<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> whole<00:01:11.159> section<00:01:11.430> off<00:01:11.700> like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
joints and put a whole section off like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
joints and put a whole section off like
that<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.799> basically<00:01:14.130> same<00:01:14.430> function<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that and the basically same function on

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
that and the basically same function on
the<00:01:15.030> other<00:01:15.119> side<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> take<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the other side we're going to take the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
the other side we're going to take the
UM<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.130> other<00:01:17.640> side<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:19.759> go<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.659> order

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
UM the other side go it off go in order

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
UM the other side go it off go in order
wings<00:01:22.110> we're<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> cut<00:01:23.040> break<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
wings we're just going to cut break it

and cut through the wind joints and then

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
and cut through the wind joints and then
one<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> bit<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.100> almost
