00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
I am so freaking confused but I assume

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.559 
I am so freaking confused but I assume
we<00:02:59.920> have<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.160> go<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:03.150> okay<00:03:04.150> let's<00:03:04.420> try

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
we have to go in here okay let's try

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.270 
we have to go in here okay let's try
this<00:03:04.660> again<00:03:05.200> maybe<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.620> was<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.100> right

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
this again maybe that was in the right

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.479 
this again maybe that was in the right
place<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:06.940> have<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.360> go<00:03:07.450> down<00:03:11.040> yeah<00:03:14.489> I

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
place I just have to go down yeah I

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.479 
place I just have to go down yeah I
can't<00:03:16.390> go<00:03:16.569> right

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
can't go right

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.070 
can't go right
well<00:03:18.489> at<00:03:18.580> least<00:03:18.670> they<00:03:18.880> did<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.840> thought

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
well at least they did that I thought

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.020 
well at least they did that I thought
there<00:03:20.320> was<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.680> path<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.400> went<00:03:21.610> right<00:03:22.680> so

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
there was like a path that went right so

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.070 
there was like a path that went right so
we<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.300> go<00:03:25.390> down<00:03:26.850> and

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.590 

and<00:03:31.430> apparently<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.910> stuff<00:03:33.210> in<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> middle

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and apparently the stuff in the middle

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.810 
and apparently the stuff in the middle
is<00:03:33.930> death<00:03:37.010> see<00:03:39.260> let's<00:03:40.260> go
