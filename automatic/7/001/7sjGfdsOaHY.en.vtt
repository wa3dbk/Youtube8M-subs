I'm seeing in this one it essentially

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
I'm seeing in this one it essentially
looks<00:01:33.930> worse<00:01:34.500> than<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> previous<00:01:35.340> titles<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
looks worse than the previous titles the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
looks worse than the previous titles the
layout<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.290> city<00:01:37.500> has<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:37.950> least<00:01:37.979> be

layout of the city has to at least be
halfway<00:01:38.490> decent<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.180> order<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> enjoy

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
