Rider<00:01:28.750> convert<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.850> after<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.880> watch<00:01:31.180> double

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630

Rider convert so after I watch double
here<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:31.869> December<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:33.159> started<00:01:33.790> looking<00:01:34.030> for<00:01:34.270> a

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
here in December I started looking for a

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.770 
here in December I started looking for a
double<00:01:34.990> driver<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:37.090> realized<00:01:37.450> pretty

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
double driver and I realized pretty

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.440 
double driver and I realized pretty
quickly<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.890> normal<00:01:39.700> price<00:01:39.909> range<00:01:40.240> on

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
quickly that the normal price range on

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.399 
quickly that the normal price range on
those<00:01:40.659> was<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:42.280> high<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.840> when<00:01:44.259> this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
those was pretty high so when this

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.770 
those was pretty high so when this
korean<00:01:44.860> version<00:01:45.040> came<00:01:45.430> out<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:45.969> seemed<00:01:46.570> like<00:01:46.750> a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
korean version came out it seemed like a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.380 
korean version came out it seemed like a
pretty<00:01:47.170> affordable<00:01:47.560> option<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.700> jumped<00:01:49.270> on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
pretty affordable option so I jumped on

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.679 
pretty affordable option so I jumped on
it<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:51.009> as<00:01:51.340> many<00:01:51.670> people<00:01:52.030> have<00:01:52.180> heard<00:01:52.420> by<00:01:52.659> now

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
it now as many people have heard by now

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.020 
it now as many people have heard by now
the<00:01:53.229> voices<00:01:53.799> on<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.040> Gaian<00:01:54.369> memories<00:01:54.759> have

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
the voices on the Gaian memories have

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.630 
the voices on the Gaian memories have
been<00:01:55.210> changed<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.079> match<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.770> korean<00:01:57.250> dub<00:01:57.520> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
been changed to match the korean dub of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.179 
been changed to match the korean dub of
the<00:01:57.759> show<00:01:58.170> while<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.200> voice<00:01:59.500> isn't<00:01:59.890> too

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
the show while the voice isn't too

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.950 
the show while the voice isn't too
different<00:02:00.460> if<00:02:00.880> you're<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.119> die-hard<00:02:01.360> fan<00:02:01.600> of

different if you're a die-hard fan of

the Japanese version of the show it can

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.870 
the Japanese version of the show it can
be<00:02:04.270> irritating<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:06.070> let's<00:02:06.250> take<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> look<00:02:06.700> at

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
be irritating so let's take a look at

be irritating so let's take a look at
them

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.920 

let's<00:02:16.340> take<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> look<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.970> demonstration<00:02:17.269> of

let's take a look at a demonstration of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:03:46.550 
let's take a look at a demonstration of
the<00:02:18.290> driver<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.819> gaia<00:02:20.000> memories

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.140

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.800 
the show may not be able to tell the the
difference<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.739> tone<00:03:56.980> between<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
difference in the tone between the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.970 
difference in the tone between the
Korean<00:03:58.810> version<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.439> what<00:03:59.680> we're<00:03:59.859> all

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
Korean version and what we're all

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.589 
Korean version and what we're all
familiar<00:04:00.159> with<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.169> comparison<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:03.599> have

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
familiar with so as a comparison I have

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.860 
familiar with so as a comparison I have
a<00:04:04.629> set<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.730> capsule<00:04:06.730> memories<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:07.659> we

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
a set of capsule memories here that we

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.569 
a set of capsule memories here that we
can<00:04:08.049> use<00:04:08.079> as<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> comparison<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:12.159> ones<00:04:12.400> on

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
can use as a comparison so the ones on

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.759 
can use as a comparison so the ones on
the<00:04:12.669> left<00:04:12.879> here<00:04:13.269> are<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.319> Korean<00:04:14.829> versions

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
the left here are the Korean versions

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.229 
the left here are the Korean versions
the<00:04:17.769> ones<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.099> have<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> right<00:04:18.820> are<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the ones I have on the right are the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.469 
the ones I have on the right are the
Japanese<00:04:20.229> capsule<00:04:21.039> memories<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.180> think

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
Japanese capsule memories so I think

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.120 
Japanese capsule memories so I think
it's<00:04:25.599> pretty<00:04:25.840> easy<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.440> tell<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> difference

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
it's pretty easy to tell the difference

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.249 
it's pretty easy to tell the difference
between<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.639> two<00:04:27.820> when<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.240> hear<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:29.110> hear

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
between the two when you hear you hear

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:38.070 
between the two when you hear you hear
them<00:04:29.440> next<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.830> each<00:04:29.889> other<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.720> let's<00:04:37.900> just

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
them next to each other so let's just

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.100 
them next to each other so let's just
continue<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.530> go<00:04:38.740> down<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.070> line<00:04:39.220> here<00:04:40.110> here

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
continue to go down the line here here

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:57.030 
continue to go down the line here here
we<00:04:41.260> have<00:04:41.289> cyclone

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:18.730 

and<00:04:58.040> heat<00:05:15.220> now<00:05:16.220> this<00:05:16.550> one<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:17.480> me<00:05:17.660> is<00:05:17.930> probably

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
and heat now this one to me is probably

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:37.540 
and heat now this one to me is probably
the<00:05:19.040> biggest<00:05:19.430> difference<00:05:19.960> we<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:20.990> Luna<00:05:36.550> one

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
the biggest difference we have Luna one

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.950 
the biggest difference we have Luna one
of<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.730> nice<00:05:37.910> things<00:05:38.210> about<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:38.660> is<00:05:38.930> that

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
of the nice things about this is that

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.770 
of the nice things about this is that
because<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.800> driver<00:05:40.070> itself<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.880> pretty<00:05:41.540> much

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
because the driver itself is pretty much

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.980 
because the driver itself is pretty much
identical<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:43.010> Japanese<00:05:43.520> version<00:05:44.090> you

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
identical to the Japanese version you

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.730 
identical to the Japanese version you
can<00:05:45.230> take<00:05:45.560> other<00:05:46.040> memories<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:47.350> put<00:05:48.350> them<00:05:48.560> in

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
can take other memories and put them in

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.190 
can take other memories and put them in
it<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.120> get<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.360> same<00:05:50.540> result<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.020> would

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
it and get the same result you would

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.260 
it and get the same result you would
have<00:05:51.320> had<00:05:51.500> if<00:05:51.800> you<00:05:51.980> had<00:05:52.280> bought<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.790> Japanese

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
have had if you had bought the Japanese

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:07.420 
have had if you had bought the Japanese
version<00:05:53.750> originally<00:06:03.760> in<00:06:05.650> my<00:06:06.650> opinion<00:06:07.130> the

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
version originally in my opinion the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.980 
version originally in my opinion the
Korean<00:06:07.880> double<00:06:08.210> driver<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.660> a<00:06:08.690> good

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
Korean double driver is a good

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.080 
Korean double driver is a good
affordable<00:06:09.740> alternative<00:06:10.340> to<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.640> original

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
affordable alternative to the original

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.630 
affordable alternative to the original
while<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.020> included<00:06:12.470> gaya<00:06:12.680> memories<00:06:13.160> may<00:06:13.430> not

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
while the included gaya memories may not

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.000 
while the included gaya memories may not
pass<00:06:13.910> muster<00:06:14.210> you<00:06:14.720> can<00:06:14.900> easily<00:06:15.110> find<00:06:15.560> memories

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
pass muster you can easily find memories

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.740 
pass muster you can easily find memories
on<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.280> after<00:06:16.580> market<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:17.060> will<00:06:17.180> sound<00:06:17.360> much

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
on the after market that will sound much

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.879 
on the after market that will sound much
better

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.529
