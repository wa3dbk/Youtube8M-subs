00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.130
 this pattern is knitted by different threads 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 thickness 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 where we knit 4 rows knit 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.830
 thinner thread where we knit 2 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.900
 row knit thick main thread 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.490
 thick finishing thin and so 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.700
 pushing hinges to the front non-working 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 position between you these put forward in 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.550
 period needles 8 needles stand in work 8 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040
 work two put forward 8 work 2 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 invent taking 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.839
 knitting finishing thin thread 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.839
 three rows 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:00.790
 I put all the needles into position two 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:02.470
 row of the main thread plump front 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.059
 non-working position push the same 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 the very needles that just got me 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.090
 stood in front of four more rows 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.750
 put them back two 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.580
 basic plump times so repeat 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.270
 four times that is you see i have 4 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.140
 Here are these tweak nakida such here I 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.950
 knitted 2 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.680
 I knit two more on the same needles here 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.780
 own whole drawing after since i 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.539
 I'll knit four times like this 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.360
 Here are four such protection I put in 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.570
 front working position needle between 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:57.160
 I mean them just in places 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:58.869
 Now I see 4 more rows 4 this is the minimum 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.450
 can knit more if the machine 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.170
 allows will be even more interesting so such 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.390
 here are the letters 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:17.950
 the reaction of fanfi puffs with puffs to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:19.690
 own last stay like 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.709
 all fangi this drawing fit in very 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.989
 fast and easy 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.270
 but as all the fangs are very interesting 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:31.630
 looks so unusual due to exactly 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.930
 the fact that we knit threads of different thickness 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.920
 i'm going to bloom 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.450
 this whole picture is warped 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.450
 It turns out such an interesting effect
