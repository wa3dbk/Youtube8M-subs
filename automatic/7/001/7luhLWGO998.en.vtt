00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
series is there are all sorts of

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.499 
series is there are all sorts of
commands<00:01:20.560> but<00:01:21.399> I'm<00:01:21.520> going<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:21.969> teach<00:01:22.179> them

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
commands but I'm going to teach them

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.899 
commands but I'm going to teach them
which<00:01:23.170> are<00:01:23.380> useful<00:01:23.560> in<00:01:23.920> just<00:01:24.130> everyday<00:01:24.460> life

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
which are useful in just everyday life

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.929 
which are useful in just everyday life
with<00:01:25.659> your<00:01:25.840> dogs<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.289> have<00:01:26.439> an<00:01:26.590> obedient<00:01:27.429> dog

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
with your dogs to have an obedient dog

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.739 
with your dogs to have an obedient dog
now<00:01:28.929> I<00:01:29.350> think<00:01:30.280> when<00:01:30.429> you're<00:01:30.579> teaching<00:01:30.789> poms<00:01:31.389> is

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
now I think when you're teaching poms is

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.489 
now I think when you're teaching poms is
very<00:01:31.959> important<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:33.039> always<00:01:33.340> be<00:01:33.700> patient<00:01:34.499> keep

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
very important to always be patient keep

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.419 
very important to always be patient keep
it<00:01:35.740> fun<00:01:36.069> and<00:01:37.049> keep<00:01:38.049> their<00:01:38.229> enthusiasm<00:01:38.889> going

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
it fun and keep their enthusiasm going

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.129 
it fun and keep their enthusiasm going
and<00:01:39.639> then<00:01:39.789> you'll<00:01:39.969> get<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.240> best<00:01:40.420> performance

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
and then you'll get the best performance

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.550 
and then you'll get the best performance
from<00:01:41.259> them<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.569> first<00:01:43.600> exercise<00:01:44.079> that

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
from them so the first exercise that

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.949 
from them so the first exercise that
we're<00:01:44.889> going<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.219> do<00:01:45.459> today<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.479> teach

them<00:01:47.139> how<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.380> wait<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.959> reason<00:01:50.380> why<00:01:50.529> this

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
them how to wait now the reason why this

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.190 
them how to wait now the reason why this
is<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.579> good<00:01:51.789> command<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.299> teach<00:01:52.539> them<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.049> if

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.979 
they're full of enthusiasm it pulls on
their<00:04:17.859> neck<00:04:18.009> and<00:04:18.220> throat<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:19.150> know<00:04:19.269> makes

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
their neck and throat you know makes

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.680 
their neck and throat you know makes
them<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.259> bit<00:04:20.349> gagging<00:04:20.829> like<00:04:21.009> that<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:22.180> tried

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
them a bit gagging like that so I tried

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.080 
them a bit gagging like that so I tried
avoid<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.130> harness<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.880> best

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
avoid that and harness is the best

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.020 
avoid that and harness is the best
solution<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.770> I'm<00:04:27.280> going<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.490> keep<00:04:27.699> her<00:04:27.849> on<00:04:28.000> her

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
solution so I'm going to keep her on her

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.900 
solution so I'm going to keep her on her
harness<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.169> I'm<00:04:29.740> hopefully<00:04:30.340> she's<00:04:30.639> going<00:04:30.820> to

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
harness and I'm hopefully she's going to

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.560 
harness and I'm hopefully she's going to
sit<00:04:31.440> sit<00:04:32.849> busy<00:04:33.880> sit

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
small little stats like that I'm going

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.299 
small little stats like that I'm going
to<00:04:47.210> slowly<00:04:47.479> move<00:04:47.930> back<00:04:48.289> one<00:04:48.650> step<00:04:49.039> further

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:49.309 
to slowly move back one step further

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.209 
to slowly move back one step further
each<00:04:49.699> time<00:04:49.729> I<00:04:50.180> do<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.569> also<00:04:51.529> when<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.770> do<00:04:51.889> the

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
each time I do it also when I do the

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.040 
each time I do it also when I do the
weight<00:04:52.370> command<00:04:52.789> I<00:04:52.999> like<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.300> do<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.539> flat<00:04:53.809> in

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
weight command I like to do the flat in

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.469 
weight command I like to do the flat in
my<00:04:54.169> hand<00:04:54.439> like<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.339> think<00:04:55.999> this<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.300> quite

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
my hand like that I think this is quite

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.659 
my hand like that I think this is quite
useful<00:04:56.870> because<00:04:57.259> sometimes<00:04:57.860> especially<00:04:58.009> here

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
useful because sometimes especially here

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.959 
useful because sometimes especially here
in<00:04:58.789> Scotland<00:04:59.120> with<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.749> wind<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.490> noises<00:05:01.490> and

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
in Scotland with the wind and noises and

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.219 
in Scotland with the wind and noises and
things<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:02.449> that<00:05:02.509> they<00:05:02.870> might<00:05:03.080> not

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
things like that they might not

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.649 
things like that they might not
necessarily<00:05:03.439> hear<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.639> but<00:05:05.240> if<00:05:05.300> they<00:05:05.449> have<00:05:05.629> a

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
necessarily hear you but if they have a

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.049 
necessarily hear you but if they have a
visual<00:05:06.169> command<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.710> go<00:05:06.830> by<00:05:07.099> as<00:05:07.279> well<00:05:07.520> see<00:05:07.879> your

is going to show what were actually
trying<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.400> achieve<00:05:46.760> here<00:05:47.120> so<00:05:48.020> she's<00:05:48.260> going<00:05:48.440> to

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
trying to achieve here so she's going to

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.040 
trying to achieve here so she's going to
make<00:05:48.740> either<00:05:49.010> weight<00:05:49.400> sitting<00:05:50.210> wait<00:05:50.540> so<00:05:50.870> she's

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
make either weight sitting wait so she's

going to move to the other side of the
jump<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:53.000> then<00:05:53.479> recall<00:05:53.810> her<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.139> go<00:05:54.229> over<00:05:54.530> the

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
jump and then recall her to go over the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:16.320 
jump and then recall her to go over the
jump<00:05:54.800> when<00:05:55.040> she's<00:05:55.250> ready<00:06:07.479> there<00:06:08.479> we<00:06:08.510> go
