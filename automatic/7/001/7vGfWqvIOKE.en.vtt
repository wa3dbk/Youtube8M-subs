00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.800
 welcome to no knife 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.350
 Customers today are showing the right way 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.170
 Well, we do one today 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.210
 Japanese rattled salad with salmon and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.400
 what do you say it starts right away with that 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.290
 small knife my favorite topic when 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.989
 Cutting onions commutes from home 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.730
 because it's a pleasure to cry a lot 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.040
 dull knife and the wrong one 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.530
 cutting technique small knife woman 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.879
 this beautiful country in any case if 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.500
 I put my hand in between , I 'm even 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.010
 not on the floor because of edge 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.960
 slip 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.790
 important when cutting with a small one 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.950
 knife once attached to the knife 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.989
 hand and also do not cut 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.789
 go and press that would squeeze 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.430
 then the juice comes out and me 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.260
 must weep and therefore cry 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.460
 a cutting motion in the small 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.410
 You can already see a little bit of knives 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.680
 the finger on it and have thereby one 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.600
 better stop and then go back like that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 onion prepared so far it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.440
 at larger I would start from the beginning 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.729
 to cut it again makes me that 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.710
 live a little easier 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.240
 but now to cut down for the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.789
 dice if we make this knife too small 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.459
 ie exchange them for a 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.810
 Chef's advantage with the chef's knife 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.399
 One is I put my hand here 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.440
 threaten accordingly a beautiful 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.300
 move and do not come up with the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.459
 hand comes from prep so the blade on 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.619
 Brett and I can be up front 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.929
 to support means I cut only in 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.060
 Rear area is front on life 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.679
 my hand when cutting and can 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.560
 now at the beginning of the cradle movement 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.509
 either forward or backward 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 I'm not so good at the back, but I prefer it 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.369
 push forward and so I cut 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.050
 my onion into fine dice 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.670
 this is also a classic theme 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.979
 topic chives say evil tongues 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.319
 also press or squeeze or squeeze 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.270
 he really needs to be cut 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.670
 you should show host even better 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.349
 only move in this area if 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.369
 I now would be too far forward 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.289
 I would have to far too far with knives 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.479
 So really move backwards 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.610
 at this area as close as possible to 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.280
 together and I let him piece 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.440
 still lying trims forward 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 and hiker while doing it slowly by hand 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.920
 back important turn sharp otherwise 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 It can happen again that I have the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.400
 hack herbs and then it will be 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.770
 that means bitter must be really nice 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.080
 then the same is true 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.400
 over here for my paprika 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 I have a knife with me now 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.630
 you can already say cool Poland 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.550
 see small recesses through the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.050
 Well it is easier I have 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.360
 less friction what do you know about 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.950
 Cheese knife once overlap of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 cut the similar technique fingers 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.720
 Create at the side and turn 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.090
 start by pushing it all in 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.830
 fine stripes crooked fold again 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 knife abut again back area 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.730
 and then finely dice the whole thing and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.800
 through the cool slides all the way 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.680
 better then what we have now 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 salad so far prepared the ingredients 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.790
 I give in my bowl something 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.260
 For me now , salmon is the salmon 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.110
 I have already prepared so far 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.030
 Speaks fried and seasoned problematic 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.350
 Every salmon is very fine and very 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.090
 unstable to cut 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.010
 Here I have to pay attention here 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.990
 i take a long knife around the beautiful one 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 cut the guys make beautiful narrow 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.850
 that means now hang up and knife 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.459
 also draw here really go out and 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.310
 pull and pull and so come 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.440
 I without any problems setback by the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.990
 looks great salad is 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.230
 marinated with a bit of soy sauce and 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.910
 sesam I start now as the first 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.170
 wreak on the plate 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.970
 and there we put our fried salmon 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.780
 then the whole thing to the conclusion 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:47.980
 garnish with wasabi and a little bit 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 Little Thai basil outstanding
