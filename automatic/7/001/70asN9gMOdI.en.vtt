no broken jaw bones nothing we work

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.790 
no broken jaw bones nothing we work
right<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.270> mouth<00:00:58.420> these<00:00:59.260> techniques<00:00:59.620> are

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
right to the mouth these techniques are

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.080 
right to the mouth these techniques are
revolutionary<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.760> they<00:01:00.880> allow

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
revolutionary and that they allow

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.600 
revolutionary and that they allow

miniaturized tools to work in the mouth
that<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.910> as<00:01:04.059> if<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.390> surgeons<00:01:04.839> hands<00:01:05.080> were

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
that is as if the surgeons hands were

surgical<00:01:27.609> tours<00:01:27.880> probably<00:01:28.749> the<00:01:28.840> most

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
surgical tours probably the most

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.919 
surgical tours probably the most
exciting<00:01:29.140> aspect<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.130> tours<00:01:30.759> from<00:01:31.030> my

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
exciting aspect of tours from my

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.200 
exciting aspect of tours from my
perspective<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.829> when<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.340> see<00:01:33.609> the<00:01:33.729> patients

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
perspective is when I see the patients

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.349 
perspective is when I see the patients
in<00:01:34.329> my<00:01:34.359> clinic<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.740> see<00:01:36.039> how<00:01:36.490> happy<00:01:37.149> they

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
in my clinic and I see how happy they

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.910 
in my clinic and I see how happy they
are<00:01:37.389> and<00:01:37.569> how<00:01:37.719> satisfied<00:01:38.289> they<00:01:38.319> are<00:01:38.679> after

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
are and how satisfied they are after

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.279 
are and how satisfied they are after
these<00:01:39.639> treatments<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.479> me<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:40.749> remarkable

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
these treatments to me it's remarkable

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.219 
these treatments to me it's remarkable
that<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:42.280> few<00:01:42.520> years<00:01:42.759> ago<00:01:42.909> we<00:01:43.689> were<00:01:43.840> treating

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
that a few years ago we were treating

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.289 
that a few years ago we were treating
patients<00:01:44.439> with<00:01:44.799> very<00:01:45.039> radical<00:01:45.490> surgery<00:01:45.520> or

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
patients with very radical surgery or

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.969 
patients with very radical surgery or
high<00:01:46.600> intensity<00:01:47.079> chemotherapy<00:01:47.859> and

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
high intensity chemotherapy and

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.219 
high intensity chemotherapy and
radiation<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.569> much<00:01:49.719> of<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:49.959> can<00:01:50.139> be

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
radiation and so much of that can be

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.840 
radiation and so much of that can be

I think one of the things that tours has
done<00:05:20.530> for<00:05:20.710> us<00:05:20.740> which<00:05:20.980> has<00:05:21.010> been<00:05:21.250> great<00:05:21.520> is<00:05:21.730> it's

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.780 
done for us which has been great is it's
allowed<00:05:22.300> us<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.660> offer<00:05:23.410> patients<00:05:24.160> a<00:05:24.430> different

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
allowed us to offer patients a different

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.700 
allowed us to offer patients a different
option<00:05:25.180> for<00:05:25.450> treatment<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.350> some<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.590> their

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
option for treatment of some of their

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.670 
option for treatment of some of their
cancers<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:28.540> in<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.140> of<00:05:29.170> itself<00:05:29.350> is

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
cancers and that in and of itself is

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.800 
cancers and that in and of itself is
really<00:05:30.550> quite<00:05:30.760> an<00:05:30.880> accomplishment<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.720> know
