I prefer 28 ounce otherwise use your

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.450 
I prefer 28 ounce otherwise use your
unweighted<00:00:29.350> one-stop<00:00:29.800> but<00:00:29.920> these<00:00:30.039> are<00:00:30.160> 28

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.910 
ounce tins we start with the grip on
them<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:34.120> most<00:00:34.300> important<00:00:34.690> thing<00:00:34.920> fingers

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
them is the most important thing fingers

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.189 
them is the most important thing fingers
all<00:00:36.220> four<00:00:36.460> fingers<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:37.000> one<00:00:37.030> side<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.780> then

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
all four fingers on one side and then

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.900 
all four fingers on one side and then
the<00:00:38.230> thumb<00:00:38.590> actually<00:00:39.070> goes<00:00:39.190> right<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:39.820> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
the thumb actually goes right in the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.670 
the thumb actually goes right in the
middle<00:00:40.090> so<00:00:40.360> putting<00:00:40.660> your<00:00:40.780> thumb<00:00:41.050> inside<00:00:41.440> and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
then make sure that they're not stuck

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.910 
then make sure that they're not stuck
together<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:44.020> otherwise<00:00:44.290> they're<00:00:44.530> not<00:00:44.680> gonna

together so otherwise they're not gonna
they're<00:00:45.340> not<00:00:45.430> gonna<00:00:45.610> come<00:00:45.820> apart<00:00:46.090> so<00:00:46.300> you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
they're not gonna come apart so you

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.270 
they're not gonna come apart so you
really<00:00:47.170> want<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.410> put<00:00:47.530> just<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.890> little<00:00:48.100> bit<00:00:48.190> of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
let this pendulum swing to decide we're

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.569 
let this pendulum swing to decide we're
not<00:00:56.320> gonna<00:00:56.500> bother<00:00:56.680> trying<00:00:57.100> behind<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.460> back

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
not gonna bother trying behind the back

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.310 
not gonna bother trying behind the back
yet<00:00:57.850> we're<00:00:58.300> just<00:00:58.450> gonna<00:00:58.539> focus<00:00:58.780> on<00:00:59.020> getting

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
yet we're just gonna focus on getting

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.560 
yet we're just gonna focus on getting
this<00:00:59.440> nice<00:00:59.710> comfortable<00:01:00.370> practice<00:01:01.270> thing<00:01:01.450> to

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
this nice comfortable practice thing to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.000 
this nice comfortable practice thing to
throw<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.050> catch<00:01:02.230> right<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.649> front<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.890> us

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
throw in the catch right in front of us

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.240 
throw in the catch right in front of us
so<00:01:03.699> repeat<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.440> our<00:01:05.440> elbow<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.860> facing<00:01:06.190> that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
so repeat this our elbow is facing that

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.529 
so repeat this our elbow is facing that
way<00:01:06.399> our<00:01:06.520> wrist<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:06.910> facing<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.360> way<00:01:07.479> and

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
way our wrist is facing that way and

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.330 
way our wrist is facing that way and
it's<00:01:07.690> really<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.259> flick<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.920> wrist

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it's really just a flick of the wrist

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.609 
it's really just a flick of the wrist
let<00:01:09.759> them<00:01:09.910> separate<00:01:10.360> practice<00:01:11.170> getting

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
let them separate practice getting

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.499 
let them separate practice getting
comfortable<00:01:11.979> knowing<00:01:12.340> like<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.300> throw<00:01:13.479> a

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
comfortable knowing like if you throw a

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:14.940 
comfortable knowing like if you throw a
little<00:01:13.630> harder<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:14.170> gonna<00:01:14.229> come<00:01:14.500> more<00:01:14.680> this

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
little harder it's gonna come more this

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.289 
little harder it's gonna come more this
way<00:01:15.190> if<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:15.640> spin<00:01:15.880> your<00:01:15.939> wrist<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.210> little

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
way if you spin your wrist a little

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.640 
way if you spin your wrist a little
faster<00:01:16.780> well<00:01:16.960> how<00:01:17.020> that's<00:01:17.229> gonna<00:01:17.380> change

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
faster well how that's gonna change

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.990 
faster well how that's gonna change
things<00:01:17.950> until<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.580> can<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.790> comfortable

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
things until you can get comfortable

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.219 
things until you can get comfortable
that<00:01:19.330> they're<00:01:19.450> both<00:01:19.540> being<00:01:19.780> caught

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
that they're both being caught

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.810 
that they're both being caught
right<00:01:20.320> about<00:01:20.500> here<00:01:20.560> once<00:01:21.460> you're<00:01:21.549> good<00:01:21.700> with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
right about here once you're good with

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.340 
right about here once you're good with
that<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.450> theory<00:01:22.869> all<00:01:22.990> we're<00:01:23.110> gonna<00:01:23.200> do<00:01:23.320> is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
that in theory all we're gonna do is

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.770 
that in theory all we're gonna do is
gonna<00:01:23.590> kind<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:23.860> step<00:01:24.100> forward<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.760> kind<00:01:25.720> of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
gonna kind of step forward and kind of

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.940 
gonna kind of step forward and kind of
bring<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:25.990> arm<00:01:26.140> around<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.530> little<00:01:26.590> bit<00:01:26.770> more

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
bring the arm around a little bit more

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.520 
bring the arm around a little bit more
so<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.759> can<00:01:28.299> get<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.140> come<00:01:29.259> all<00:01:29.439> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
so that we can get that to come all the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.230 
so that we can get that to come all the
way<00:01:29.560> across<00:01:29.770> again<00:01:30.250> then<00:01:30.670> do<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:30.909> behind<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
