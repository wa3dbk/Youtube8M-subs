00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
really collectibles but discs were the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.300 
really collectibles but discs were the
mean<00:00:27.990> collectibles<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:28.949> why<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
mean collectibles so that's why of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.180 
mean collectibles so that's why of
course<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> rear<00:00:30.029> disc<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:30.859> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.010 

now<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.340> not<00:00:35.489> quite<00:00:35.910> sure<00:00:36.030> where<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> came

from but I think it might have came at
the<00:00:39.030> same<00:00:39.230> was<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.070> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
why it came sabaki you and it would have

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
why it came sabaki you and it would have
made<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.060> sense<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> came<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
made more sense if it came with the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.039 
made more sense if it came with the
Pacala<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.700> or<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.930> made

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
Pacala and or actually would have made

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
Pacala and or actually would have made
more<00:01:58.320> sense<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> came<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.520> collecting

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
more sense if this came from collecting

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
more sense if this came from collecting
the<00:02:00.180> discs<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> collectibles<00:02:01.380> this

out of the disk of time and this is made

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.300 
out of the disk of time and this is made
when<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.470> combine<00:02:28.799> all<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.340> great<00:02:29.519> disks
