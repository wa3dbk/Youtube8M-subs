00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.560
 hello i my social and this is the man smooth 0 0 55 x problem 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.539
 in the man's box we also feel 0 55 eriksen problem of course 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.880
 it's a type itself 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 and the key to tighten the nuts 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.539
 if we have the or otto 0 55 I am playing you can take a closer look 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.859
 we see here the blame for this at your institute 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.380
 mount head 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.070
 here the screws three pieces 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.520
 to properly secure the head of the city 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.930
 this is a few spirit level of course then we have it here 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.330
 why must sit 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.649
 if you have those loose cards you can determine the direction or the 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.130
 height from brecht center column 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.460
 they can go on for a while 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.250
 turn around then you see a squat around a strap when assembling 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.740
 and here a hook for example to adjust your room to the homestead thieves 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.870
 give more weight in windy situations 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.969
 every tripod building also has such a head 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.619
 this can be used to also the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.960
 the hook 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.150
 according to the ico to set them in the neighborhood 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 who plays 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.190
 9 9 degrees 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 be turned 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.090
 then we have on two of the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.890
 3x hectic planting 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 sit leg warmers 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.469
 the worries that you will not get the preliminary round in the winter 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.120
 and below we still have the clamps around the length of the legs 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.140
 and also popped up in the morning hours 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.360
 legs 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.340
 if we have the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.250
 the middle would take a closer look than you also have one here 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.640
 button 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.650
 and if, for example, you have to lift the head, you can also do what the now 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 so rosenthal of course I'm going to give them so show 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.980
 on top also 55 I am trying to get but set up because of this 2 click 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.600
 than here 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 all you have to do is make it suddenly 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.580
 unsubscribe 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.870
 this they then more 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.780
 that we returned mention there is also one 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.149
 key with 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.219
 made single cards 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
 for the words in this 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.730
 lately they can become a bit loose 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.729
 but then they can easily again 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:19.999
 in the lead 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.069
 with this the keys 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.950
 the midfielder can of course also go up by doing this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.649
 to loosen wing nuts 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.469
 came to inform 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.659
 tighten 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.760
 and if that is quite high and we have to use a tripod ourselves 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.239
 head on top 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.829
 he really came to war 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.060
 market in europe is the fact that you 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.489
 the middle room too 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.939
 9 degrees horizontally 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.439
 what want to follow again the 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.089
 unscrew a little and new at the bottom of the clock press 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.009
 the continues upwards 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.349
 Fold forward 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.589
 and back again 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:55.849
 and according to 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.199
 you can easily take pictures from the ground 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.499
 when we see a very strange position where the traffic can stand 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.149
 two out of three customers are equally happy and the middle room also has one 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.729
 tilted so that he can easily get to the ground I have unfortunately left 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.009
 However, macro lens but broken try to take a macro-like photo 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.139
 twente live view 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.739
 m focus 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.739
 and he cast an example 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.840
 the plans for the break are made of plastic and this will take time 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.800
 to turn on time and effort 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.220
 and they dragged option to turn the moura so included 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 ultimately no problems 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.759
 it is a very solid professional tripod 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.850
 the ability to place the middle room to be translated in an instant 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.929
 gives that little bit extra 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:50.489
 are you looking for a good that is against which you also make it easier 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.420
 can take photos close to the ground 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.700
 then you definitely need the man photo 0 55 I see the problem 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:57.310
 to consider 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.370
 the first against ordering then go to step they print on or point b 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.700
 the bank will look and see you next time
