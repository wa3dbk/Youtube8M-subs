point next take the other remaining

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.010 
point next take the other remaining
corner<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:39.920> do<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.670> same<00:03:40.880> step<00:03:41.330> so<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.870> you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
corner and do the same step so that you

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
under to make place it into the pocket

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.660 
under to make place it into the pocket
easier<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.110> then<00:03:51.590> you'll<00:03:51.740> want<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> tuck<00:03:52.430> this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
easier and then you'll want to tuck this

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.760 
easier and then you'll want to tuck this
side<00:03:52.910> around<00:03:53.180> as<00:03:53.480> well<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:54.290> doesn't<00:03:54.470> have<00:03:54.650> to

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
side around as well it doesn't have to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.400 
side around as well it doesn't have to
be<00:03:54.860> perfect<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.490> idea<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.990> at

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
be perfect but the idea is to have at

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.700 
be perfect but the idea is to have at
two<00:03:58.040> or<00:03:58.190> three<00:03:58.220> peaks<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.780> you<00:04:00.020> can<00:04:00.170> simply

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
two or three peaks and you can simply

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.790 
two or three peaks and you can simply
place<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.310> into<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.760> pocket<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.690> once<00:04:03.650> it

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
place it into the pocket and once it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.960 
place it into the pocket and once it
gets<00:04:03.920> in<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.400> can<00:04:05.350> adjust<00:04:06.350> it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.240
