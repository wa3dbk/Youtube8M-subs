00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.790 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.480> like<00:00:00.780> kind<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.560> what<00:00:01.740> the

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I think like kind of what the

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.590 
I think like kind of what the
inspirations<00:00:02.399> are<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.060> motivating

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
inspirations are like the motivating

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.900 
inspirations are like the motivating
factors<00:00:04.020> for<00:00:04.049> us<00:00:04.290> creating<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.920> team<00:00:05.730> was

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
factors for us creating this team was

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.330 
factors for us creating this team was
kind<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.150> like<00:00:06.299> almost<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.750> lack<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.340> climbing

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
kind of like almost a lack of climbing

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
kind of like almost a lack of climbing
culture<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.150> campus<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.840> least<00:00:09.990> for

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
culture on campus at least for

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.749 
culture on campus at least for
undergraduate<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.160> talked<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.550> lot<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
undergraduate so we talked to a lot of

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.060 
undergraduate so we talked to a lot of
people<00:00:12.330> big<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.769> got<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.040> know

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
people big like we kind of got to know

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.530 
people big like we kind of got to know
the<00:00:14.280> whole<00:00:14.429> structure<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.150> student

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
the whole structure of like student

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.689 
the whole structure of like student
groups<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> clubs<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.470> its<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:17.550> how

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
groups and clubs for its and like how

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.939 
groups and clubs for its and like how
they<00:00:17.880> balance<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.590> definitely

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
they balance out so that is definitely

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.480 
they balance out so that is definitely
like<00:00:20.039> an<00:00:20.160> education<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.949> we're<00:00:23.130> now

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
like an education so like we're now

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.890 
like an education so like we're now
officially<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:24.180> Club<00:00:24.359> sport<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.750> that's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
officially at Club sport so that's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.240 
officially at Club sport so that's
really<00:00:25.109> excited<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> future<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> think

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
really excited but in the future I think

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.839 
really excited but in the future I think
we<00:00:26.519> definitely<00:00:28.070> want<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> grow<00:00:29.310> maybe<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
we definitely want to grow maybe get a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.439 
we definitely want to grow maybe get a
coach

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
coach

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.690 
coach
there's<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> new<00:00:31.830> climbing<00:00:32.550> gym

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
there's going to be a new climbing gym

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.709 
there's going to be a new climbing gym
in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> fall<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.210> that's<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.540> exciting

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
in the fall so that's really exciting

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.170 
in the fall so that's really exciting
for<00:00:34.020> us<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> Stanford

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for us when I got to Stanford

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.799 
for us when I got to Stanford
Andy<00:00:36.660> Lam<00:00:36.870> had<00:00:37.170> contacted<00:00:37.800> me<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.809> climbing

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
Andy Lam had contacted me about climbing

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.830 
Andy Lam had contacted me about climbing
more<00:00:40.290> often<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.340> realized<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.690> know

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
more often and we realized that you know

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.160 
more often and we realized that you know
there<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.210> people<00:00:45.719> who

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
there there are a lot of people who

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430 
there there are a lot of people who
really<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.719> figure

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
really like this and we had to figure

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950 
really like this and we had to figure
out<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.219> wanted<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.879> funding<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.899> we

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
out how we wanted to do funding how we

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
out how we wanted to do funding how we
wanted<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> schedule<00:00:52.710> practices<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> do

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
wanted to schedule practices when to do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
wanted to schedule practices when to do
practices<00:00:55.850> how<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.120> competitions<00:00:57.539> which

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
practices how to do competitions which

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
practices how to do competitions which
competitions<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
competitions to do so there is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.250 
competitions to do so there is
definitely<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:02.359> planning<00:01:03.359> involved<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
definitely a lot of planning involved in

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
definitely a lot of planning involved in
just<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> couple<00:01:04.860> weeks<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> start

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
just a couple weeks we're going to start

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840 
just a couple weeks we're going to start
competing<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:07.140> collegiate<00:01:07.920> climbing<00:01:08.430> series

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
competing in collegiate climbing series

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.620 
competing in collegiate climbing series
and<00:01:09.920> we'll<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.130> where<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.820> takes<00:01:11.880> us<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and we'll see where that takes us in the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
and we'll see where that takes us in the
competitive<00:01:13.200> scene<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.830> practice<00:01:14.220> twice<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
competitive scene we practice twice a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.240 
competitive scene we practice twice a
week<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.150> hours<00:01:15.479> each<00:01:15.720> time<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
week for two hours each time and we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.469 
week for two hours each time and we
start<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
start off with like a little bit of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
start off with like a little bit of
swarming<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.530> birthday<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
swarming out your birthday and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
swarming out your birthday and
stretching<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.880> usually<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.960> two

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
stretching and then usually you have two

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.730 
stretching and then usually you have two
drills<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.920> our<00:01:24.200> endurance<00:01:25.200> drills<00:01:25.560> like

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
drills but our endurance drills like

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.580 
drills but our endurance drills like
laps<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.659> several<00:01:27.900> laps<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
laps or we just do several laps on the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.429 
laps or we just do several laps on the
same<00:01:28.740> route<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.540> other<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.750> strength<00:01:31.140> things

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
same route or other like strength things

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
same route or other like strength things
like<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> pull<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.579> they're

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like a pull up here and then they're

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.890 
like a pull up here and then they're
just<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.659> really

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
just like things that make your really

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
just like things that make your really
really<00:01:33.930> tired<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.549> usually<00:01:35.820> end<00:01:35.970> with

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really tired and I'm usually end with

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.289 
really tired and I'm usually end with
some<00:01:36.360> core<00:01:37.759> well<00:01:38.759> we're<00:01:38.970> super<00:01:39.240> excited

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
some core well we're super excited

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.390 
some core well we're super excited
because<00:01:39.750> they're<00:01:40.170> opening<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.770> much<00:01:41.070> bigger

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
because they're opening a much bigger

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.380 
because they're opening a much bigger
gym<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
gym and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.840 
gym and
Kember<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.590> gym<00:01:43.830> here<00:01:44.070> roughly<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.670> can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
Kember at the gym here roughly this can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
Kember at the gym here roughly this can
have<00:01:45.000> four<00:01:45.659> times<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> surface<00:01:46.350> area<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.830> think

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
have four times the surface area I think

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.300 
have four times the surface area I think
of<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:48.030> that'll<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.810> great<00:01:48.960> because

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
of this one so that'll be great because
