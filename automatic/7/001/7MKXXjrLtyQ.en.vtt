there it's an e V a dual density footbed
so<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.209> allows<00:03:36.479> for<00:03:36.750> good<00:03:36.959> shock<00:03:37.199> absorption

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
so it allows for good shock absorption

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.819 
so it allows for good shock absorption

they start putting gore-tex into product
it<00:03:52.650> significantly<00:03:53.430> raises<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:54.060> cost<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.720> it

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it significantly raises the cost so it

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.449 
it significantly raises the cost so it
