00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.850
 [music] 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.850
 but 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:35.050
 Yesterday I stopped and what device will we turn 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:41.470
 the hood is all but not relevant 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:46.039
 The essence of what this video is not brought immediately 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.170
 before new because we will 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:56.030
 to form it mallero we paint in necessary 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:01:02.270
 color immediately I pulled pulled first here 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:06.080
 this top bar is so to speak for 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.830
 in order to put the wings in place they 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.070
 on impact 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.720
 the parties went away and for the fact that this 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.000
 the bar is straightened and the energy is bending 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.240
 Well, now l thought I decided that the whole 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.650
 in front of it will not be on me, and I 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:32.000
 Only this part I took here 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.600
 here drilled here in this place and here 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.159
 same thing and now i will do the same with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 with new will convey 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.320
 and it turns out that I have the upper part 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.200
 only the bottom will change 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.490
 the one under the bumper under the headlights 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.530
 which is an advantage in my opinion 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.820
 this preservation forces hellish geneticists and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 here here here see everything pretty 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.740
 still well preserved damage 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:18.920
 virtually none ie top 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:23.660
 cars can not even paint try 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.040
 do so and the hood will of course be 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 to be painted on the hood here is a corner of Crimea 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.040
 already shaking paint but in every 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 rarely will the hood be seen 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 traces of repairing the interior is big 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:49.270
 plus that as I try to do something 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.270
 the result will show what happened now 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 looking for filed before amal this case 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:04.370
 hood and firefighter 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.920
 This zone is part of the norm. 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.500
 now my headlight is worth it as it should 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.090
 the hood has a shape which should 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.959
 be 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:22.250
 Now you can safely begin to fall 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:28.400
 lower part of the TV than now 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.640
 I'll take half an hour prepared to do everything 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.379
 trimmed all trimmed 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.379
 now I will put it there and 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.280
 weld 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.519
 see how it happens we insert 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.299
 tv until everything seems to fit 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:55.810
 there was a trifle to install lights lock on 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:04:00.769
 hood and bumper and if everything fits together 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.019
 just scald this item now 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.930
 let's see what happens prime point 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:12.319
 finished now you can take it all apart 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:16.370
 and just cook television Well here's how 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:20.479
 It said the trick was successful TV Weld 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:25.090
 some 3 who you need to give them 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:28.840
 car coin close film lyre 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.460
 Work will be much less 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.860
 make everything much easier for him 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.860
 it only remains to paint the seams 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:54.430
 welds separately to under the wing bumper 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:59.200
 bought color in color he is a story about 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.500

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.500
 tv
