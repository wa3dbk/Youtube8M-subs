00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.080
 today 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.710
 hello youtube friends today he talks to them his 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.840
 what ndr or louis millennium bringing them 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.850
 a new video analyzing the last 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.120
 game that will come out so far for 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.100
 the ps2 that is the fifa 14 but before 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.960
 start with the video I want to make a 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.570
 small comment about the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.400
 playstation 2 since it has undoubtedly 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.500
 been one of the best consoles in the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.870
 story having a good gallery of 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.030
 games a control that he simply had 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.160
 some improvements compared to the command 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.720
 of the original playstation is also a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.120
 multimedia team that can 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.010
 play movies and music in addition to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 be one of the most sold consoles with 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 more than 160 million consoles sold 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 worldwide and not for nothing remained 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.280
 with games even when their competitors 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.590
 they just focused on their consoles 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.200
 seventh generation and had enough 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.090
 to hold up to the eighth generation 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 only with that says a lot about a console 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 but let's move on to what really 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 came that is the analysis and criticism 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.810
 fifa 14 so with nothing more to say 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.140
 let's start a good time as we know 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 the fifa 14 is a soccer game 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 developed and distributed by the game 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 for ps consoles 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.509
 ps3 ps4 w3 psds pc 3ds xbox 360 and xbox 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.610
 band this game is not available for 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.189
 wii for the low sales of the console 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 in itself the mechanics of the game is simple 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.710
 which is to win championships either in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.990
 tournament mode or career mode unlocking 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 the alternative uniform stadiums 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.579
 official balls and celebrations that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 they are in the fan shop for 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.520
 fifa challenges through the game itself 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 has improvements for xbox360 consoles 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.149
 ps3 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.310
 ps4 and xbox band instead for the others 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 consoles is the legacy version that is 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.540
 the same game from last year including 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.420
 just an update of the equipment 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.400
 with the current shirts and templates 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.110
 at the same price as games with 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 improvements so it is not recommended 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.019
 buy the game if you already have the version 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.630
 2013 since it is the same because in itself if I 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.690
 put to compare the version of ps2 with 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.090
 the ps3's there is a big difference both 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.430
 graphically as in the gameplay and if 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.830
 I would still like to compare it with the ps4 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.780
 Well then just show 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.390
 or the clear difference between 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.760
 sixth seventh and eighth generation in a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 game something curious is that this game 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 achieved the feat of being so far the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.510
 only game to be released for consoles 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 of three different generations thing that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.590
 It is worthy to applaud itself version 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.050
 legacy is very different from the version 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.450
 normal from the game menu where in 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.450
 the legacy for the ps2 version looks a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.160
 Simple menu as seen in the fifa 2007 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.530
 and the version for the consoles of 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.720
 seventh generation is more structured and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.640
 more detailed without doubt and for 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.130
 eighth generation consoles only 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.230
 they see some small improvements although a 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.420
 little more elegant and then there's not much 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.459
 that analyze read the legacy version well 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.500
 let's move on to say the positive things 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.070
 and negatives of the game in my opinion 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 positive things I think the simple fact 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.840
 that the game comes out for ps2 and not 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.270
 for good is a very positive thing in 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.010
 yes but really happening to the subject I 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.170
 I think that if something should be highlighted 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.120
 game is its simple and practical way of 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.160
 play is to say you do not have to be a 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.200
 true video player to understand you 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.110
 and I tell you since I had not played 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 never fifa on ps2 and the first match will 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.250
 I understood very quickly the controls and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.380
 way of playing thing that with other fixed 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.690
 it did not happen to me and it took me a bit 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.790
 understand him I think that in itself is the only 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.310
 that I can stand out from the game because 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.530
 it's just a copy of the past fifa 13 like this 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.560
 that there are not many things to applaud 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.569
 negative things one of the things that I 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 Annoying is that this game has to 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.800
 commentators to the bermúdez dog and 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.320
 Ricardo Peláez instead of Fernando Palomo 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.060
 ciro procuna and mario alberto kempes and no 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 is that he has a problem with the dog and 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.200
 peláez but in itself the comments that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.930
 they are almost the same as they do in 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.090
 the fifa game 2006 what makes it boring 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.740
 and predictable what they will say besides that 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.110
 some comments they make are 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.760
 wrong as for example say that 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.919
 they removed the clean record to a 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.440
 goalkeeper when they had already scored a 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.360
 goal or exaggerating some goals by saying 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.810
 that were a great goal or things for the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.150
 style 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.669
 another thing that bothers me a lot of the fifa 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.890
 of ps 2 is the supposed hands that 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.690
 marks the referee every moment seriously is 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.730
 something that they do see you as by the simple 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.040
 fact that he hits his elbow is marked 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.080
 a hand that ruins the game a bit 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.030
 besides the added time that is given 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.490
 really if it bothers you in a match 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.440
 that you are losing by one goal only 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.300
 add a minute and in a match that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.310
 you earn as three goals 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.780
 difference add four is one 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.290
 foolishness without a doubt 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.510
 conclusion then fifa 14 for ps 2 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.880
 like the other legacy versions 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.100
 they are only a copy of the past fifa 13 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.380
 only with equipment and uniforms 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.660
 updated so if you already have the 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.700
 Last year's game is not recommended 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.130
 buy it in addition to being at the same 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.110
 price that fifa 13 when it came out at 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.110
 market so my recommendation is 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.300
 simple do not buy the fifa 14 for the ps 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.460
 2 if you already have a fifa game like 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.560
 than the other legacy version games 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.200
 as the graphics are the same 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.090
 same game modes in short is the same 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.820
 and if you wonder why I bought it 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.250
 it's simple I did not have fifa games for 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.220
 the ps2 so I decided to wait for 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.050
 buy the last game of ps 2 and well 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.720
 so far the video I hope you have them 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.730
 liked I know it was something short but good 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.620
 you can not criticize and analyze much 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.780
 to a game that is just a copy of it 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.910
 but hey I wanted to make this video because 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.790

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.950

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.900
 what to say

 see you in a next video until the 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.350
 next
