00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.610
 and I myself am already scared to look at 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.040
 themselves in the mirror let them kill us us 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.170
 nothing to lose we already died when 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.519
 President Obama sent us to prison 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.490
 indefinite time 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.400
 respect us or kill it your choice 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 the United States must reset the mask and kill us 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.669
 Here is my statement 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.009
 ward 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.429
 I met him a few days ago 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.789
 and was shocked by what he saw in less than 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:34.030
 month he lost 15 pounds he 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.640
 refused any food cheeks a fuse he 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.100
 barely kept on his feet for me this 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 there was a truly awful meeting and his 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.630
 statement respect us or kill 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.450
 listen to his face or he 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.610
 will now prepare for death think u 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.650
 many who turned out to be in perpetuity 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.380
 conclusion there is no hope 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.620
 because of the actions of the administration and many of 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.780
 I think they are ready for death 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.880
 the question is how and when will they die 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.100
 I do not expect to leave the prison and 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 it is very difficult for a person to live without 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.649
 hopes all prisoners in guantanamo 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.380
 indefinitely detained for 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.319
 freedom is not allowed out even if 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.090
 signed release documents but 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.429
 why so could you explain it 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.909
 After all, the United States should be legal 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.969
 cause 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.369
 justifying the conclusion of these people yes and 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.170
 the reason is very simple here you need 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.749
 remember first about the president 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.999
 us barrack obama and his broken 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.310
 promise this promise which he 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.859
 chose not to perform he says that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.929
 this is fault republicans in congress on 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.060
 there is no administration today 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.789
 one person to whom I could turn 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.249
 with this problem throughout the administration 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.039
 Obama there is no one to whom I could call 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:57.009
 and say this hunger strike needs to be stopped 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.409
 these prisoners are animals and we are 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.719
 should see them as people and respect them and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.849
 I don't want any of them to die 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.950
 because of this protest or because 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.530
 any other 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.679
 enough to keep people in limbo 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.230
 they have already reached extreme features if 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.180
 hunger strike will not end the question will not 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.940
 whether people will start dying 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.650
 but when they start dying of course 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 then it will be given more 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.019
 attention but humanly i'm not 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.300
 I want my charges to die and them 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.610
 current state for me the most 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.120
 sad sight for my whole lawyer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.120
 career
