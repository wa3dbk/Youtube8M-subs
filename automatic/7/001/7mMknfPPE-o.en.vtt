 the care with which you often have to have cloned 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.300
 all without losing 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.160
 today as in the past the art of curing and put to a large extent in the prescription of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.200
 medicines 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.450
 When a patient has consulted a doctor, it is possible that he may be 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 finances and of the office with a prescription the deficit or of scenario of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.280
 pharmaceutical specialties

 he wants to ask questions of the doctors 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.979
 this book contains the list of all medicines as the effects 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.389
 secondary to all day

 the medical student after a few years of study against his test he 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:20.049
 overcomes a decisive stage I finally have the power to heal 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.699
 Today's medicines are no longer linked to superstition and 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.700
 before it was very different 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.069
 the time of henrique 8ยบ offer a doctor in which he presented his 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.810

 orientation lament 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.329
 it was not later the medication like this relieving the groups what I did 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.659
 inside the patient 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.809
 the same thing happens with benedettini only who knows is that at the beginning in order to reap 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:02.349
 the medicine distilled by hands their mission of course was to save souls more 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.469
 also to entice the rooms and he presented his precious cholera 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.089
 patients with digestive problems that have respiratory problems 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.939
 all in september 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.279
 although doctors of the past have actually found effective remedies 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.029
 for various diseases 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.059
 all are interned in positions of position and have classification of 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.600
 scratchs 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.200
 was deprecated as soon as they knew the normal physiology of the human body 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.170
 none of the mechanisms of the disease and even less the action of the drug 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.709
 fortunately today is no longer so the mark pingo 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.169
 medicine consumed in the world when we take 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.169
 effect of each tablet we take 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.179
 1 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.999
 the same 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:58.659
 which brand the western countries and each two people 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.499
 even with the appeal - that consumes the medicine every two days 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.840
 with aspirin a sedative a tranquilizer does not fear the risk 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.049
 the law that prolongs throughout our college our lady soft 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.639
 be it over-the-counter or mandatory prescription drugs 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.569
 but how do these drugs work with tractors and diseases 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.609
 the drug is a chemical substance that has therapeutic action 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.210
 may relieve symptoms 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 to mitigate an illness 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:31.939
 looking for bronchitis 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:32.890
 to sleep 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.550
 to calm the pain 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.909
 depends on its chemical structure 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.469
 this structure conditioned the flow of the drug into the organism 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.710
 let's look at the case of aspirin when perceiving the medicines 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.090
 which has the acetylsalicylic trawl as the active substance 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.509
 their world consumption are different brands 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.509
 is estimated at 100 billion tablets per year 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.870
 like most medications the aspirin pill increases 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.769
 then goes to the stomach where it begins to dissolve 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.300
 there against its first obstacle 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.800
 the severe stomach ache 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.690
 fortunately the chemical nature of aspirin allows it to 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.690
 which does not occur with all medicines 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.660
 insulin for example must be injected into the muscles 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.370
 because yes that transited through the stomach would be totally inactive 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.889
 then the aspirin goes to the intestine 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.410
 then the blood passes 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.410
 which is distributed throughout the body in less than a minute 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.020
 so aspirin will be found both the organs in which it must produce 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.020
 its effect as in those who are not warned 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.770
 irrespective of how they are administered by the mouth 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.020
 injecting or by other means most of the drugs are absorbed by the 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.530
 blood 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.740
 which ensures its distribution throughout the body 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.990
 only some medicines have local action such as eye 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.990
 slaps on the leg 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.900
 aspirin decreases pain and fever and at higher doses attenuates certain 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.610
 information 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.930
 it has already prevented the body from synthesizing prostaglandins 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.020
 chemical substances responsible for this 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.240
 when we burn for example we feel immensely a living pain 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.080
 caused by contact with the heat source which then appears to us 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.430
 a few moments 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.650
 but quickly the pain returns because the body reacts producing 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.650
 prostaglandins in the burn region 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.539
 with fever 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.659
 it results from the presence of prostaglandins at the level of the hypothalamus 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.479
 the total now a part of the brain that serves as thermostat human body 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:11.129
 a high concentration of prostaglandins has the effect of activating 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.449
 thermostat raising the body temperature 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.800
 not that this process can be caused for example 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.800
 by the entry of a microbe in the organism 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.069
 inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins aspirin relieves the pain that these 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.759
 substances provoke 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.879
 aspirin while it remains in the body or 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.879
 for a few hours 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:39.360
 with the absorption of the drug the body passes defending against this 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.459
 foreign body triggers a series of mechanisms to transform the 

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.459
 invader 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.379
 the liver play an important role in this process 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:54.209
 is the organ with several aspirin molecules are transformed and then 

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:56.149
 excreted by theirs 

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:59.329
 but it is mainly in the kidneys that aspirin like any other medium
