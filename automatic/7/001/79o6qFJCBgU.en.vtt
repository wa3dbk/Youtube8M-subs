we've<00:00:05.970> got<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.149> pretty<00:00:06.390> big<00:00:06.629> engines<00:00:06.960> here

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we've got a pretty big engines here

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.140 
we've got a pretty big engines here
behind<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.219> you<00:00:08.340> tell<00:00:08.730> us<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.910> little<00:00:09.030> bit

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
behind you can you tell us a little bit

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.000 
behind you can you tell us a little bit
about<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.660> alright<00:00:10.379> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.709> truck

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
about that alright this is a truck

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.299 
about that alright this is a truck
installation<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.309> pretty

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
installation here it's it's pretty

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.249 
installation here it's it's pretty
obvious<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.089> has<00:00:15.210> no<00:00:15.389> transmission<00:00:16.110> or

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
obvious that it has no transmission or

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.589 
obvious that it has no transmission or
doesn't<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> radiator<00:00:17.450> doesn't<00:00:18.450> have<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
doesn't have a radiator doesn't have a

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.480 
doesn't have a radiator doesn't have a
muffler<00:00:18.990> doesn't<00:00:19.860> have<00:00:19.980> catalytic

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
muffler doesn't have catalytic

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.130 
muffler doesn't have catalytic
converters<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.240> doesn't<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.630> filter<00:00:21.990> traps

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
converters and doesn't have filter traps

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.470 
converters and doesn't have filter traps
and<00:00:23.070> you'll<00:00:23.220> also<00:00:23.400> notice<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.000> doesn't<00:00:24.330> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and you'll also notice it doesn't have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
and you'll also notice it doesn't have
oil<00:00:24.900> filters<00:00:25.410> because<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.890> doesn't<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.220> oil

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
oil filters because it doesn't have oil

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
oil filters because it doesn't have oil
in<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> never<00:00:27.119> needs<00:00:27.269> an<00:00:27.449> oil<00:00:27.539> change<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
in it never needs an oil change it's a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
in it never needs an oil change it's a
closed-loop<00:00:29.130> system<00:00:29.670> similar<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
closed-loop system similar to the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.119 
closed-loop system similar to the
refrigerator<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.590> house<00:00:31.769> that's<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
refrigerator in your house that's a

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.710 
refrigerator in your house that's a
closed-loop<00:00:32.489> system<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.059> never<00:00:33.239> change<00:00:33.540> oil

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
closed-loop system you never change oil

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.380 
closed-loop system you never change oil
so<00:00:34.650> this<00:00:34.949> engine<00:00:35.280> operates<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.790> deionized

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so this engine operates on deionized

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
so this engine operates on deionized
water<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> working<00:00:37.500> fluid<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
water is the working fluid and the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.330 
water is the working fluid and the
lubrication<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> engine<00:00:40.410> has<00:00:40.680> its<00:00:40.980> full

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
lubrication the engine has its full

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.209 
lubrication the engine has its full
torque<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.210> hour<00:00:42.360> p.m.<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.620> stops

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
torque at one hour p.m. so it's stops

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
torque at one hour p.m. so it's stops
and<00:00:44.460> starts<00:00:44.670> runs<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> engine<00:00:45.690> itself<00:00:45.809> will

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and starts runs the engine itself will

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.970 
and starts runs the engine itself will
run<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> reverse<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:49.829> an

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
run in reverse and it it has an

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
run in reverse and it it has an
extremely<00:00:50.610> clean<00:00:51.030> exhaust<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.350> burns

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
extremely clean exhaust because it burns

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.850 
extremely clean exhaust because it burns
fuel<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> centrifuge<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> circle

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
fuel in the centrifuge and in a circle

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
fuel in the centrifuge and in a circle
and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> long<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.570> long<00:00:57.750> flame

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and it has a long time in a long flame

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
and it has a long time in a long flame
front<00:00:58.410> where<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:58.620> internal<00:00:59.010> combustion

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
front where an internal combustion

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.970 
front where an internal combustion
engine<00:00:59.760> has<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.059> extremely<00:01:00.390> fast<00:01:00.840> burn<00:01:01.649> time

engine has an extremely fast burn time
one<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> reasons<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
one of the reasons they have to have a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.389 
one of the reasons they have to have a
catalytic<00:01:04.470> converter<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.220> actually

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
catalytic converter and they actually

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.279 
catalytic converter and they actually
burn<00:01:05.729> fuel<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.240> catalytic<00:01:06.600> converter<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
burn fuel in the catalytic converter to

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.600 
burn fuel in the catalytic converter to
burn<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.770> rest<00:01:08.009> of<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.250> unburned

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
burn up the rest of the unburned

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.089 
burn up the rest of the unburned
hydrocarbons<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.080> course<00:01:10.289> an<00:01:10.500> internal

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:11.099 
hydrocarbons and of course an internal

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:12.680 
hydrocarbons and of course an internal
combustion<00:01:11.550> engine<00:01:11.849> is<00:01:11.970> never<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.539> be<00:01:12.660> a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
combustion engine is never going to be a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.419 
combustion engine is never going to be a
clean<00:01:12.959> engine<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.099> to<00:01:14.250> fire

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
clean engine because it has to fire

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.249 
clean engine because it has to fire
under<00:01:14.819> high<00:01:14.940> pressures<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.599> high

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
under high pressures and high

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.839 
under high pressures and high
temperatures<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.920> both<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.789> things

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:17.849 
temperatures in both of those things

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:20.300 
temperatures in both of those things
cause<00:01:18.660> some<00:01:18.929> pretty<00:01:19.140> obnoxious<00:01:19.319> gases<00:01:20.160> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
cause some pretty obnoxious gases and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
cause some pretty obnoxious gases and
carbon<00:01:20.729> monoxides<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.599> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.920> nitrous

carbon monoxides in the in the nitrous

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
carbon monoxides in the in the nitrous
oxide<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.550> is<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:23.880> bad<00:01:24.149> it<00:01:24.360> doesn't

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
oxide which is pretty bad it doesn't

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
oxide which is pretty bad it doesn't
break<00:01:24.780> down<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:25.349> well<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> course<00:01:26.910> even

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
break down very well and of course even

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.820 
break down very well and of course even
the<00:01:27.450> exhaust<00:01:27.780> temperature<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.410> much<00:01:28.590> cooler

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
the exhaust temperature is much cooler

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.559 
the exhaust temperature is much cooler
than<00:01:29.130> an<00:01:29.280> internal<00:01:29.700> combustion<00:01:30.000> engine<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
than an internal combustion engine you

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:31.969 
than an internal combustion engine you
can<00:01:30.690> put<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.959> hand<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.319> this<00:01:31.470> engine<00:01:31.709> what

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
can put your hand on this engine what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
can put your hand on this engine what
it's<00:01:32.130> running<00:01:32.750> they're<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.959> very<00:01:34.110> smooth

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it's running they're very very smooth

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's running they're very very smooth
and<00:01:34.709> the<00:01:35.190> main<00:01:35.550> thing<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.789> is<00:01:36.090> they're<00:01:36.239> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and the main thing is is they're so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.150 
and the main thing is is they're so
simple<00:01:36.660> they're<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.959> very<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.470> simple<00:01:37.739> engine

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
simple they're a very very simple engine

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.779 
simple they're a very very simple engine
they<00:01:38.729> appear<00:01:39.660> to<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.929> little<00:01:40.170> complex

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
they appear to be a little complex

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.609 
they appear to be a little complex
thermodynamically<00:01:41.899> because<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.080> move<00:01:43.319> a<00:01:43.440> lot

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
thermodynamically because we move a lot

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.880 
thermodynamically because we move a lot
of<00:01:44.030> air<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.599> forth<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.530> heat

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of air back and forth for heat

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.279

regeneration<00:01:47.429> as<00:01:47.789> they<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> power<00:01:48.989> plant

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
regeneration as they do in a power plant

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.699 
regeneration as they do in a power plant
so<00:01:50.069> we're<00:01:50.539> saving<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.660> energy<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.140> because

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
so we're saving that energy and because

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:53.900 
so we're saving that energy and because
of<00:01:52.739> that<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.459> eight<00:01:53.580> percent

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
of that we can get an eight percent

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.669 
of that we can get an eight percent
right<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.300> top<00:01:54.569> of<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:54.840> thermal<00:01:55.170> efficiency

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
right on top of the thermal efficiency

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.249 
right on top of the thermal efficiency
of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> engine<00:01:56.039> itself<00:01:56.459> so<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.390> uses<00:01:57.569> steam<00:01:57.989> as

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
of the engine itself so it uses steam as

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
of the engine itself so it uses steam as
a<00:01:58.289> working<00:01:58.679> fluid<00:01:59.009> yeah<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.489> doesn't<00:01:59.640> turn

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
a working fluid yeah it doesn't turn

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240 
a working fluid yeah it doesn't turn
into<00:02:00.060> steam<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.929> we<00:02:01.739> don't<00:02:01.860> call<00:02:02.069> it<00:02:02.129> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
into steam in the in we don't call it a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.830 
into steam in the in we don't call it a
boiler<00:02:02.580> it's<00:02:02.789> not<00:02:02.940> it's<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.270> heat<00:02:03.390> exchanger

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
boiler it's not it's a heat exchanger

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.449 
boiler it's not it's a heat exchanger
because<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.229> doesn't<00:02:04.530> boil<00:02:04.709> water<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.129> their

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
because it doesn't boil water in their

until<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> expands<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> top<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
until it expands on the top of the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.320 
until it expands on the top of the
piston<00:02:13.550> but<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> goes<00:02:14.820> through<00:02:15.090> compression

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
piston but it goes through compression

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510 
piston but it goes through compression
Chay's<00:02:16.510> changed<00:02:17.170> phases<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.890> RPMs

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
Chay's changed phases as the RPMs

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.870 
Chay's changed phases as the RPMs
increase<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:20.590> rpm<00:02:21.070> where<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.520> has<00:02:21.670> its

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
increase at one rpm where it has its

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.610 
increase at one rpm where it has its
most<00:02:22.120> torque<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.690> engine<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.020> run<00:02:23.230> forward

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
most torque the engine can run forward

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.700 
most torque the engine can run forward
and<00:02:23.740> backwards<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.390> has<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.530> high

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
and backwards but it has that high

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.740 
and backwards but it has that high
torque<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.250> as<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.490> RPMs<00:02:27.940> increase<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.570> use

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
torque but as the RPMs increase you use

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.480 
torque but as the RPMs increase you use
the<00:02:28.930> inertia<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.650> piston<00:02:30.040> for

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
the inertia of the piston for

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.400 
the inertia of the piston for
compression<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.510> recompress<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
compression and you recompress the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.800 
compression and you recompress the
residual<00:02:32.920> what's<00:02:33.190> left<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.610> there<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
residual what's left in there and it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.660 
residual what's left in there and it
increases<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.470> thermodynamic<00:02:36.280> cycle

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
increases the thermodynamic cycle

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.060 
increases the thermodynamic cycle
because<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.120> raises<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.960> temperature<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.710> the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
because it raises the temperature on the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.490 
because it raises the temperature on the
top<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> piston<00:02:39.730> at<00:02:40.570> lower<00:02:40.870> speeds<00:02:41.260> we

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
top of the piston at lower speeds we

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.170 
top of the piston at lower speeds we
take<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> compression<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.640> run<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.970> back

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
take the compression and run it back

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.150 
take the compression and run it back
into<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.690> combustion<00:02:44.050> chamber<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> reheat

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
into the combustion chamber for a reheat

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.670 
into the combustion chamber for a reheat
stage<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.210> keeps<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.660> at<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.260> high

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
stage and that keeps it at a high

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.730 
stage and that keeps it at a high
thermodynamic<00:02:48.580> cycle<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.320> engine<00:02:50.590> goes

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
thermodynamic cycle so the engine goes

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.560 
thermodynamic cycle so the engine goes
through<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> lot<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.370> thermal<00:02:51.700> dynamic<00:02:52.090> changes

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
through a lot of thermal dynamic changes

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.780 
through a lot of thermal dynamic changes
however<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.590> machine<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.070> very<00:02:54.250> simple<00:02:54.550> it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
however the machine is very simple it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.970 
however the machine is very simple it
only<00:02:54.940> has<00:02:55.150> six<00:02:55.420> valves<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.080> six<00:02:56.740> little

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
only has six valves in it six little

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.860 
only has six valves in it six little
Pistons<00:02:57.400> which<00:02:57.700> are<00:02:57.850> very<00:02:57.970> small<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
Pistons which are very small because the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.920 
Pistons which are very small because the
pressures<00:02:59.260> are<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.590> high<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.480> know<00:03:01.600> it's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
pressures are so high and you know it's

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.300 
pressures are so high and you know it's
not<00:03:02.050> using<00:03:02.410> half<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.770> engine<00:03:03.070> for<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
not using half the engine for a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.190 
not using half the engine for a
compressor<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> gasoline<00:03:04.690> engine<00:03:04.810> does

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
compressor like a gasoline engine does

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.650 
compressor like a gasoline engine does
it<00:03:05.230> only<00:03:06.040> has<00:03:06.220> basically<00:03:06.670> two<00:03:06.940> main<00:03:07.209> bearings

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
it only has basically two main bearings

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.000 
it only has basically two main bearings
in<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.170> simple<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.680> back<00:03:08.860> to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
in it so it's simple it's back to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.490 
in it so it's simple it's back to
simplicity<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:10.240> your<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.840> old<00:03:11.020> car<00:03:11.290> would

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
simplicity like your your old car would

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.930 
simplicity like your your old car would
look<00:03:11.680> when<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> open<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> hood<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> look

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
look when you open the hood and you look

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.400 
look when you open the hood and you look
down<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> ground<00:03:14.080> around

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
down and you can see the ground around

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.070 
down and you can see the ground around
it<00:03:14.650> well<00:03:15.190> that's<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.490> complete<00:03:15.760> engine<00:03:16.240> it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
it well that's the complete engine it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.050 
it well that's the complete engine it
doesn't<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.620> all<00:03:17.650> those<00:03:17.950> accessories<00:03:18.370> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
doesn't have all those accessories so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.430 
doesn't have all those accessories so
what's<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.330> efficiency<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.900> something<00:03:20.290> like

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
what's the efficiency of something like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.410 
what's the efficiency of something like
this<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> thirty<00:03:21.730> percent<00:03:22.150> range

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
this it's in the thirty percent range

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.050 
this it's in the thirty percent range
plus<00:03:23.050> we've<00:03:23.860> got<00:03:24.040> some<00:03:24.220> performance<00:03:24.790> curves

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
plus we've got some performance curves

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.850 
plus we've got some performance curves
here<00:03:25.300> can<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.600> take<00:03:25.810> us<00:03:25.840> through<00:03:25.959> them<00:03:26.290> ok

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860

this<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.580> torque<00:03:28.090> curve<00:03:28.269> diagram<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
this is the torque curve diagram of the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.490 
this is the torque curve diagram of the
330<00:03:30.040> horsepower<00:03:30.160> truck<00:03:30.850> engine<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:32.080> as<00:03:32.380> you

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
330 horsepower truck engine it's as you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.930 
330 horsepower truck engine it's as you
can<00:03:32.680> see<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.400> torque<00:03:33.640> in<00:03:33.790> this

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
can see this is the torque in this

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.720 
can see this is the torque in this
direction<00:03:34.090> rpms<00:03:35.050> here<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.830> has<00:03:36.040> an<00:03:36.220> extremely

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
direction rpms here it has an extremely

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.420 
direction rpms here it has an extremely
high<00:03:36.880> starting<00:03:37.630> torque<00:03:37.660> at<00:03:38.050> one<00:03:38.200> rpm<00:03:38.709> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
high starting torque at one rpm the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.100 
high starting torque at one rpm the
engine<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:40.090> course<00:03:40.269> can<00:03:40.450> run<00:03:40.600> forward<00:03:40.989> and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
engine can of course can run forward and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.449 
engine can of course can run forward and
backwards<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.769> course<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> torque<00:03:42.280> curve

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
backwards and of course the torque curve

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.420 
backwards and of course the torque curve
flattens<00:03:42.940> out<00:03:43.180> as<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> RPMs<00:03:44.260> increase<00:03:44.709> for<00:03:45.340> an

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
flattens out as a RPMs increase for an

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.949 
flattens out as a RPMs increase for an
internal<00:03:45.790> combustion<00:03:46.120> engine<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.690> high

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
internal combustion engine the high

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.660 
internal combustion engine the high
torque<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.440> at<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.709> wrong<00:03:47.860> end<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.280> engine

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
torque is at the wrong end of the engine

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.340 
torque is at the wrong end of the engine
that's<00:03:49.150> why<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.750> go<00:03:49.840> through<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.110> gear

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
that's why you have to go through a gear

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.020 
that's why you have to go through a gear
change<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.830> convert<00:03:51.160> horsepower<00:03:51.610> back<00:03:51.880> to

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
change a convert horsepower back to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.020 
change a convert horsepower back to
torque<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:53.350> what<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.010> do<00:03:54.160> here<00:03:54.519> this<00:03:54.730> engine

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
torque so what we do here this engine

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.370 
torque so what we do here this engine
has<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.330> highest<00:03:55.570> torque<00:03:55.930> here<00:03:56.170> and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
has this highest torque here and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.150 
has this highest torque here and
flattens<00:03:56.830> out<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.370> an<00:03:57.970> electric<00:03:58.360> motor<00:03:58.510> would

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
flattens out as an electric motor would

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.580 
flattens out as an electric motor would
so<00:04:00.160> at<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:01.060> stoplight<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.930> engine<00:04:02.170> doesn't<00:04:02.290> run

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
so at a stoplight the engine doesn't run

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.710 
so at a stoplight the engine doesn't run
so<00:04:02.860> you're<00:04:03.130> not<00:04:03.220> expelling<00:04:03.640> fuel<00:04:04.000> only<00:04:04.690> a

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
so you're not expelling fuel only a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.350 
so you're not expelling fuel only a
minor<00:04:05.230> amount<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:06.250> take<00:04:06.610> up<00:04:06.790> any<00:04:06.940> thermal

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
minor amount to take up any thermal

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.150 
minor amount to take up any thermal
losses<00:04:07.540> through<00:04:07.959> insulation<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.890> forth

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
losses through insulation and so forth

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.490 
losses through insulation and so forth
the<00:04:09.730> secondary<00:04:10.239> torque<00:04:10.570> curve<00:04:10.780> over<00:04:10.989> here<00:04:11.350> is

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
the secondary torque curve over here is

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.800 
the secondary torque curve over here is
as<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.190> sits<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.640> while<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.120> builds<00:04:13.480> up<00:04:13.690> a

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
as it sits for a while it builds up a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.570 
as it sits for a while it builds up a
little<00:04:14.049> latent<00:04:14.380> heat<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:15.220> can<00:04:15.400> get<00:04:15.519> a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
little latent heat and you can get a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.120 
little latent heat and you can get a
real<00:04:16.269> high<00:04:16.450> burst<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.930> acceleration<00:04:17.200> like

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
real high burst of acceleration like

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.890 
real high burst of acceleration like
every<00:04:18.790> so<00:04:18.970> many<00:04:19.030> minutes<00:04:19.450> that<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:19.720> would

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
every so many minutes that you would

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.740 
every so many minutes that you would
stop<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.549> normal<00:04:21.729> operation<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.570> have

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
stop but in normal operation you have

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.160 
stop but in normal operation you have
enough<00:04:23.020> acceleration<00:04:23.740> to

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
enough acceleration to

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.110 
enough acceleration to
to<00:04:24.590> pull<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.890> pretty<00:04:25.400> good<00:04:25.610> load<00:04:25.790> without

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to pull a pretty good load without

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.810 
to pull a pretty good load without
having<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> big<00:04:27.440> transmission<00:04:28.070> now<00:04:28.670> of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
having to have a big transmission now of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.460 
having to have a big transmission now of
course<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.570> doesn't<00:04:29.870> have<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.020> radiator

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
course the it doesn't have a radiator

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.260 
course the it doesn't have a radiator
because<00:04:30.770> we<00:04:31.100> use<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.580> heat<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:32.030> would<00:04:32.120> be

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
because we use that heat that would be

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.180 
because we use that heat that would be
normally<00:04:32.690> blown<00:04:32.930> off<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.380> radiator<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.950> an

normally blown off of a radiator of an
automobile<00:04:34.760> we<00:04:35.390> take<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.840> heat<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.530> runs

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
automobile we take that heat and it runs

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.680 
automobile we take that heat and it runs
around<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.400> heat<00:04:37.640> exchanger<00:04:38.150> where<00:04:38.540> this

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
around a heat exchanger where this
