00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
like the first ability where you can tap

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
like the first ability where you can tap
at<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.850> grim<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.600> tap<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.049> side

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
at a grim than then on tap at side

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.169 
at a grim than then on tap at side
permanent<00:00:55.769> which<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.459> course<00:00:56.489> means<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
permanent which of course means that you

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.139 
permanent which of course means that you
can<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.929> tap<00:00:58.139> your<00:00:58.319> opponent's

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
can you can tap your opponent's

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.189 
can you can tap your opponent's
permanent<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.269> then<00:01:00.389> on<00:01:00.539> top<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.019> your

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
permanent and then on top one of your

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
permanent and then on top one of your
own<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.679> defend<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.339> which<00:01:02.909> is<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.209> good

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
own to defend with which is really good

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.560 
own to defend with which is really good
control<00:01:03.749> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.190> think<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
control I think and I also think that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
control I think and I also think that
that<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.050> log<00:01:07.290> comes<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.370> do<00:01:08.490> three<00:01:08.790> diamonds

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that to log comes to do three diamonds

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
that to log comes to do three diamonds
is<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.420> nice<00:01:09.570> especially<00:01:10.230> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is really nice especially if you have a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.040 
is really nice especially if you have a
lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> loyal<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.330> countless<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.870> just

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
lot of loyal to countless you can just

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.310 
lot of loyal to countless you can just
do<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.670> one<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.910> walk<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:15.780> their<00:01:16.110> one

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
do this one and walk more than their one

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
do this one and walk more than their one
once<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:18.030> turn<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.480> think<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
once in the in one turn so I think that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
once in the in one turn so I think that
can<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.260> really<00:01:19.530> dangerous<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> opponent

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
can be really dangerous to the opponent

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850 
can be really dangerous to the opponent
if<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:21.000> doesn't<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:22.050> anything<00:01:22.440> about<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
if he doesn't do anything about this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
if he doesn't do anything about this
planeswalker<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:24.480> I<00:01:24.540> said<00:01:24.780> before<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.080> think

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
planeswalker as I said before I think

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.830 
planeswalker as I said before I think
the<00:01:25.440> ultimate<00:01:25.860> seems<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:27.000> random<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.690> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the ultimate seems a bit random for this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.470 
the ultimate seems a bit random for this
but<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.830> course<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> always<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:30.030> extra

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
but of course is always nice with extra

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.170 
but of course is always nice with extra
turns<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.800> get<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.160> rights<00:01:32.370> coin<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
turns if you get the rights coin of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
turns if you get the rights coin of
course<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.260> all<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.620> all<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> really

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
course but they all in all I really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.610 
course but they all in all I really
think<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.910> this<00:01:36.810> brains<00:01:37.050> for<00:01:37.260> gets<00:01:37.470> real

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
think this this brains for gets real

the battlefield is turn your metrocard
then<00:03:50.110> with<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.830> call<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.310> believe<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.110> you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
then with the call I believe to you you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.370 
then with the call I believe to you you
actually<00:03:53.290> draw<00:03:53.800> four<00:03:54.370> cards<00:03:54.730> at<00:03:54.850> gate<00:03:55.030> four

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
actually draw four cards at gate four

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.800

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.480 
White's a bit critter turns out on the
battlefield<00:03:58.960> so<00:03:59.380> that's<00:03:59.560> actually<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.070> really

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
battlefield so that's actually a really

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.480 
battlefield so that's actually a really
good<00:04:00.730> term<00:04:01.090> for<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:02.290> again<00:04:02.800> eight<00:04:03.280> men

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
good term for you but again eight men

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.390 
good term for you but again eight men
and<00:04:03.520> maybe<00:04:04.120> quite<00:04:04.570> a<00:04:04.630> lot<00:04:04.840> for<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:06.370> this

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
and maybe quite a lot for this for this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.820 
and maybe quite a lot for this for this
cat<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.970> would<00:04:07.360> most<00:04:07.570> likely<00:04:07.870> use<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.470> for<00:04:08.710> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
cat I would most likely use it for the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.160 
cat I would most likely use it for the
for<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.220> big<00:04:09.400> one<00:04:09.580> but<00:04:10.090> then<00:04:10.270> but<00:04:10.960> they<00:04:11.080> are

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
for the big one but then but they are

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.980 
for the big one but then but they are
thinking<00:04:11.410> in<00:04:11.680> general<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:12.190> an<00:04:12.340> okay<00:04:12.640> cut

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
thinking in general it's an okay cut

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.210 
thinking in general it's an okay cut
it's<00:04:13.990> nice<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.350> see<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.530> return<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:14.980> spread

it's nice to see you return on spread
cast<00:04:15.490> basically<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.239> fuse<00:04:16.720> mechanic

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
cast basically with this fuse mechanic

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.100 
cast basically with this fuse mechanic
we<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.520> make<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:18.700> make<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.690> thick<00:04:19.930> with

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
we like to make a make it thick with

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.860 
we like to make a make it thick with
this<00:04:20.230> basically<00:04:20.560> because<00:04:20.890> there<00:04:21.070> are<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.190> much

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
this basically because there are so much

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.300 
this basically because there are so much
combos<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.860> different

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
combos with this and the different

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.920 
combos with this and the different
colors<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.510> would<00:04:25.780> be

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
colors and so on so I think it would be

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.300 
colors and so on so I think it would be
really<00:04:26.050> interesting<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.590> make<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.980> thick<00:04:27.160> with

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
really interesting to make it thick with

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.820 
really interesting to make it thick with
it<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:28.090> purity<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.510> aqua<00:04:28.840> tells<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.410> 22
