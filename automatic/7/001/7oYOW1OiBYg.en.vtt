00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.300
 I've already done that twice 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.119
 and whenever I enter myself 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.650

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.199
 is quite easy to make and 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.239
 tastes easy and that's how I felt 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.190
 now with these peanut butter bars or 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.290
 Peanut biscuit rules 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.320
 they are so easy to make and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.850
 They really taste great and like them 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.450
 I want you to do that today 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.920
 show a lot of fun and watch here 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.170
 Do you see already known ingredients 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.700
 he needs that one once 200 grams 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.380
 butter biscuits I'm perfect here 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 butter biscuits maybe taken one 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.480
 bad conscience a bit too 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.520
 soothe 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.330
 You can also use normal butter biscuits 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.600
 use 150 grams of butter 150 grams 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.410
 icing sugar 200 grams of peanut butter the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.149
 atmos cream should not be a bit 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.190
 include because if you have the rules 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.320
 cuts you down easier 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.070
 if there are so many cars in it 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.470
 are and 300 grams of chocolate I have 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.790
 now here half did bitter and to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.710
 half full taken me 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.439
 you can do it according to your taste 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.350
 mission first, now seek you one 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.790
 form casserole go there quite well 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.500
 with all the disadvantages so easy 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.930
 rounded corners and therefore the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.119
 lock the one on the edge afterwards 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.950
 not so beautiful tailoring at right angles 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.409
 but he does not because taste 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.790
 Cancel what can take good 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.340
 or whatever I always take this is mine 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.750
 procedure have my cake plate here 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.490
 as a base weather outside baking paper 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.409
 and then I put my stuff on it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.610
 I now have a size of 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.869
 27 on 27 cm set the first 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.180
 step is now that the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.680
 butter biscuits would have to displace very fine 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.390
 that could do that now 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.390
 it filled the interior door 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.770
 if he's such a tip here like me 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.610
 You could just have it closed 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.800
 close 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.260
 otherwise he also needs a whole 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.950
 simple fastening clip and then 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.819
 the whole thing with the wood if very fine 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.489
 crumbly become very strong mixa too 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.200
 home has, for example, in the thermomix 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.660
 Of course he can do that too 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.569
 make mixer and almost fast mail 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.890
 my butter biscuit crumbles like crumble 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.739
 I have to put in a bowl now 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.570
 and I'll give that one now 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.100
 powdered sugar 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.050
 By now I have butter and the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.470
 agnes cream in the microwave something 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.090
 heated and the two ingredients I give 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:01.670
 Now for this butteriek powdered sugar 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:06.739
 mix and now I miss this 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.810
 ingredients to a single mass and 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.610
 who at the beginning of the butter biscuits with a 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.580
 four crumbles can of course 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.430
 all other ingredients just then in 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.320
 Add the mixer and there together 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.019
 then it can be stirred by hand 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.360
 Of course, stir and save these 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.280
 Mass felt now in euro 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.049
 shape 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.640
 now the mass is painting in the form 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.140
 nice and smooth and puts it for a 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.730
 half hour per hour in the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.730
 fridge so that it can become firm 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.620
 so and just before your biscuit floor now 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.450
 from the refrigerator brings could 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.090
 chocolate ever could quickly 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.329
 Once in a water bath or I do 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.859
 that likes to have it in the microwave oven 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.989
 your your microwave oven a bit 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.880
 I know there are always half 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.190
 my maximum performance 1 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.859
 that's 350 watts for me and leave it there 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.040
 I then put the chocolate for two minutes 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.049
 melt 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.820
 and that's how the chocolate looks now 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.799
 turn two minutes in the micro stand 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.549
 when he sees it already nice 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.910
 molten 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.370
 I'll mix it up nicely now and then 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.200
 again for ten minutes to clean 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.829
 ask and you know if that 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.540
 chocolate is melted too hot that 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.430
 he then when they became solid afterwards 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.530
 is a greyish and gets that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.330
 I will avoid it that way 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.170
 that I am the last solid 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.030
 chocolate chips 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.250
 just want to stir it up 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.780
 Melt get like that and now would have to 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.090
 only your melted chocolate 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.020
 distribute on your floor 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.340
 and since that is pretty liquid flows 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:44.500
 actually by itself 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.150
 just this folder this whole sheet metal 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.800
 always tilt to the side and the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.920
 chocolate nicely on the edge 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.200
 but still help a little 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.980
 I also do not want to spatel or 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.820
 Distribute the whole with the parking disc 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.010
 if so nice now 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.780
 have uniform chocolate mirror 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.720
 then you are just still 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.490
 Let cool or let it solidify 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.290
 that could be done by doing that 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.670
 just leave everything in the room 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.040
 Of course, it takes a bit longer 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.050
 who is impatient to have it faster 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.030
 I would like to put the whole thing in refrigerator 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.000
 there you just have to be careful that the you 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.730
 Chocolate will not be because then 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.680
 break the whole rule after the seminar 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.780
 or a piece I had that cuts 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.760
 all hope now about 20 minutes in the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.700
 fridge and now I remove 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.710
 my frame and i will get that 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.240
 whole now in free on 13 meters large 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.820
 Cut the dice I'm doing now 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.100
 I always up here at 3 cm 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.030
 put a mark on it and there too 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.130
 opposite side again and 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.700
 then I also take this cellar as 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.370
 linear quasi unattractive straight cut 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.050
 hinzubekommen 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.960
 At first , the chocolate just turns 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.300
 easy on 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.850
 and the second cut I press 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.650
 a bit deeper and you can too 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.650
 to take a really sharp knife 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.400
 These peanut butter bars or peanut 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.950
 King Street go right on the tongue 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.050
 and who the combination of chocolate 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.170
 I do not like opening and biscuits 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.390
 stop eating more and therefore stop 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.640
 They are also very nice 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.980
 packed as a refined gift idea 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.560
 as a present and I am already 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.720
 looking forward to your comments and how they 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.720
 you taste good and I would like me too 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.850
 happy if you visited me or in 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.890
 Stop by one of my last videos 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.780
 I'm definitely looking forward to it 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.780
 next time and said today
