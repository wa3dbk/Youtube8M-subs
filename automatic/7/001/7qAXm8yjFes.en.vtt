00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.690
 what is it like to be superman so 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.300
 a serious topic was often raised in games and 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.060
 no doubt more than once in the future 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.670
 raise crazy no shansky action 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.250
 prototyp at one time rummaged deeply 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.530
 in it all blazing helicopters fell on 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.240
 heads without a scary monster tanks 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.720
 burst under the blow of a fist 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.790
 the word new york has turned in from the main 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.690
 the hero was trying to fix something but how 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.160
 it is known from never ending therefore 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.840
 present to your attention the video 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.590
 preview of the game prototype 2 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.590
 on playground.ru 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 the final of the previous part was open it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.940
 left a number of problems 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.860
 unresolved and the second part 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.590
 will try to solve at least some of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 them so that the process proceeded fascinating 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 the main character will now not be Alex 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 mercer and old warrior 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.990
 and therefore even more controversial 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 the identity of James Heller planned 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.930
 sentimental vendetta which owes 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 raise the story to a new level 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.729
 the catch is that heller hates 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.640
 mercer namely ivan vi no wife death 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 and daughters that is his whole family and and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.160
 the truth just mowed the epidemic but 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 heller in deep sadness he needs someone 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.100
 then blame 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 at the first attempt to get revenge heller 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.890
 mercer infects it with a virus and so 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 way does too superhuman and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.210
 the plot of the second part disappears and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.490
 revolves around what is hiller 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.490
 hunts down mercer to kill him 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 the story begins 14 months later 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 after the events of the first prototype 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.550
 former New York divided into three zones 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 the red zone is where the hellish flames 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.870
 solid freaks where everything explodes blood 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.210
 flowing and just do not go there to walk in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.820
 the yellow zone is easier this is true black 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
 refugee territory of soldiers and scientists 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.450
 experimenters 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.490
 everything is evidence of a heavy piguet 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 my, well nearly 100 until 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.750
 there are many suspicious people here but 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.450
 it's easy to hide among them 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.760
 finally the green zone is practically 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 recreation area where everything is relative 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.860
 calm because it is full 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.150
 armed men 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.610
 zones will open gradually 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 there is it already so small but 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.440
 linearity the developers do it for 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.120
 order to improve the flow of history 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.220
 which tend to do more 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.860
 more interesting more developed 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.590
 dramatic than in the previous part 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.720
 In general, this is again a sandbox with a mass 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.120
 tasks as plot and collateral 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.340
 true side missions will be tied to the plot 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.410
 at least indirectly they can be taken 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 for example by gaining access to a secret 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.880
 information network black no logging in 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.820
 her you will see the information that the military 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.300
 or a scientist is preparing some kind of operation and 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.460
 urine brush and and undermine pleases that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.560
 developers noticeably pulled up the graphics 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.040
 Now the picture is more modern with 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.690
 a lot of effects almost sweetie yet 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.880
 the design of the locations are significant 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.620
 because each zone is more diverse 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.200
 in their own way each has their own stylistic 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.730
 features 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.360
 In addition, the developers have subjected 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.160
 changes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.350
 artificial intelligence will become harder 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.690
 stealth will appear a special mode for 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.000
 finding the right people in it heller will 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.890
 how to ping the terrain will change 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.620
 combat system it should turn out 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.780
 less chaotic but still colorful 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.940
 and dynamic outside even appear 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.880
 normal counterattack and dismemberment 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.890
 will become even more picturesque to the same 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.290
 authors completely redo pumping 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.360
 ability store will disappear from now on 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.180
 they will have to earn and use 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.580
 otherwise they will open as 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.250
 passing as well as bloody poses 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.250
 orgy that player can and should 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.340
 will periodically arrange 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.840
 special monsters dens planned 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.609
 limited number of cells for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.010
 abilities so you will need 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.290
 it will always seem to choose 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.660
 minimal tactics and not all skills 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.000
 will be equally effective as against 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.210
 monsters and against technology here, too 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 will have to think a bit about the type 2 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.160
 This is a typical bug fix for something 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.979
 that developers praised trite 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.440
 brought to the ideal for what they scolded 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.479
 or seriously modifying or altogether 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.760
 make from scratch now the game should 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.650
 attract not only a perverted fan from 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.930
 superpowers from opportunity 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.770
 arrange a massacre and mix with earth 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.690
 a couple of tanks 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.200
 she still will try to take good 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.850
 stories and conflicting characters 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.220
 what will come of this difficult to say 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.210
 definitely the second part will be better 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.830
 1 and this is good luck and see you on 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:20.600
