letting myself go you know physically

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.160 
letting myself go you know physically
emotionally<00:01:58.220> anything<00:01:58.939> just<00:01:59.210> because<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.869> was

so involved learning to this one woman

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.460 
so involved learning to this one woman
so<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.790> would<00:02:05.600> never<00:02:05.720> do<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:05.930> again

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
what I do and I think I lost that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660 
what I do and I think I lost that
control<00:02:11.540> when<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.140> was<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> kid<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.069> was<00:02:13.250> being

and you would coming together and all

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.120 
and you would coming together and all
the<00:04:26.150> new<00:04:26.419> super<00:04:26.690> reports<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.169> turned<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.860> all
