00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
off all right we'll see how that goes if

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
off all right we'll see how that goes if
he<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:18.210> extinguish<00:01:18.840> that

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
but I guess that's the kind of decisions

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.280 
but I guess that's the kind of decisions
you<00:04:47.730> see<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.180> from<00:04:48.420> time<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.750> time<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.990> see<00:04:49.200> his
