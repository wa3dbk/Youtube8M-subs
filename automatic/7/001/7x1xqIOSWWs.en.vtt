00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.980 

I've<00:00:47.760> always<00:00:47.910> thought<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.240> our<00:00:48.480> live<00:00:48.720> show

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
I've always thought that our live show

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.740 
I've always thought that our live show
was<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.220> big<00:00:51.060> selling<00:00:51.450> point<00:00:51.660> for

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
was was really a big selling point for

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470 
was was really a big selling point for
me<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:53.220> people<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:54.150> really<00:00:54.360> know

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
me I think people that don't really know

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
me I think people that don't really know
a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.200> think<00:00:55.380> if<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.830> ever

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a lot about me I think if we can ever

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.210 
a lot about me I think if we can ever
get<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.340> people<00:00:56.700> out<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.060> see<00:00:57.240> a<00:00:57.270> show<00:00:58.220> you
