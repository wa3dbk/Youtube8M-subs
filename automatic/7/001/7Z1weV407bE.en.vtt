know if this is the first scene footage

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.039 
know if this is the first scene footage
that<00:00:13.349> could<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.650> some<00:00:14.660> random<00:00:15.660> dude<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:16.020> there

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.200 
that could be some random dude out there
was<00:00:16.470> some<00:00:16.619> footage<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.430> believe<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
was some footage but I believe this is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.050 
was some footage but I believe this is
the<00:00:18.240> first<00:00:18.570> scene<00:00:18.779> footage<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:20.029> before<00:00:21.029> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the first scene footage now before I

the first scene footage now before I
continue<00:00:21.380> let<00:00:22.380> me<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.740> clarify<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
continue let me just clarify that this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.720 
continue let me just clarify that this
pair<00:00:24.180> right<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.449> specifically<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
pair right here specifically is a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
pair right here specifically is a
look-see<00:00:26.730> sample<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.349> colorway<00:00:28.830> you're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
look-see sample so the colorway you're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.620 
look-see sample so the colorway you're
looking<00:00:29.369> at<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.179> be

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
looking at right now will not be

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.530 
looking at right now will not be
releasing<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.859> whether<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.640> there's<00:00:33.420> an

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
releasing so whether or not there's an

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240 
releasing so whether or not there's an
alternate<00:00:34.050> version<00:00:34.079> that's<00:00:34.590> similar<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
alternate version that's similar to this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.850 
alternate version that's similar to this
that's<00:00:35.489> releasing<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.870> don't<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.170> but

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that's releasing I really don't know but

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
that's releasing I really don't know but
this<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.030> fact<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.600> release

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
this I know for a fact will not release

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.040 
this I know for a fact will not release
as<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.850> flash<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.510> camera<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
as you can see the flash on my camera is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
as you can see the flash on my camera is
on<00:00:43.250> hence<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> reason<00:00:44.640> why<00:00:44.969> there's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> 3m

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
on hence the reason why there's a 3m

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.139 
on hence the reason why there's a 3m
swish<00:00:46.140> lighting<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
swish lighting up like a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
swish lighting up like a
over<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:49.039> don't<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.129> why<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.430> said

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
over there I don't know why I just said

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
over there I don't know why I just said
that<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.539> anyway<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> side

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that but anyway if we go on the side

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.110 
that but anyway if we go on the side
will<00:00:54.090> also<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:55.039> there's<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.250> 3m<00:00:56.670> switch<00:00:56.940> over

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
will also see there's a 3m switch over

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
will also see there's a 3m switch over
here<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.739> AH<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.660> material<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
here and AH the material right here is a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
here and AH the material right here is a
little<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> scratching

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
little bit it's like a scratching

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.060 
little bit it's like a scratching
plastic<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.720> view<00:01:06.960> isn't<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.500> great<00:01:07.770> as

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
plastic the side view isn't as great as

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
plastic the side view isn't as great as
the<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> ask<00:01:09.510> me<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.560> front

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the front of you if you ask me the front

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.120 
the front of you if you ask me the front
view<00:01:11.130> looks<00:01:11.490> sharp<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.330> hell<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.869> person<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
view looks sharp as hell in person the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
view looks sharp as hell in person the
the<00:01:14.700> videos<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> pictures<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.049> don't

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the videos and the pictures they don't

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
the videos and the pictures they don't
justify<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> shoot<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.759> they're

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
justify the shoot because they're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.740

extremely good luck and in person now

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
extremely good luck and in person now
overall<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.530> shape<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> shoe<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> nice

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
overall the shape of the shoe is nice

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.770

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
and it's going to be off the chain like

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.759 
and it's going to be off the chain like
you<00:02:13.750> could<00:02:13.870> already<00:02:14.019> tell<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
you could already tell that this is

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
the way this is flynet material I didn't

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.009 
the way this is flynet material I didn't
talk<00:02:30.609> about<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.939> material<00:02:31.299> this<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.480> FlyNet

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
talk about the material this is FlyNet

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.130 
talk about the material this is FlyNet
material<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.269> material<00:02:34.659> within<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
within the design is almost like a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.449 
within the design is almost like a
canvas<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.680> not<00:02:41.859> really<00:02:42.129> it's<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
canvas but not really it's like a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
canvas but not really it's like a
plastic<00:02:42.730> version<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.389> canvas<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.989> don't<00:02:44.349> even

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
plastic version the canvas I don't even

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.690 
plastic version the canvas I don't even
know<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> explain<00:02:44.859> I've<00:02:45.250> never<00:02:45.430> seen<00:02:45.639> this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
know how to explain I've never seen this

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.339 
know how to explain I've never seen this
type<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> material<00:02:46.859> but<00:02:47.859> uh<00:02:48.540> yeah<00:02:49.540> let's

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
type of material but uh yeah let's

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.610 
type of material but uh yeah let's
proceed<00:02:50.669> let's<00:02:51.669> proceed<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.109> back<00:02:53.379> of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
proceed let's proceed with the back of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.429 
proceed let's proceed with the back of
the<00:02:53.739> shoe<00:02:54.030> at<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.329> of<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.629> shoe<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
the shoe at the back of the shoe the

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.920 
the shoe at the back of the shoe the
back<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.919> shoe<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.689> a<00:02:58.750> sample

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
back of the shoe this is a sample

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.800 
back of the shoe this is a sample
version<00:02:59.409> so<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.680> got<00:02:59.829> two<00:03:00.040> different<00:03:00.810> king's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
version so it's got two different king's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.629 
version so it's got two different king's
crown<00:03:02.109> on<00:03:02.290> one's<00:03:02.530> gold<00:03:02.829> ones<00:03:03.159> black<00:03:03.459> and

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
crown on one's gold ones black and

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.220 
crown on one's gold ones black and
orange<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.150> same<00:03:04.480> theme<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.019> shoe

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
orange like the same theme of the shoe

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.229 
orange like the same theme of the shoe
so<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:05.919> feel<00:03:06.159> a<00:03:06.189> little<00:03:06.430> special<00:03:06.609> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.150> I'm

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
so I feel a little special you know I'm

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.050 
so I feel a little special you know I'm
saying<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.489> looks<00:03:09.639> like<00:03:09.790> there's<00:03:10.000> a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
saying now it looks like there's a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
saying now it looks like there's a
Jordan<00:03:10.480> logo<00:03:10.689> on<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.139> thing<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.500> quite<00:03:11.799> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
Jordan logo on this thing I quite I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.610 
Jordan logo on this thing I quite I
can't<00:03:12.189> really<00:03:12.400> quite<00:03:12.849> figure<00:03:13.150> out<00:03:13.209> why<00:03:13.620> what's

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
can't really quite figure out why what's

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.629 
can't really quite figure out why what's
the<00:03:14.739> significance<00:03:14.919> of<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.459> shape<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.769> in

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
the significance of that shape and in

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.580 
the significance of that shape and in
general<00:03:18.940> there<00:03:19.449> seems<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> lot<00:03:20.079> of<00:03:20.139> funky

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
general there seems to be a lot of funky

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.649 
general there seems to be a lot of funky
shapes<00:03:20.799> throughout<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.190> shoes<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.699> perhaps

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
shapes throughout the shoes so perhaps

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.449 
shapes throughout the shoes so perhaps
maybe<00:03:23.139> there's<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> reasoning<00:03:23.949> behind<00:03:24.069> it

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
maybe there's a reasoning behind it

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.879 
maybe there's a reasoning behind it
perhaps<00:03:25.329> it's<00:03:25.629> just<00:03:25.840> random<00:03:26.709> who<00:03:27.370> knows<00:03:27.549> now<00:03:28.479> I

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
perhaps it's just random who knows now I

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.670 
perhaps it's just random who knows now I
have<00:03:29.889> no<00:03:30.190> idea<00:03:30.370> what<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.879> means<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.479> have<00:03:32.290> no

what<00:03:55.329> that<00:03:55.479> means<00:03:55.689> again<00:03:55.989> then<00:03:56.620> looking<00:03:56.889> at

what that means again then looking at
