00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.309
 crash it crash 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.059
 1 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.530
 pe everyone knows that our destiny is inscribed in our genes only 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.330
 the fate of 2 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.069
 but also the fate of all living species 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.680
 so it's very important to do 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.550
 to understand is that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.319
 is that there is in a gene and this few young 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.970
 so people finally feel the elements 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.420
 of the dna molecule that codes for all of our features 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 where are the young people so they are situate 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.740
 inside the cell 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.139
 in the kernel 

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.359
 and when we look at a microscope core we see the dna molecule 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.800
 in a form 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 of filaments that was leaning detrez 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 I can not know that the young people are there but we can not see them 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.630
 if we can or do not want to look better yes they are localized in 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.429
 reality 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.079
 we have the options is to look at the moment there 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.929
 the cell is divided because at that moment we see a lot more 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:10.740
 clearly that chromosomes 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 who are the supporters of there hate 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.440
 the der of the molecule dna and will try to forget this pond inside 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.820
 a small mention of proteins 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.070
 it protects 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 and he returns we have in the human species 23 pairs of chromosomes 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 they come 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.940
 for aqmi 23 of the father of a sea weights it's really all species 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.970
 sex but the number of chromosomes crossed from one species to another 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 if we want to look we will have clichÃ©s this dna molecule 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.270
 it is in this case that one of the chromosomes 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.340
 to the extreme we can see that sophie lamon is actually a filament that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.260
 is composed of a chain of small molecules that are the 16 types 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.560
 deoxyribonucleic for what is called dna 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.079
 and 7 16 7 chains bader al 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.389
 she is these dunes four letters tinkode 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.470
 who will be reading 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.300
 To make 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.210
 a protein 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.500
 there's like that in all of our 23 chromosomes if we roll out the whole 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.249
 dna molecule 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.809
 m about 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.319
 3 billions 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 these letters can be erased 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.529
 of life 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.719
 and on these three billion more than two of the being there is 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.509
 overwhelming who are against the instructions to make the 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.529
 proteins that are the genes 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.989
 there are the letters 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.850
 there is then the sentence 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.850
 knowing that between the letters the sentence there is reading 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.339
 demos and the words are read three letters by three letters 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.659
 each palette to say something 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.870
 to know everything about the protein elements that are linked 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.669
 even amino acids 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.339
 this young man 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.109
 to have a very close length 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.549
 variable a very large month of a lot smaller but they all 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.419
 three as one 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.429
 the fact that they produced game 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.889
 a coding sequence 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.199
 who says that the debuff of manufacturing that's called the 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.099
 sponsor 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.459
 and in the end they have a coding sequence that says it's the end 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.369
 and it's a shot in the water 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.759
 read three letters 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.459
 so in fact at the arjel 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.150
 it's a dl sequence 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.510
 between a promoter why start reading and miss so stop 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.169
 who is going to be at the origin of the manufacture of a protein 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.499
 and the proteins that are made from that are of two natures of 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.729
 protein 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.269
 two structures which are therefore the bricks 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.749
 living 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 who are the mad teaser who are going to be causing it 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.979
 of our cells our arcana and they are also enzymes 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.379
 who will graze the tools 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.559
 to make other parts of the human body that are not of 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.559
 protein nature for example lipid site and to shut up 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.379
 in the couple it's jeannesson how for all living species 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.540
 but all living species do not have exactly the same she the same 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.909
 shape of the garden 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.520
 but we can not say that all the young people 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.669
 finding all the species and therefore 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.639
 what geneticists often do 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.360
 when they want to understand what's going on 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.319
 operate young people is to compare 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.479
 young people between them and there is usually no common part 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.870
 all species when we see them compare 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.960
 and then the variable parts 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 which are more or less great for example rare 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.050
 the man who would have 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.189
 add a small element then that would be buckwheat 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.719
 and then that would be the mouse 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.509
 who will also have a little part of the tp clear ravard he always so 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.389
 it can be a long time to a tree 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.909
 any act 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.029
 he always has a common part and a variable part 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:52.130
 who does what 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.680
 for them it's gone there to witness the history of art evolution 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.840
 and the fact that each species has developed characteristics that do not 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.120
 it was his own and that will have seen an interest from the point of evolution 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880
 so we all have the same young people we have not exactly the same 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.730
 formula of the jal they include a landowner of the same species 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.729
 which makes us all different 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.950
 for young people to be at the origin of 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.139
 the visit of hu 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.420
 and our destiny 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.089
 elliott an infinity of possibilities 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.669
