00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.990
 good nelson were four years here in 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.470
 millionaires fc what balance does this 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.379
 season that he played on the good team 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.130
 first grateful with a team that 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.349
 millionaires 2011 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 I never forget that at that time 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.919
 we start in promotion with a score 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.529
 a little low despite all those things 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.320
 and I've already gotten there to start meeting 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.530
 an objective that was the goddess the board 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.129
 they have reality for me they are joy 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.320
 immense I'm going to take in the heart 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.640
 the titles that I have achieved with the team 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.149
 not historical things like the 609 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.879
 minutes without seeing the South American the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.360
 swollen that decorate in the name in the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.830
 single air path stadium and about 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.320
 all the birth of my son that 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.699
 joaquin of nation to be that person 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.990
 remembered forever and always tell him 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.570
 that from here was born a thousand thanks 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.520
 who or work is a millionaire like 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.880
 presented to the team when he signed his 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.299
 first contract that goal was drawn 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.970
 good 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.240
 richard paez 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.160
 the intention was to come and change that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.200
 thought of bliss that suddenly in 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.120
 years ago had not been achieved in a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.070
 ranking of achieving titles 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.780
 I thank you for giving me here because that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.010
 first year we achieved the title of how 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.560
 boston 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.730
 we got that South American Cup we started 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.850
 to the fan again believing in 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.740
 we always admired henych to the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.510
 good bad accompanied it but I think that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.240
 these four years we have built a 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.410
 team that is difficult to steal is a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.140
 equipment that is going to be kept in the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.600
 first places and that wherever you are in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.120
 the computer where you are and wish him 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.090
 best of the successes for this club 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.860
 continues to build much more than 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 all the positive things that he achieved in 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.690
 the team achievements titles if you have to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.100
 choose with a choose if staying with 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.100
 only one what would be 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.040
 I believe that the titles leave a mark and 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.430
 for me it would be with two in the sense 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.349
 of the 2011 title I played them that I had 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.150
 the opportunity to raise that cup of 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.579
 return millionaires to a tournament 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.230
 international and something very precious 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.090
 also that was my call for 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.769
 colombia selection of elders achieve 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 saying archer 'millionaire' I made it 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.610
 with the team that we made a great 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 campaign to be in the america cup 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.870
 Argentina then never change me 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.450
 that and that star 14 that says no 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.030
 it will be so many years for this club 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.359
 get back the natural star 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 surely nelson in those four years 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.129
 he had several anecdotes 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 positive as negative find 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.410
 soon to the fans some of them 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.920
 I believe that anecdotes 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.010
 things that we had to live at the beginning 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.560
 and not having a court does not have a place to 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.530
 train to move there next to the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.930
 court between all good challenges is hard 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.130
 of were challenges that a team like this 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.170
 I want to see and gotham 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.330
 in name that many people see it for 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.030
 out but never friend is a moment is 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.440
 our which we must go to the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.970
 people who lent us a court 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.450
 to train and so we all left 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.290
 forward today is an organized team if 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.110
 we look at it from a team with things 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.430
 positive I appreciate a lot and injury that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.269
 happened to me in a team like that 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.980
 organized because he did not leave me without fail 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.190
 no book everything you'll need to 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.080
 be well that is what you study now 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.870
 so I think it 's being in total 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.269
 be with her in the time of cows 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.100
