 show how we can make a necklace with 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 a material that is so fashionable 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.130
 how is the trapillo but before 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.230
 start with step by step I want to 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.419

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.859
 many beautiful ideas about paintings 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.480

 to subscribe or find the link that you 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.739
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.560
 now we continue with the materials for 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.800
 make our necklace 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.230
 cloth or fabric of a scissors shirt 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.410
 ball with the pretty big hole the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.050
 glue gun 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.380
 a lid of a shoebox and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380
 pin 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.859
 the first thing is to cut 6 strips of trapillo 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.260
 between 60 to 70 centimeters long 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.980
 you will also need a strip 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.440
 Approximately 80 centimeters 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.290
 we will join all the strips matching the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.180
 and we will put the longest strip 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.670
 making them stand out that strip more 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.680
 long is the then surround the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.800
 neck 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.590
 we will hold it well by going around with 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 a piece of thread we will make a couple of knots 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.360
 and cut the excess 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.829
 this we will attach it to the lid of the box 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.829
 of shoes with a clip 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.070
 and we make two partitions of three strips 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:52.940
 each one to form a stiga braid 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.290
 we passed a strip from back to front 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 on the other side we do the same we cross and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.320
 we keep repeating until we reach 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.320
 size that we like 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.909
 we remove the clamp and the box and close 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.909
 the braid with another piece of thread 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.410
 We will cut several strips of about 15 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.840
 centimeters 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.300
 we fold in half and go 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.080
 introducing the strip by the braid for 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.080
 form a fringe 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.019
 we will put the fringes next to 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.019
 others but always at the same distance 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.270
 We will cut the strips that were left over from 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.650
 the braid but being careful not to 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.650
 cut the longest strip 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.630
 and with some hot glue 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.490
 we are going to go around the ends of 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.490
 necklace with another strip of trapillo 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.349
 with a scissor that is well sharpened 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.480
 we are cutting the fringes 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.849
 me in my case the cuts all to the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 same height but if you like 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.200
 you can cut it into a peak 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.880
 to finish what we will do is pass 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.720
 the two strips that have remained for us 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.720
 ball hole 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.380
 if necessary, we help ourselves from the peak of 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.380
 scissors 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.590
 and our necklace is ready 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.110
 Here I show you another model that I made 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.200
 exactly the same but using the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.640
 strips that pull out of an old shirt 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.070
 this has been everything and I hope that I have 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.300
