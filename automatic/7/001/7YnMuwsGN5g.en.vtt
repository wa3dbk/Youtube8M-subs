careful with my lips with my children

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.389 
careful with my lips with my children
and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.000> there's<00:00:42.239> also<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.570> front<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and then there's also a front one the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.270 
and then there's also a front one the
airplane<00:00:44.760> pops<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.070> basically<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
airplane pops out and basically you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
airplane pops out and basically you
ready<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> go<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> note<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
ready to go one thing to note is the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
ready to go one thing to note is the
instruction<00:00:49.860> manual<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.430> under<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.420> foam

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
instruction manual is under the the foam

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
instruction manual is under the the foam
in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> box<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> bind<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.890> fly<00:00:55.920> night

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
in the box this is a bind and fly night

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.549 
in the box this is a bind and fly night
vapor<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.420> chose<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.410> dx7<00:00:59.039> radio

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
vapor and we chose to use a dx7 radio

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.599 
vapor and we chose to use a dx7 radio
basically<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> settings<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
basically all of the settings that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
basically all of the settings that
you'll<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.329> any<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> these<00:01:03.660> spectrum

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you'll need for any of these spectrum

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.090 
you'll need for any of these spectrum
radios<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> manual<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:07.100> couple

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
radios are in the manual a couple

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
radios are in the manual a couple
improvements<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> night<00:01:08.939> vapor<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
improvements to the night vapor are the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.230 
improvements to the night vapor are the
screws<00:01:09.990> holding<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.240> carbon

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
screws holding all of the carbon

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.200 
screws holding all of the carbon
fastening<00:01:12.659> together<00:01:12.900> instead<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> CA

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
fastening together instead of the CA

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
fastening together instead of the CA
mainly<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> Beck<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.650> then

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
mainly up here in Beck here and then

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
mainly up here in Beck here and then
also<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> rubber<00:01:17.549> grommet<00:01:17.939> holding

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
also there's a rubber grommet holding

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
also there's a rubber grommet holding
the<00:01:18.330> rudder<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.110> change<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the rudder on so you can change the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
the rudder on so you can change the
rudder<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.700> made<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> easier<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
rudder basically just made it easier to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
rudder basically just made it easier to
fix<00:01:22.250> also<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.640> thing<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> note<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
fix also just one thing to note the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
fix also just one thing to note the
battery<00:01:24.479> tray<00:01:24.659> does<00:01:24.900> slide<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
battery tray does slide so that way you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
battery tray does slide so that way you
can<00:01:26.729> change<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> CG<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:27.869> flying

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
can change the CG for different flying

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
can change the CG for different flying
characteristics<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:29.700> we're<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
characteristics and then we're going to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
characteristics and then we're going to
plug<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> battery<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> show<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> six

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
plug the battery in and show you to six

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.670 
plug the battery in and show you to six
lights<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:32.970> three<00:01:33.360> flash

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.289 

and<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.590> new<00:01:41.770> night<00:01:41.979> vapor<00:01:42.299> okay

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
and that's the new night vapor okay

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.420 
and that's the new night vapor okay
we're<00:01:43.810> here<00:01:43.930> I'm<00:01:44.140> plug-in<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.560> night<00:01:45.070> paper

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
we're here I'm plug-in that night paper

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.550 
we're here I'm plug-in that night paper
as<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:46.970> see<00:01:47.150> it's<00:01:47.300> got<00:01:47.420> six<00:01:47.690> lights<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
as you can see it's got six lights the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.550 
as you can see it's got six lights the
