00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 or save it all here the george is me 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.880
 we are in a new video a new place 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.460
 strange and weird and it's about the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 Sawmill is not the place where it is cut 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.150
 wood but not only that's going to try 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 the video because the sawmill seems to me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 a site that does not give to make a video 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 whole vale is a site that does not have 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 almost nothing and he was here with frames 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.099
 that we recorded this and another thing that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.260
 surely you will have seen on your channel 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.910
 also but well do not tell me that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.219
 copied from such because we usually 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 record this together and nobody gets drink 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000
 Nobody's copy is worth so good here 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.629
 As you can see, we are in sawmills. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.910
 taught before the location and the 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 problem that I had in making the video is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 it was day and day because it does not give that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 touch of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 siniestralidad if that word exists 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 to visit a site of this style 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.340
 but the truth is that the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 sawmill 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.170
 how are you listening as it is active 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 because you hear how you cut the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 wood and here so where is the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.290
 sawdust no yes I think it's called sawdust 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 which is what you loose when it costs 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 cut the wood and one thing that I did not 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.009
 account is that you can not see the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 saws cutting the wood because I do not know 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.500
 in case you could kill yourself or you can not 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 do something with the saw or I know if 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 happens for example if we put a car that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.119
 it would happen to put a car in a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.930
 saw for example is that it would be a thing 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.630
 quite interesting about having certain 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.970
 I do not know but good things of mine and good 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.780
 this does not have much nothing almost nothing of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.610
 Special special comes now after and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 as much as it has nothing special 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 Well the most interesting thing is that look at me 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.890
 I fell and well there's a blood stain and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.840
 we do not know whose spot this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 blood perhaps because of someone who has 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.520
 died here with the saw for a good 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.320
 so 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.340
 it was just to give you a little bit of 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.039
 grace but good there is not much in the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.350
 sawmill we know that the mode comes out 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.729
 history we know that we have to 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.409
 rescue here to the sea but good what 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.899
 I also count because it has not happened 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.600
 the game and they have given away the day of 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.670
 kings so I do not say anything more and good 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.049
 this has many roofs many landmarks 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.970
 where to get here for example there are 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.040
 a tunnel that you can pass here to the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.349
 wood but not right now they were not 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.110
 they were movements I do not know and as I say 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.840
 I think at night because the noise of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.519
 engines saws and others as 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.840
 it may be more sinister but it did not 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.940
 the coincidence that he was recording and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.519
 It was good day because nothing happens 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.840
 because it is recorded during the day it is a strange place 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.150
 because you do not tell this in 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 any side not in gta 5 there is no 2 of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.640
 this so it's weird that I have it clear 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.260
 so good another thing was this too 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.860
 tube that is giant that we can observe 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 all around the sawmill but 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.989
 I ask you to have better care 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
 be careful when going up because you are going to 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.159
 spend just like me here as you see 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.269
 the police follow me and there are frames died 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.069
 how are you looking down there at the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.500
 left because this is very dangerous 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.310
 know how you move a little bit more than 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.010
 the account you can leave you can leave 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.150
 very expensive and fly away like I do 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.020
 here and then obviously you died poor 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.390
 cited my uncle doll the one with sticks 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.030
 Well now we are going to the interesting thing about 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.580
 video my opinion is worth a theory 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.650
 over a tunnel under the Chilet mountain 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.990
 is worth the mount of this of the UFOs and 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 as we see here we see a tunnel where 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.560
 there are bars and we saw there good in the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.990
 same valuation location I teach and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.960
 as we see here there is a is here is 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.720
 slow of the tunnel and that tunnel is there 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.970
 a way as we see and it agrees 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.310
 perfectly on that road that there 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.470
 is going curves as you see here is worth but 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.960
 then later you will see that we are going with the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.300
 car and that road does not exist so 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.970
 we deduce that that path is below 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.950
 of the mountain and we also deduce that 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.020
 there may be a way that is accessible 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 a door accessible to that path and that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.020
 to see what's inside you do not know no 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 we knew very well 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.270
 how to do it so we put c4 to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.610
 that goes by itself 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.310
 to by some chance this this 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.200
 exploded and did not let go that we're going 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.470
 that we had 1 percent of 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.070
 possibilities but obviously no no no 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.890
 well no no no exploded nothing no no fell 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.049
 the lava was already a bent rod that 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.460
 possibly because he could not 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.370
 you could split something but not either 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.590
 this is inaccessible at least here and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.620
 like no frames because it kills me like no 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.720
 frames it kills me is that frame is we go the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 number one to kill the sweets or good 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.040
 here as you see what I said before 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.750
 we are going to move towards the road 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.800
 what I told you, this was one of the curves 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.630
 because as you are seeing we are 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.180
 happening right now by him over 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.730
 that way and does not exist or is it something very 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
 curious because that path gives us 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.740
 understand that it is below the mountain or 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.020
 either it is below the mountain and not 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
 there is no no way here has to 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.420
 have something down by force that is 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.510
 We were like about two hours trying 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.350
 to see an entry or something but there's no 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.570
 nothing 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.430
 then I will teach more more things but 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.960
 at the moment that path is very 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.300
 true that it is very curious and very 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.940
 very clear that that is there the truth so 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.310
 how good here as you see we got 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.599
 here I'm sorry if there was a trap 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.550
 in fact you have something down below 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.590
 but no no no with what is good now 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.840
 we go to the tunnels 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.080
 tunnels as this crosses the mountain 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.530
 obviously and we found a one 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.449
 door is worth calling this 01 I think that 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.030
 it's called these steps of fast cameras 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.229
 the road and good is called t 01 and this 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.819
 then it also gives that path to 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.400
 I mean inside the hill that 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.190
 assuming that the door then faces 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.229
 to inside the mountain as you said and 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.530
 as we see here danger danger caution 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.539
 all super super protected that can not 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.699
 enter nobody or is there something something will have 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.370
 to have there that does not allow us and as 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.020
 you see here if we shoot here it comes out 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.699
 like sparks or whatever is working 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.590
 and there is something that does not allow us to enter 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.650
 there is also another force called 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.750
 this 0-2 and well there are two doors 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.250
 accessible to the mountain and I thought very very 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.900
 interesting here I am with frames and with 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.790
 the head of 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.590
 of snowman and good to finish 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.509
 here I was with the helicopter 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.340
 meriweather stolen as we all do and 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.280
 I threw myself in a parachute but frames like 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.410
 it is such a good person frames s frames no 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.940
 they have a parachute and I the truth 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.570
 that many times for fall do not throw me 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.460
 and he told me to give it to him and so he does not know what 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.410
 that he said give him and for I do not know what and 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.910
 I 'm like an asshole that I'm giving 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.070
 the yy now you will see what happened then 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.600
 so good up here in the video 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.220
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.520
 mocked this theory that we have mounted 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.870
 framework and I and well that is to say the 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.449
 comments where do you want the 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.560
 next episode things like it is 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.150
 thank you all for your comments 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.479
