00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.480
 choose and then it was actually quite 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 Quickly found 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 yes it is always linked to rik van 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 more and more things are going from them 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 like standing like making a comic book and all 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 both need to make your first I 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.760
 really also better signs 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.190
 Rick I can for you or know things 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 but we cannot do that alone 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.699
 So we go in first seek advice from 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.160
 a number of people that are going to do that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 we also go out of the shot so that it appears 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 as if they are really watching them or you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.550
 mouth at come then come then come 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.549
 this is your mug you this kind of never 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.259
 gets further with 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:22.039
 when we show and utilize this 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.039
 light hair from the standard condition 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 i am i build drawing he is up in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.830
 remove all layers of a disc itself 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.880
 so you really have a sketch so you 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.619
 can agree 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 is at sign is when you then at the you at 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.319
 they have to draw 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.170
 they seemed difficult so often not 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.959
 but that is really a cartoon yes 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.819
 I tourism you cartoon yes more 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.860
 are you planning 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.840
 yes we have big plans for us 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.740
 go within two weeks and a whole 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 make a comic book 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.929
 so and then something once a month and year 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.789
 what are your tips and tricks like that 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.000
 soon as possible a good one 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.709
 drawing from the owners story idea 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.630
 have almost all the hall who I think 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.220
 always so that you have a story that you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.270
 These have transcripts 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.729
 Unsubscribed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.100
 yes then you finally go one 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.870
 kind of litter crap from what should 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.440
 in which picture so the same with 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.109
 to film 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.519
 until storyboard itself would turn out like that 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.290
 can see i have your text one 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.640
 Such are also online but here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.549
 So you see two people talking to 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 each other then the one says nothing then the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.030
 something else that you do not need 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 both have an image, you have a 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.320
 caricature of a famous person who 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 all viewers k yes and ted is then immediately 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.910
 to get started with our senate too 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280
 but so good to know it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.900
 is just really a per subject you 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 expected to have to figure out what in 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.510
 is because I really need a script 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.150
 to make 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.150
 that seems to me a thank you to your loved ones 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.620
 first to the hall we got again 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.950
 The overarching idea what we are 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 to make a piece of wood in which youtube 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.120
 trannies from light and our team 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.230
 team-dylan haegens as super clear 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.849
 youtube must have 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.680
 we have little time so we have to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.660
 arrange as quickly as possible if you won 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.670
 make the character designs 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.160
 of the superheroes 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.730
 after going from the superheroes i think good ones 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.730
 changed 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.530
 at 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.069
 No 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.269
 yes i am not so much to draw but 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.680
 it's just about the idea that you know 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.000
 where to put everything 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.900
 rick show you how someone 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.900
 cross-legged sign that is my skin 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.260
 No 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.670
 it is already a few days later and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.620
 we also go to the dommel trick for that 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.430
 advice we have had paul himself and me 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.430
 I'm curious what you think of it 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.569
 johan it made 300 done all this 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.569
 is imprinted 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.780
 after i get the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.640
 dance parade most needs this and the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.620
 rest of the pages it in us 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.370
 European is right behind it so it is 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.410
 hope for all your vacation on speed 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.430
 The correct thing about it is that it is super 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.820
 behind 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.430
 The first line is feeling good may 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.130
 bad i'm looking forward to that 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.350
 superpowers of play 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.090
 solve problem because that people 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.890
 have no idea question or because if under 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.960
 busy story has shown and story 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.730
 it 's not good to make a story 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.670
 which makes sense with a good ending 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.370
 is logical are the motives le 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.390
 the must have been angels conflict anyway 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.160
 soon write a book on one 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.140
 comic strip was it still looks so beautiful 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.700
 You know from a very pretty girl but 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.050
 say nothing to say that is not true either 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.410

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.410

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:44.570
 we do is that although my drawings 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.280
 birds the center of hot let 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.180
 but some press and we go 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.949
 to give away 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.770
 they are not going to delete in the stores 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.550
