00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:10.740
 good job done alex max malo 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's gone so clip presentation quickly 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.870
 done so here I handed the bubble 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.280
 actually sport for you can 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.060
 see so 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.060
 here are the tifs not in black super nice 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.450
 very pretty 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.370
 at the added passage of students of course 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.840
 the little gray we will not necessarily well 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.620
 I think we see them we do not see them 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.690
 very well finally 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.600
 but now they have the merit 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.630
 to be there then actually we can 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 to see blue but it's just an effect 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.180
 when when the vehicle is condition since 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.430
 in fact it is a beautiful light 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.150
 white that appears but flashing 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.150
 down to listen live to the missing 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
 missing 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.680
 it's nice to say anyway 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.250
 going here that's me excuse me scouting 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.600
 and it's pretty dirty but hey it's 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.850
 that we worked here so his special for 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 for bruno so you saw in black actually 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.090
 very nice here and then ben fires 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 back they got right too 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.610
 so actually it's very, very 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 black very black but so I put two 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.979
 layers of layers in the back and three 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.620
 layers on them on the clients to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.720
 the front but hey it's an effect 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.490
 optical also because we see well 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.830
 see red well do not worry 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.440
 I was standing up I have a few scouts on 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.510
 go a little more like that when 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 I have the brothel is a garage 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:56.299
 so there you can see my little 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:57.260
 tarpaulins have already been the light in that 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.780
 is a little red then 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.299
 actually I did not have the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.710
 interior trim in black so 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.930
 opaque we still see has actually 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.570
 so that's what's still giving 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.590
 more blacks finally but that's so 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:21.250
 tite and his sounds and lights his name 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.250
 but yes lights so hop 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:34.630
 then contact contact that gives us that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:46.030
 that's when she refuses to come that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 so sorry so actually and if I inserted 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.970
 my email help 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 we open we do not even see who have 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.160
 hidden it's done right after that it's very 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.030
 nice here and the watchmen kiss 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.230
 clear a maximum what is mind-blowing 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.709
 and in the back we always see 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.650
 that's me always that's it 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.420
 there is no problem good lighting 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's their problem 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.819
 a little warning to you 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.500
 to show the warning is the same 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.930
 always works very well we have not 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.819
 worry about it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:25.410
 so here's back for the front 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.410
 it's the same too, we see very well 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:40.970
 so our problems our problems I 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:43.310
 gives him a little kick start alas 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.579
 the white mega light what he illuminates 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.450
 thoroughly the crate the fairy very light 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.450
 very very very white 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.630
 here 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.120
 in fact I'm happy with myself 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.510
 you see very well so it's great 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.340
 good bah more appointments on x max 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.989
 extreme because me my opinion there 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.150
 aesthetically speaking I may have 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.240
 stop there there is a lot of changes 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.480
 anyway but by cons I do not speak 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.480
 rest 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.970
 this is one last have actually 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:38.840
 honvault I flatly advance them there 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:40.120

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.010

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.640

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.559

 the led is beautiful magnificent 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.669
 it is necessarily further 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.810

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.020
