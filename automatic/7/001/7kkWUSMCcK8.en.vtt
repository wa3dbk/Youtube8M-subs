 So, yes, the truth is that for 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.850
 see in the background here we have the figure of 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.280
 they are goku of the dragon profile nation by 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.510
 part of the prophet 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.710
 4 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.720
 I really told the reviews that he asked me 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:19.190
 Interested but only the figure said 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.140
 that what happens in this manga figure 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.560
 of video games in the stands have them 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.460
 for sale the same figure the pose 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 practically like the pose you see here 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.770
 later but this figure makes the difference 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.920
 what it has is that the metallic color and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.250
 it's crazy the box is beautiful 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.140
 I was because I was not directly 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.940
 museum collection and we will proceed 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.560
 only the figure to see it and 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.980
 then you are going to see a general plan of the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.380
 Fukishima figure here is 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.330
 I'm going to take out the figure I'm not more 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.330
 thought and more thoughtful that is already good 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.700
 totally empty and figure 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.560
 still one of the things that I did not know 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 that this also I think that happens to him is that 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.760
 the figures dismantled by the paintings 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.940
 opens up so I think it seems 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.770
 much more worth than beatriz 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.260
 totally quartered in half 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.490
 that we mount it, let's move on to another change of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.750
