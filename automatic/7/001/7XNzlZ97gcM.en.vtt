00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone and now i will show how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.180
 fix the game in the incentive that is you bought 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.170
 some load theme 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.370
 for example gta 4 but I already have a file for and 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.230
 evy and but tried to add me a mod 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 added then another added again she 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 does not start that is covered up can 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.560
 render some make a mistake and makes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.420
 that is, deleting the contents deletes it and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 Well, I think that as far as the face itself 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 download so it is deleted generally estima 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 and it does not have to buy it again from 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.309
 the library itself is retired and then need 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.079
 will re-activate to find 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 browser i.e. fooling like this 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.000
 make it easier to go into the game properties but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.969
 now I have been playing from here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 this here it is not aged go 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.280
 then go to the section 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 local files and here we have a lot 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 5 different folders that is, view 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.210
 the local file will open the folder where we have 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.430
 is the game itself create a backup 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.010
 a copy that is, if we are any 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 mods add yes yes for gta 4 it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 Most of all the games I have when 4 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.049
 prolonged which is subject to what she 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.830
 can be covered because of mods wot create 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.170
 backup and just here's a backup 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.659
 copies we will have whole all well and on 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 that we can say experiments that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.380
 want to remove us from the computer just 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 removed in the library she will stay 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 just we can say so right away 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.120
 go or download or just she 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.320
 will pause 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.990
 check the integrity of the cache here I click 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.800
 here we will edit the file check 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.890
 the game is pretty long 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.250
 even on powerful new computers in 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.530
 depending on the game depending on how much it weighs 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.400
 the game itself you have for example gta 4 with me 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.750
 about fifteen to twenty minutes checked and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.660
 now now checked where it came from 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.540
 that it crashes to me when the game loads 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.320
 I didnâ€™t check it out before 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.370
 then what files do you have 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.810
 which files are missing or which files 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.579
 wrong ie spoiled can 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.920
 so say the game 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.680
 more precisely steam ihsanova load and the game 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.079
