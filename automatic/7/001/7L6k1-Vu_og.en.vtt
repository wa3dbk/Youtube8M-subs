special section grab a number slider

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
special section grab a number slider
component<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.220> plug<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.510> radius

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
default value of 0 to 1 and so we're

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.540 
default value of 0 to 1 and so we're
limited<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.200> terms<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.130> size<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
left-click in the number slider we can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
left-click in the number slider we can
change<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> upper<00:00:58.350> limit<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> value<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.220> 10

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
change the upper limit to a value of 10

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.940 
change the upper limit to a value of 10
and<00:00:59.990> now<00:01:00.990> we<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> potential<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.740> make<00:01:01.830> a

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
and now we have the potential to make a

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.080 
and now we have the potential to make a
larger<00:01:02.460> circle<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.430> next<00:01:05.640> step<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> to
