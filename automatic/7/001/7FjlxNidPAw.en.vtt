00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello, I'm a movie nose and welcome 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.410
 to my channel and in this master 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 classroom you will see how to make beautiful and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 light earrings bells 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.330
 stay with me to work with us 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.760
 will need polymer clay 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 clerical knife or blade 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 a small lamp modeling 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 tool metal fittings 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 extruder and assembly tools 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.890
 also various beads and beads i take 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.399
 several colors of polymer clay roll 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.440
 long sausages and finely chop them 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.680
 I cut the sliced ​​parts together 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 and cut again grind polymer 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.289
 clay until it becomes shallow 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.910
 colorful crumbs like confetti 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.829
 do not mix the mixture 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 rammed into a single unit 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.520
 I form from it a cylinder that can 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.619
 will be put into an extruder 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.950
 putting a block in an extruder using 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 nozzle with small round holes and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.820
 squeezing polymer clay out of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 extruder I get long 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.689
 threads of different colors 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.119
 due to the fact that I painted plastic 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.170
 different colors I get beautiful 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.170
 and smooth transitions 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.420
 I take a light bulb and one of the threads of the tip 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.760
 thread twisted into a small spiral 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.250
 placing this little helix on 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.140
 light bulbs exactly in the center and keep 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.510
 twist the thread around her 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.400
 the threads must fit tightly together 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.870
 you can help yourself in your work 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.479
 wooden toothpicks or 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.760
 modeling tool when one 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.410
 the thread ends i attach the following and 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.410
 keep spinning 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.640
 but at the very end when the size of the product is already 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 suits just cut off the straight thread and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.630
 I get such a motley 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.520
 the bell is baking its temperature and 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.010
 baking duration look at 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
 the packaging of that polymer clay from which 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.990
 you sculpt and of course to make 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.990
 earrings need to make another one the same 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.600
 bell after baking proceed to 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.180
 assembly I take the pin with the ball at the end and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.490
 I string beads and beads on it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.130
 order in which i like the end 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.340
 pin round pliers I bend into a ring 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.989
 you can do the pins of different lengths 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 have some just prune 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.730
 pliers with pins of different lengths 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.430
 compositions will look more interesting 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.280
 filling for a bell is ready to take 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.739
 pin with ring on the end and separate 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.350
 ring on this ring join 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.340
 empty pin with ring and all three pins 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.340
 with beads 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.810
 I pass an empty pin through the hole in 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.850
 at the top of the bell 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.770
 cut off in such a way as to stay 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.069
 tail about one centimeter long 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.110
 and bend this tail with round pliers in 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.720
 ring beaded pins 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.480
 stay inside and behind the little ring on top 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.580
 I hang up the bell and u 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.940
 i make beautiful earrings 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.340
 bells thanks to me 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.800
 used thin threads and walls 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
 bells turned out very thin 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.840
 lightweight earrings almost weightless 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.590
 bead pins peeking out nicely and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.180
 shimmer in the sun is beautiful 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.300
