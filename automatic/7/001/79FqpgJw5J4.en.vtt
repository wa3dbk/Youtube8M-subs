hey everybody how's it going since we
pulled<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> engine<00:00:29.250> we've<00:00:29.610> been<00:00:29.789> working<00:00:30.180> on

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
pulled the engine we've been working on

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.770 
pulled the engine we've been working on
just<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.559> of<00:00:31.680> little<00:00:31.919> stuff<00:00:32.600> it's<00:00:33.600> been

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just a lot of little stuff it's been

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
just a lot of little stuff it's been
pretty<00:00:34.219> frustrating<00:00:35.219> trying<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.640> figure<00:00:35.910> out

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
pretty frustrating trying to figure out

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.250 
pretty frustrating trying to figure out
the<00:00:36.239> new<00:00:36.469> engine<00:00:37.469> beds<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.329> we've<00:00:39.480> think

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the new engine beds so but we've think

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
the new engine beds so but we've think
we've<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.100> solution<00:00:41.340> for

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we've come up with a good solution for

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
we've come up with a good solution for
it<00:00:43.280> we've<00:00:44.280> been<00:00:44.430> working<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> whole

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it we've been working on the whole

it we've been working on the whole
trying<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> sand<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> scrape<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> old<00:00:47.429> paint

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
trying to sand it scrape the old paint

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.799 
trying to sand it scrape the old paint
off<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.559> it's<00:00:49.559> been<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> real<00:00:50.159> pain<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.269> ass

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
off and it's been a real pain in the ass

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.799 
off and it's been a real pain in the ass
really<00:00:52.260> slow<00:00:52.530> process<00:00:52.699> we<00:00:53.699> got<00:00:54.269> some<00:00:54.510> quotes

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
really slow process we got some quotes

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.110 
really slow process we got some quotes
from<00:00:55.079> some<00:00:55.319> soda-blasting<00:00:55.769> companies<00:00:56.730> but

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
from some soda-blasting companies but

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110 
from some soda-blasting companies but
they<00:00:57.809> wanted<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.260> $1500<00:00:59.249> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> whole

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
they wanted like $1500 to do the whole

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.469 
they wanted like $1500 to do the whole

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
just a couple of full days of sanding

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
just a couple of full days of sanding
and<00:01:07.890> scraping<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.440> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560

weather<00:01:18.120> has<00:01:18.390> been<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.950> crappy<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> last

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
weather has been pretty crappy the last

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.510 
weather has been pretty crappy the last
few<00:01:20.910> weeks<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.650> only<00:01:22.800> get<00:01:22.980> like<00:01:23.040> one

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
few weeks so we really only get like one

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.290 
few weeks so we really only get like one

good day a week to come down here and
everything's<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> been<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
everything's kind of been at a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
everything's kind of been at a
standstill<00:01:29.190> while<00:01:29.490> we're<00:01:29.640> trying<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.120> get<00:01:30.300> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
standstill while we're trying to get the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
standstill while we're trying to get the
engine<00:01:30.750> bed<00:01:30.960> situation<00:01:31.770> figured<00:01:31.980> out<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:35.280> we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
engine bed situation figured out but we

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
engine bed situation figured out but we
have<00:01:35.700> ordered<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.360> new<00:01:36.600> parts<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.410> we

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
have ordered a lot of new parts like we

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.720 
have ordered a lot of new parts like we
got<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> new<00:01:39.240> propeller<00:01:39.630> made<00:01:40.050> so<00:01:40.980> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
got a we had a new propeller made so and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.610 
got a we had a new propeller made so and
then<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.870> got<00:01:43.080> new<00:01:43.740> engine<00:01:44.610> coupling<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
then we got new engine coupling for the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.910 
then we got new engine coupling for the
prop<00:01:46.620> shaft<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.340> flexible<00:01:48.120> coupling<00:01:48.570> so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
prop shaft and a flexible coupling so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
prop shaft and a flexible coupling so
we've<00:01:49.920> been<00:01:50.040> ordering<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> parts

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
we've been ordering a lot of the parts

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.360 
we've been ordering a lot of the parts
we<00:01:51.360> need<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.870> stuff<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.260> that<00:01:52.530> let's<00:01:53.220> go

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
we need and stuff like that let's go

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.770 
we need and stuff like that let's go
ahead<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.790> below<00:01:54.060> deck<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.480> we'll<00:01:54.570> check

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
ahead and go below deck and we'll check

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.350 
ahead and go below deck and we'll check
out<00:01:54.960> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.680> engine<00:01:56.340> room<00:01:56.520> situation

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.840 

okay<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.460> we<00:02:02.460> had<00:02:02.580> originally<00:02:02.880> planned<00:02:03.510> to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
okay so we had originally planned to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.990 
okay so we had originally planned to
just<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.300> blocks<00:02:07.519> and<00:02:08.519> they<00:02:08.729> were<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
just use these blocks and they were in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.339 
just use these blocks and they were in
the<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.239> position<00:02:09.690> everything<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.200> they

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the right position everything but they

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.170 
the right position everything but they
were<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.129> epoxy<00:02:11.790> down<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:14.180> we

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
were just a epoxy down like this but we

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.940 
were just a epoxy down like this but we
kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> decided<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.319> wasn't<00:02:16.739> going

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
kind of decided that that wasn't going

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.399 
kind of decided that that wasn't going
to<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.099> enough<00:02:17.190> strength<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.170> going

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
to be enough strength and it was going

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.080 
to be enough strength and it was going
to<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.590> really<00:02:19.890> hard<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.400> them<00:02:20.580> all<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to be really hard to get them all to the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.040 
to be really hard to get them all to the
right<00:02:22.220> exact<00:02:23.220> height<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.700> everything<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.870> we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
right exact height and everything so we

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.180 
right exact height and everything so we
decided<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.620> rip<00:02:25.860> these<00:02:26.010> off

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
decided just to rip these off

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.260 
decided just to rip these off
and<00:02:27.810> instead<00:02:28.810> we're<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.470> get<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
and instead we're just going to get the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.580 
and instead we're just going to get the
brackets<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:31.510> actually<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.050> engine

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
brackets that are actually on the engine

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.740 
brackets that are actually on the engine
the<00:02:32.800> steel<00:02:33.100> brackets<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:37.030> those<00:02:37.240> altered

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the steel brackets and get those altered

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.390 
the steel brackets and get those altered
so<00:02:37.930> they<00:02:38.050> could<00:02:38.230> fit<00:02:38.410> onto<00:02:38.620> these<00:02:38.830> existing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so they could fit onto these existing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.800 
so they could fit onto these existing
beams<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:41.850> once<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.390> have<00:02:43.660> an

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
beams and once we have that I have an

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.970 
beams and once we have that I have an
engine<00:02:44.170> jig<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.590> made<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.740> use<00:02:47.950> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
engine jig that I made and we can use it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.010 
engine jig that I made and we can use it
to<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.550> exact<00:02:48.940> angle<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.630> we'll<00:02:49.810> cut

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
to get the exact angle so we'll cut

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.010 
to get the exact angle so we'll cut
these<00:02:50.230> back<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> right<00:02:52.510> angle<00:02:52.720> then

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
these back down to the right angle then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.180 
these back down to the right angle then
we'll<00:02:53.140> probably<00:02:53.290> add<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.510> 1<00:02:55.510> by<00:02:55.690> 6

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
we'll probably add in like a 1 by 6

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.650 
we'll probably add in like a 1 by 6
board<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.490> cut<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.000> same<00:02:58.240> angle

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
board here cut to the same angle

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.080 
board here cut to the same angle
so<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.230> think<00:03:00.590> that'll<00:03:00.860> give<00:03:01.010> us<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.370> support

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
so I think that'll give us the support

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.860 
so I think that'll give us the support
we<00:03:02.510> need<00:03:03.790> well<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.850> guess<00:03:05.030> that's<00:03:05.270> pretty<00:03:05.750> much

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
we need well I guess that's pretty much

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.770 
we need well I guess that's pretty much
it<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.320> now

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
it for now

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.030 
it for now
be<00:03:08.780> sure<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.960> stay<00:03:09.230> tuned<00:03:09.470> we're<00:03:09.710> going<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.890> be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
be sure to stay tuned we're going to be

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.850 
be sure to stay tuned we're going to be
doing<00:03:10.220> some<00:03:10.610> more<00:03:11.510> interesting<00:03:12.050> videos<00:03:12.440> here

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
doing some more interesting videos here

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.839 
doing some more interesting videos here
shortly<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:14.560> thanks<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.680> watching

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.309 

so<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:19.329> soon<00:03:19.510> as<00:03:19.569> we<00:03:19.780> got<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.469> we<00:03:20.890> noticed

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
so as soon as we got here we noticed

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.119 
so as soon as we got here we noticed
some<00:03:24.540> hiding<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.719> our<00:03:25.900> tire<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> now<00:03:29.829> we<00:03:29.889> have

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
some hiding in our tire so now we have

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.030 
some hiding in our tire so now we have
to<00:03:30.280> change<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.760> tire
