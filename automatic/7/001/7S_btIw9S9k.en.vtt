00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.280 
passing for a through ball he would come
and<00:01:44.340> intercept<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.780> pass<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.020> back

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and intercept it and then pass it back

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.190 
and intercept it and then pass it back
out<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:46.680> does<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> extremely<00:01:47.490> well<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:49.020> yeah

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
out he does that extremely well but yeah

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
out he does that extremely well but yeah
he<00:01:49.320> can't<00:01:49.560> score<00:01:49.799> headed<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> save<00:01:50.430> his<00:01:50.549> life

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
he can't score headed to save his life

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.899 
he can't score headed to save his life
so<00:01:51.090> don't<00:01:51.329> expect<00:01:51.509> them<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.020> score<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> header

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
so don't expect them to score a header

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.190 
so don't expect them to score a header
although<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> defenders<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.689> usually<00:01:55.020> your

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
although the defenders are usually your

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
although the defenders are usually your
main<00:01:55.380> aerial<00:01:55.979> threats<00:01:56.340> from<00:01:56.520> corners<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
main aerial threats from corners and a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.569 
main aerial threats from corners and a
crossing<00:01:57.659> worked<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> dress<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.159> corners

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
crossing worked at a dress from corners

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.109 
crossing worked at a dress from corners
and<00:02:00.409> don't<00:02:01.409> expect<00:02:01.829> him<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.189> score<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.729> he

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and don't expect him to score because he

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.630 
and don't expect him to score because he
will<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.869> he's<00:02:04.439> amazing<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.219> defending

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
