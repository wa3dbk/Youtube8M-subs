00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.600
 Today I quickly as bios 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.670
 comes to his computer 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 you have to go for it right after the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.710
 turn on a particular button 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.039
 press which the esta stands sometimes 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 when starting down small with white 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 writing on the screen edge or is in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 the user manual or now finds 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.609
 it's out at google itself because it is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
 at every manufacturer or even at 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 every model is different with my computer 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 is a donkey is it that I am the same 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.280
 to press f2 after the states 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.110
 typical keys are also fcf 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 12 or remove the button i 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.370
 So turned the computer all the way 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 normal at the power switch and press 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 immediately afterwards my taste in 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 In this case as I said the f2 button so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 sees such a bio science that can too 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.739
 fix computers we are different 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.109
 appearance 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 You can not do that with the mouse 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.829
 you have to navigate with the keyboard 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.129
 or mainly with the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.869
 Arrow keys can go through the menu and can 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.580
 you can make settings here 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.150
 For example, change the boot order 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 so that the dvd or cd rom drive completely 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.070
 is above and then only the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 hard drive comes in this fashion style 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.500
 will ensure that you have the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 hard disk with the help of a windows cd 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.220
 or format dvd and new 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.049
 can install 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.290
 if you have set everything then what 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.750
 You want to go to exit and choose 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.770
 then a point at the most so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 similar as here exchanges is called 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.090
 Confirm by pressing enter and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 then you can enter here between years 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.720
 if some computers it is 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.180
 but also so that for only or y for 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.399
 yes must press on the keyboard 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.350
 there is again to note that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.079
 sometimes on the german keyboard 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.810
 the button must press there in the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.939
 American layout with the Y button 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.360
 We are reversed as a year 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.740
 Express enter and then the close 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.420
 saved in a bios and the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.880
 computer starts with the new one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.980
