 brother is such a floor. 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.889
 we carefully chose and and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 and we needed a light strong reliable 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:21.630
 tent because brother enters Crimea in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.070
 awnings bedroom for days and the tent itself 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:45.379
 tent double arc aluminum 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.379
 duralumin form windproof. 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 shorter than one person and and can collect 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 no principle quickly when will 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.010
 more experience such arcs are much better 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.010
 plastic made very high quality 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 see how many gadgets everyones and here 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 bedroom open but for two people 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.200
 enough with the fact that she lech 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.369
 curtain of light and then what's the catch even that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:42.509
 I like it when summer is possible without 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.509
 awning look on it the sky at sea 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:52.600
 well arc attached to each other 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:55.649
 here and also here quarrels show how 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.190
 the most fastened here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:06.460
 understood so they learned the seams taped 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.530
 and take me here seen here do not know on 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.790
 the camera will give or not, but here you can see left 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.790
 here it is taped 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.950
 terra incognita max light 2 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:28.020
 Ali maxlight is how it translates 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:33.930
 as easy as easy to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:38.310
 Lipah and yes velcro attached to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.910
 spirits from two places up is attached let's 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.770
 let's have a complete science 12 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:55.350
 velcro has been reading here already inspection 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:02.220
 You see these fast fasteners then 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.850
 pulling up buttoned mother then to us 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.890
 pegs 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's already on pegs 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.190
 so I think where to insert this 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:20.770
 Here here most likely yes yes it's just 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:30.150
 adjusts the length there that the school threshold what 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:33.390
 he clings here then this peg 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:41.250
 regulates no regular it pulls the course 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:45.239
 It turns out this is understood as a surround type 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 and then everything will be adjusted 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.690
 probably it should be solid 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.260
 design 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.260
 opening the wound 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.240

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.669

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.660
 extreme conditions other tents 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.090
 weigh much more per kilogram like 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.039
 at least him she is good on for 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.430
 your normally the only thing I thought 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.760

 but how to go to the toilet is permissible 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:45.240
 you want in principle a fine ring 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.750
 for a flashlight it is easy this is important 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.520

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.660
 . windproof is no longer tolerable 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.760
 experience it in the field 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.400
