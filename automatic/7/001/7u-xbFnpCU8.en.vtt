00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940 
we would place an incorrect answer their
correct<00:02:23.040> answer<00:02:23.550> needs<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.000> go<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.770> we

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
correct answer needs to go here so we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.920 
correct answer needs to go here so we
need<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.310> make<00:02:26.490> sure<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:27.150> our<00:02:27.390> correct

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
need to make sure that our correct

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
need to make sure that our correct
answer<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.560> there<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:29.700> two<00:02:29.940> more

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
answer is there and then two more

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.240 
answer is there and then two more
incorrect<00:02:30.720> answers<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.170> appear<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.830> C<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
incorrect answers will appear for C and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.699 
incorrect answers will appear for C and
D<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.320> want<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> make<00:02:34.680> sure

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
D as we do this we want to make sure

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.410 
D as we do this we want to make sure
that<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.130> pay<00:02:35.340> attention<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.940> those<00:02:36.060> because

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that we pay attention to those because

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.910 
that we pay attention to those because
those<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.810> how<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.990> buttons<00:02:37.470> are<00:02:37.620> keyed<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
those are how the buttons are keyed to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.520 
those are how the buttons are keyed to
work<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.270> slide<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.380> going

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
work so that in this slide be is going

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.740 
work so that in this slide be is going
to<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.770> correct<00:02:40.950> answer<00:02:41.400> CD<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.510> are

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
to be the correct answer CD and a are

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
to be the correct answer CD and a are
always<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> make<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.790> participant<00:02:44.790> go

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
always going to make the participant go

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.120 
always going to make the participant go
back<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.390> try<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.770> would<00:02:46.890> simply

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
back and try it again you would simply

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.340 
back and try it again you would simply
continue<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.970> process<00:02:48.270> until<00:02:48.600> you've<00:02:49.050> added
