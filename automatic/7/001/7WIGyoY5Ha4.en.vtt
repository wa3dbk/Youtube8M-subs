the equator and while I don't think

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.320 
the equator and while I don't think
we'll<00:04:28.009> have<00:04:28.039> much<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.490> an<00:04:28.580> opportunity<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.210> use

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.630 

here's<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.320> little<00:05:12.530> bit<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.710> blood<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:13.220> here's

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
got hit by a cactus thus proving that

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.200 
got hit by a cactus thus proving that
the<00:05:18.530> Equator<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:18.980> more<00:05:19.250> competent<00:05:19.760> off-road
