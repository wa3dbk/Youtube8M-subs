00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.400 
actually called light blue and 008 and I
thought<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:55.090> would<00:05:55.390> be<00:05:55.660> fun<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:55.900> switch<00:05:56.380> things

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
thought it would be fun to switch things

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.820 
thought it would be fun to switch things
up<00:05:56.830> from<00:05:57.100> nude<00:05:57.370> liner<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:58.210> a<00:05:58.720> light<00:05:59.080> blue<00:05:59.440> and

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
up from nude liner to a light blue and

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.920 
up from nude liner to a light blue and
I'm<00:06:00.340> actually<00:06:00.580> kind<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.030> looking<00:06:01.300> for<00:06:01.570> like<00:06:01.750> a

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
I'm actually kind of looking for like a

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.800 
I'm actually kind of looking for like a
lilac<00:06:02.530> or<00:06:02.800> something<00:06:03.220> like<00:06:03.340> that<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.940> think

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
lilac or something like that I think

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.390 
lilac or something like that I think
that<00:06:04.840> would<00:06:05.050> be<00:06:05.169> really<00:06:05.200> cool<00:06:05.470> in<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.220> water

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
that would be really cool in the water

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.040 
that would be really cool in the water
line<00:06:06.640> because<00:06:06.910> it's<00:06:07.090> something<00:06:07.270> subtle<00:06:07.780> and

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
line because it's something subtle and

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.570 
line because it's something subtle and
it's<00:06:08.440> kind<00:06:08.650> of<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.770> way<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:08.919> wear<00:06:09.190> color<00:06:09.460> I

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
it's kind of a way to wear color I

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.880 
it's kind of a way to wear color I
suppose<00:06:10.060> I'd<00:06:10.780> recommend<00:06:11.140> checking<00:06:11.470> out<00:06:11.710> the

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
suppose I'd recommend checking out the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.130 
suppose I'd recommend checking out the
nude<00:06:12.100> one<00:06:12.280> if<00:06:12.430> you<00:06:12.520> don't<00:06:12.730> have<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.510> nude

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
nude one if you don't have a nude

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.810 
nude one if you don't have a nude
eyeliner<00:06:14.970> because<00:06:15.970> it<00:06:17.130> performs<00:06:18.130> pretty<00:06:18.550> well

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
eyeliner because it performs pretty well

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.960 
eyeliner because it performs pretty well
and<00:06:19.140> it's<00:06:20.140> pretty<00:06:21.070> raved<00:06:21.400> about<00:06:21.610> in<00:06:21.880> the

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
and it's pretty raved about in the

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.850 
and it's pretty raved about in the
beauty<00:06:22.210> community<00:06:22.690> so<00:06:22.960> I'd<00:06:23.169> be<00:06:23.289> surprised<00:06:23.680> if
