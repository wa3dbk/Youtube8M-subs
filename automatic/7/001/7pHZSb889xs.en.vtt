motherboard right in front of us here

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.939 
motherboard right in front of us here
you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.030> see<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.330> process<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:16.020> clearly

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you can see the process there clearly

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
you can see the process there clearly

just<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> show<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> what's<00:00:21.480> inside

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just going to show you what's inside

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
just going to show you what's inside
this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.590> mostly<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
this is just mostly this just the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.420 
this is just mostly this just the
processor<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> standard<00:00:25.220> until<00:00:26.220> he'd

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430

sing<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:28.019> actually

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
sing with this I would actually

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.929 
sing with this I would actually
recommend<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.519> first-time

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
stability of also your build so on we

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
stability of also your build so on we
got<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> manual<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.010> thicker<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.550> put<00:00:44.700> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
got a manual but it's thicker to put on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.170 
got a manual but it's thicker to put on
your<00:00:44.910> front<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.719> case<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.180> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
your front of your case we want to and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
your front of your case we want to and
we<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.750> our<00:00:48.899> heat<00:00:49.110> sink<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.710> at

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we have our heat sink right here at

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
we have our heat sink right here at
Standard<00:00:50.219> Heating<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.730> Intel<00:00:51.140> with<00:00:52.140> the

Standard Heating from Intel with the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.779 
Standard Heating from Intel with the
thermal<00:00:52.530> paste<00:00:52.739> already<00:00:53.100> applied<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.579> pop<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
thermal paste already applied I pop this

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
thermal paste already applied I pop this
there<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.050> your

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
there we go so this is just your

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.880 
there we go so this is just your
standard<00:00:58.410> fan<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> 4-pin

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
standard fan right here but has a 4-pin

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
standard fan right here but has a 4-pin
cpu<00:01:01.890> fan<00:01:02.070> header<00:01:02.480> most<00:01:03.480> fans<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> market

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
cpu fan header most fans in the market

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.600 
cpu fan header most fans in the market
have<00:01:04.439> three<00:01:04.650> pins<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.220> newer<00:01:05.460> ones<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.729> four

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
have three pins but newer ones have four

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
have three pins but newer ones have four
so<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.000> again<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.260> believe<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so and again this is I believe this is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
so and again this is I believe this is
like<00:01:11.180> leave<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> Almeida<00:01:12.720> aluminum<00:01:13.350> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
like leave this is Almeida aluminum but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.249 
like leave this is Almeida aluminum but
a<00:01:13.890> copper<00:01:14.790> base<00:01:14.970> over<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.689> thermal

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a copper base over here with thermal

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
a copper base over here with thermal
paste<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.799> top<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.970> also<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.180> your

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
paste on top and you also have your

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.760 
paste on top and you also have your
screws<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> screw<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> into

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
screws that are here to screw it into

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.060 
screws that are here to screw it into
the<00:01:20.070> pins<00:01:20.810> another<00:01:21.810> motherboard<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the pins another motherboard just to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.630 
the pins another motherboard just to
secure<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.070> heatsink

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
secure it so that's it for the heatsink

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
secure it so that's it for the heatsink
and<00:01:27.829> processors<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> side<00:01:30.079> I'm<00:01:31.079> just

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and processors are on the side I'm just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.670 
and processors are on the side I'm just
guess<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> slide<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.729> Oh<00:01:36.680> open

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
guess we have to slide this out Oh open

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
guess we have to slide this out Oh open
it<00:01:38.030> here<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.350> processor<00:01:40.369> see<00:01:41.369> um<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> i5

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it here we go processor see um so the i5

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
it here we go processor see um so the i5
can<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
can really see it it's kind of like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.359 
can really see it it's kind of like
