00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.570 
them in the head but you have to get
these<00:01:25.540> positions<00:01:25.990> right<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:27.070> far<00:01:27.340> away

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
these positions right I have far away

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.490 
these positions right I have far away
and<00:01:27.729> all<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:29.740> further<00:01:30.250> back<00:01:34.500> nearly

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
and all that and go further back nearly

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.830 
and all that and go further back nearly
got<00:01:35.650> on<00:01:35.710> them

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.249 

so<00:01:41.549> further<00:01:42.549> back<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.240> can<00:01:46.390> seize<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:47.109> on

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
so further back as you can seize now on

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.050 
so further back as you can seize now on
top<00:01:47.439> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.649> plane<00:01:47.859> you<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.789> need<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.969> get

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
top of the plane you just need to get

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.399 
top of the plane you just need to get
the<00:01:49.149> position<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:49.630> rap<00:01:49.750> because<00:01:49.899> last<00:01:50.140> time<00:01:50.259> we

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
the position in rap because last time we

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.469 
the position in rap because last time we
I<00:01:50.950> don't<00:01:51.219> think<00:01:51.280> we<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.579> exactly<00:01:51.700> out<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.329> we

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
I don't think we got exactly out and we

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.399 
I don't think we got exactly out and we
was<00:01:52.689> stood<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.799> if<00:01:54.429> that's<00:01:54.700> right<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.149> then<00:01:56.109> I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
was stood on if that's right and then I

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.949 
was stood on if that's right and then I
figured<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.429> if<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.329> walked<00:01:58.600> all<00:01:58.869> the

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
figured that and if you walked all the

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.169 
figured that and if you walked all the
way<00:01:58.990> along<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.679> I<00:02:00.009> got<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.819> bit<00:02:01.000> there

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
way along that I got to that bit there

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.899 
way along that I got to that bit there
and<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.259> could<00:02:02.439> just<00:02:02.560> jump<00:02:02.709> on<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.009> top<00:02:03.189> but<00:02:03.789> now

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
and I could just jump on the top but now

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.690 
and I could just jump on the top but now
I<00:02:03.939> found<00:02:04.240> out<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.569> can<00:02:04.719> get<00:02:04.840> from<00:02:05.020> here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I found out that you can get from here

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.639 
I found out that you can get from here
just<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.909> there<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:08.049> thanks<00:02:08.319> watching<00:02:08.590> this
