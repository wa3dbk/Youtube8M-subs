00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.599

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.740
 philips 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 he rally micro with lightning connector 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:25.470
 they appeared not long ago 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.570
 my darling let's on the board oh yes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 all can read in detail in the reviews 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.219
 on the site let's say this we just decided 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.460
 introduce you to the audi system philips 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 doom let philip start for what 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.010
 left right and the system is actually small 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 who knows the movie is knocking and advertising 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 all sorts of tv but not so much 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 advertise accessories but meanwhile they 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 Look very good 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.260
 for example here a wooden insert even 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 here there is easy to install ipad easy 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 set observation 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 iphone plus it with an alarm clock yes it 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 great advantage 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.550
 and as far as I remember for these ones from 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.650
 philips of have a very good agent and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.830
 quality program to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.409
 do all sorts of things but how do you 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.150
 can see the device start right away 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.200
 charge when you install them 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 here that is, let's say this thing for 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 bedside table is very good she 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 wake you up and listen to music 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.229
 before bedtime sound quality is not very special 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.229
 good sure dolan to you 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:37.850
 on our own say phillips company which 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.950
 gas and made a bunch of it all so myself 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.619
 cool and but less 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:51.280
 the device is worth some how much she 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:54.500
 there is a series of 4 to 4 200 functional 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.410
 there are muslims disease turning to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.899
 this is just a music column 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.940
 at dinner do not understand music on this 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:19.760
 will come out on scooped up tasks 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:21.410
 Yes, and I'm on the icon in about the general 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.209
 audio systems let's say so 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.519
 entry level ie she can 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.120
 work and understand it from battery and 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.150
 suffers yes there is an entrance prize of half 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.410
 millimeter headphone jack 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.340
 control buttons here it is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.650
 Well, that is, in general, it works 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.320
 only the mains from the battery is not 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.269

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.430
 that price is quality and tony bowls which 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.079
 you will be amazed by the sound here only 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.560
 the main function here by the way is up to 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.600
 ipad here you will not put it all behind it 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.900
 Immediately wireless if delivered 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:08.890
 batteries 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 the fact you can say that the views of Jsc not 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.140
 connected this system says 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:33.519
 I honestly connect and right here 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:34.659
 here and try here went charging for 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.650
 own money 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.359
 removes nothing more option for the office 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:48.129
 or a small room 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:51.790
 this system is a big death here 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.290
 can ipod put mod appear 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.319

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.060
 and of all the gifts now we are just 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:10.660
 consider the system it is playing spots 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:13.139
 better than half the volume you insert 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.139
 so 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.329
 old man 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.770

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:31.460
 connect via bluetooth their big plus 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:33.650
 let out the case and how much it costs 90 but 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.870
 in general from the cheapest to the most 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.880
 dear too everything is relative 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.100

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.220
 The result for this money is good and 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.910
 via bluetooth you can connect and 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.470
 install anything but these and 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.810
 only for iphone and respectively for 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.419
 small room still liked this 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.210
 philips alarm system here too 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.850
 can easily install ipod 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.010
 but for the bedroom is a good topic that is 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.830
