00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.830 
and then stick it over your burger and
it<00:04:07.400> smooths<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.760> over<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.209> then<00:04:08.600> get<00:04:08.750> your

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it smooths it over and then get your

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.740 
it smooths it over and then get your
thin<00:04:09.110> plastic<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.910> start<00:04:10.910> going<00:04:11.090> over<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
thin plastic and start going over it

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.080 
thin plastic and start going over it
like<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.500> mean<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.610> want<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.820> do<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.940> good

like that I mean you want to do a good

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.090 
like that I mean you want to do a good
job<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.510> there's<00:04:14.660> no<00:04:14.780> bubbles<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.980> the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
job so there's no bubbles so that the

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.970 
job so there's no bubbles so that the
air<00:04:16.280> will<00:04:17.239> be<00:04:17.359> all<00:04:17.540> out<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.590> want<00:04:18.770> to<00:04:18.890> do

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
air will be all out of it you want to do

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.440 
air will be all out of it you want to do
a<00:04:19.010> good<00:04:19.190> job<00:04:19.250> when<00:04:19.640> putting<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.090> tape<00:04:20.299> on

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
a good job when putting the tape on

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.230 
a good job when putting the tape on
that's<00:04:21.109> why<00:04:21.290> I<00:04:21.320> glued<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.160> image<00:04:22.490> down<00:04:22.730> before

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
that's why I glued the image down before

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.970 
that's why I glued the image down before
I<00:04:23.450> put<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.780> tape<00:04:23.810> on<00:04:24.110> otherwise<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.800> tape

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
I put the tape on otherwise the tape

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.370 
I put the tape on otherwise the tape
would<00:04:25.190> lift<00:04:25.430> up<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.760> image<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:27.050> won't<00:04:27.230> go

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
would lift up the image and it won't go

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.080 
would lift up the image and it won't go
exactly<00:04:27.680> where<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.070> want<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.820> will<00:04:28.940> ruin

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
exactly where you want and it will ruin

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.720 
exactly where you want and it will ruin
everything<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.200> put<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.190> tape<00:04:31.460> glue

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
everything so just put the tape glue

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.370 
everything so just put the tape glue
there<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.270> make<00:04:32.419> everything<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.840> little<00:04:32.960> easy

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
there to make everything a little easy

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.940 
there to make everything a little easy
for<00:04:33.710> you

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
for you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.110 
for you
but<00:04:34.070> if<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.190> don't<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:34.460> glue<00:04:34.640> it's<00:04:34.820> okay<00:04:35.060> you

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
but if you don't have glue it's okay you

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.100 
but if you don't have glue it's okay you
don't<00:04:35.330> need<00:04:35.480> it<00:04:35.630> okay<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.630> I'm<00:04:38.750> just<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
don't need it okay so I'm just going to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.500 
don't need it okay so I'm just going to
get<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.770> peel<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.880> off<00:04:41.000> because<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.360> had

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
get that and peel it off because I had

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.519 
get that and peel it off because I had
excess

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.529 
excess

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:43.869 
excess
tape<00:04:42.769> on<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.159> edge<00:04:43.249> so<00:04:43.459> that's<00:04:43.639> why<00:04:43.759> it's

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
tape on the edge so that's why it's

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:51.669 
tape on the edge so that's why it's
ticking<00:04:44.259> so<00:04:45.259> just<00:04:45.439> cut<00:04:45.619> the<00:04:45.739> excess<00:04:46.039> off<00:04:50.679> okay

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:51.679 
ticking so just cut the excess off okay

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.139 
ticking so just cut the excess off okay
you<00:04:51.739> can<00:04:51.949> leave<00:04:52.099> it<00:04:52.189> like<00:04:52.279> a<00:04:52.309> square<00:04:52.669> sticker

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.149 
you can leave it like a square sticker

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:55.959 
you can leave it like a square sticker
but<00:04:53.689> I<00:04:53.749> prefer<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.349> leave<00:04:54.619> it<00:04:54.679> like<00:04:54.969> something

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
but I prefer to leave it like something

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.379 
but I prefer to leave it like something
like<00:04:56.209> this<00:04:56.499> what<00:04:57.499> a<00:04:57.529> white<00:04:57.769> edge<00:04:58.009> so<00:04:58.699> let's

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
like this what a white edge so let's

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.269 
like this what a white edge so let's
start<00:04:59.659> cutting<00:04:59.869> you're<00:05:00.709> just<00:05:00.859> going<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.009> cut

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
start cutting you're just going to cut

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.749 
start cutting you're just going to cut
around<00:05:01.429> the<00:05:02.419> burger<00:05:03.189> but<00:05:04.189> you<00:05:04.369> want<00:05:04.549> to<00:05:04.579> leave

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
around the burger but you want to leave

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.229 
around the burger but you want to leave
like<00:05:05.149> a<00:05:05.949> little<00:05:06.949> part<00:05:07.369> of<00:05:07.549> it<00:05:07.759> that's<00:05:08.029> not<00:05:08.629> um

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.239 
like a little part of it that's not um

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.569 
like a little part of it that's not um
the<00:05:11.239> burger<00:05:11.479> like<00:05:11.899> white<00:05:12.319> edge<00:05:12.559> to<00:05:13.159> it<00:05:13.279> and<00:05:13.459> the

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:13.579 
the burger like white edge to it and the

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.789 
the burger like white edge to it and the
reason<00:05:13.699> I<00:05:13.909> do<00:05:13.969> this<00:05:14.119> is<00:05:14.299> because<00:05:14.539> if<00:05:15.139> you<00:05:15.619> cut

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:15.799 
reason I do this is because if you cut

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:17.429 
reason I do this is because if you cut
right<00:05:15.829> along<00:05:16.099> to<00:05:16.429> the<00:05:16.519> edge<00:05:16.639> of<00:05:16.819> the<00:05:16.939> burger

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439 
right along to the edge of the burger

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.409 
right along to the edge of the burger
the<00:05:18.439> burger<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.549> tape<00:05:19.759> will<00:05:19.969> no<00:05:20.059> longer<00:05:20.269> be

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
the burger the tape will no longer be

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.839 
the burger the tape will no longer be
sticking<00:05:20.869> the<00:05:21.379> burger<00:05:21.709> to<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.129> back<00:05:22.339> of<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
sticking the burger to the back of the

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.879 
sticking the burger to the back of the
backing<00:05:23.179> paper<00:05:23.329> and<00:05:23.719> the<00:05:24.169> glue<00:05:24.319> will<00:05:24.529> one<00:05:24.709> day

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
backing paper and the glue will one day

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.399 
backing paper and the glue will one day
wear<00:05:25.129> off<00:05:25.339> and<00:05:25.549> then<00:05:25.819> I'll<00:05:25.939> just<00:05:26.179> fly<00:05:26.509> off<00:05:26.719> but

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
wear off and then I'll just fly off but

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.319 
wear off and then I'll just fly off but
if<00:05:27.499> you<00:05:27.619> leave<00:05:27.769> an<00:05:27.979> inch<00:05:28.279> or<00:05:28.579> not<00:05:29.059> a<00:05:29.089> nature

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:29.329 
if you leave an inch or not a nature

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.229 
if you leave an inch or not a nature
suicide<00:05:29.839> a<00:05:29.989> little<00:05:30.349> nudge<00:05:30.919> a<00:05:31.279> space<00:05:31.669> of

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:32.239 
suicide a little nudge a space of

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.539 
suicide a little nudge a space of
whiteness<00:05:32.689> around<00:05:32.989> then<00:05:33.769> the<00:05:34.099> tape<00:05:34.309> will<00:05:34.519> not

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:34.549 
whiteness around then the tape will not

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:37.839 
whiteness around then the tape will not
come<00:05:35.209> off<00:05:35.239> and<00:05:35.859> the<00:05:36.859> burger<00:05:37.189> wouldn't<00:05:37.489> fly<00:05:37.669> off

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
come off and the burger wouldn't fly off

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.879 
come off and the burger wouldn't fly off
you<00:05:38.089> know<00:05:38.209> I<00:05:38.239> mean<00:05:38.449> so<00:05:38.929> that's<00:05:39.169> basically<00:05:39.679> it

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
you know I mean so that's basically it

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.039 
you know I mean so that's basically it
and<00:05:40.069> then<00:05:40.669> you<00:05:40.759> have<00:05:40.849> yourself<00:05:40.999> a<00:05:41.269> sticker<00:05:41.539> now

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:42.049 
and then you have yourself a sticker now

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:43.749 
and then you have yourself a sticker now
this<00:05:42.259> works<00:05:42.469> really<00:05:42.709> well<00:05:42.979> because<00:05:43.459> the

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
this works really well because the

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.629 
this works really well because the
backing<00:05:44.089> paper<00:05:44.209> is<00:05:44.419> really<00:05:44.659> good<00:05:44.839> but<00:05:45.739> um<00:05:46.099> and

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
backing paper is really good but um and

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.659 
backing paper is really good but um and
you<00:05:47.149> see<00:05:47.360> how<00:05:47.629> I<00:05:47.959> got<00:05:48.649> it<00:05:48.799> so<00:05:49.189> there's<00:05:49.459> no

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
you see how I got it so there's no

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.789 
you see how I got it so there's no
bubbles<00:05:49.909> or<00:05:50.360> anything<00:05:50.599> you<00:05:51.199> know<00:05:51.289> into<00:05:51.649> the

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:51.799 
bubbles or anything you know into the

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:53.739 
bubbles or anything you know into the
