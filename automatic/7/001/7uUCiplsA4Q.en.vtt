00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.839 

interesting<00:03:27.360> very<00:03:27.510> sweet<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:29.489> basically

as like a actual ginger snap and there

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.240 
as like a actual ginger snap and there
seems<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.159> be<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> little<00:03:48.120> bit<00:03:48.329> underlying

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
seems to be a little bit underlying

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.449 
seems to be a little bit underlying
alcohol<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.459> there<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.920> slight

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
alcohol in there but it's just a slight

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.849 
alcohol in there but it's just a slight
slight<00:03:53.879> warmth<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:54.569> nothing<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:55.349> you

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
slight warmth it's nothing really you

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.250 
slight warmth it's nothing really you
can<00:03:56.010> detect<00:03:56.280> unless<00:03:56.549> you're<00:03:56.849> really<00:03:57.090> trying<00:03:57.480> I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.360 

can<00:04:04.260> definitely<00:04:04.409> see<00:04:04.739> how<00:04:04.859> that'd<00:04:05.099> be<00:04:05.220> awesome

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
can definitely see how that'd be awesome

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.890 
can definitely see how that'd be awesome
for<00:04:05.700> mixing<00:04:07.970> yeah<00:04:09.560> bit<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:12.120> ginger<00:04:12.689> taste

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
for mixing yeah bit to the ginger taste

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.559 
for mixing yeah bit to the ginger taste
would<00:04:13.139> be<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.349> bit<00:04:13.530> too<00:04:13.709> much<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:14.400> drink<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:15.389> lot

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
would be a bit too much to drink a lot

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.479 
would be a bit too much to drink a lot
of<00:04:15.689> this<00:04:15.870> straight<00:04:16.199> i<00:04:16.229> think<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.949> least<00:04:17.099> for<00:04:17.370> me

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
of this straight i think at least for me

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.860 
of this straight i think at least for me
personally<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:21.090> definitely<00:04:21.239> see<00:04:21.599> how<00:04:21.720> this

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
personally I can definitely see how this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.870 
personally I can definitely see how this
would<00:04:22.049> mix<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:22.530> well<00:04:22.650> probably<00:04:23.520> really
