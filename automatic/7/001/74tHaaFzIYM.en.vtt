career candleton yeah yeah how much when
yes<00:02:00.320> sir<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.870> can<00:02:03.050> take<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.350> little

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
yes sir it's so you can take a little

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.650 
yes sir it's so you can take a little
bit<00:02:03.680> those<00:02:04.040> things<00:02:04.310> mostly<00:02:04.850> costs<00:02:05.150> come<00:02:05.450> from

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
bit those things mostly costs come from

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.980 
bit those things mostly costs come from
the<00:02:05.900> hardware<00:02:06.229> right<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.580> sir<00:02:07.990> although

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
the hardware right and you sir although

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.749 
the hardware right and you sir although
it's<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.440> ordinary<00:02:09.710> are<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> machine

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
it's not the ordinary are you a machine

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.760 
it's not the ordinary are you a machine
but<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> cursor<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.540> similar<00:02:11.930> with<00:02:11.960> texthub

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
but the cursor is similar with texthub

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.850 
but the cursor is similar with texthub
so<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.970> imagine<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.660> around<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.800> a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
so you can imagine that is around of a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280 
so you can imagine that is around of a
thousand<00:02:16.220> depending<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.180> girls<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.720> that's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
thousand depending on girls like that's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.620 
thousand depending on girls like that's
a<00:02:18.410> thousand<00:02:18.800> US<00:02:19.070> dollars<00:02:19.459> for<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.300> basic

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
a thousand US dollars for the basic

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.720 
a thousand US dollars for the basic
specification<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.340> what's<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
specification I think so and what's the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.220 
specification I think so and what's the
most<00:02:22.880> powerful<00:02:23.150> components<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.870> put<00:02:24.110> in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
most powerful components you can put in

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
most powerful components you can put in
there<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.800> if<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.950> had<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> top-of-the-range

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
there so if you had a top-of-the-range

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
there so if you had a top-of-the-range
ideacentre<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:27.350> would<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.620> be<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.980> terms<00:02:28.220> of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
ideacentre what would it be in terms of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.840 
ideacentre what would it be in terms of
spec<00:02:28.750> got<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> tops<00:02:30.110> back<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:30.739> we<00:02:31.220> support

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
spec got the tops back here we support

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.380 
spec got the tops back here we support

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.190 
a thousand dollars I'm not exactly sure
that<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.209> will<00:03:37.330> succeed<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:38.050> it's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that this will succeed but it's
