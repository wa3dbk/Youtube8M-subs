00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.150 

so<00:00:05.290> the<00:00:05.440> first<00:00:05.590> thing<00:00:05.740> we're<00:00:05.830> going<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:06.040> do

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
so the first thing we're going to do

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.249 
so the first thing we're going to do
here<00:00:06.340> is<00:00:06.460> take<00:00:06.640> a<00:00:06.670> look<00:00:06.850> at<00:00:07.000> the<00:00:07.259> inputs

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:08.259 
here is take a look at the inputs

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.819 
here is take a look at the inputs
outputs<00:00:08.410> and<00:00:09.129> controls<00:00:09.849> on<00:00:10.150> the<00:00:10.480> unit<00:00:10.829> we're

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:11.829 
outputs and controls on the unit we're

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.259 
outputs and controls on the unit we're
looking<00:00:12.039> right<00:00:12.280> now<00:00:12.339> at<00:00:12.459> the<00:00:12.730> front<00:00:12.999> or<00:00:13.119> what

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
looking right now at the front or what

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.089 
looking right now at the front or what
you<00:00:13.360> could<00:00:13.480> call<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:13.809> front<00:00:14.049> and<00:00:14.259> what<00:00:14.980> the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
you could call the front and what the

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.599 
you could call the front and what the
front<00:00:15.309> is<00:00:15.459> about<00:00:15.730> is<00:00:15.940> the<00:00:16.090> input<00:00:16.570> side<00:00:16.810> so<00:00:17.679> what

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
front is about is the input side so what

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.970 
front is about is the input side so what
we've<00:00:18.730> got<00:00:18.760> for<00:00:19.119> inputs<00:00:19.539> we've<00:00:19.990> got<00:00:20.170> two<00:00:20.800> of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
we've got for inputs we've got two of

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.249 
we've got for inputs we've got two of
the<00:00:21.070> same<00:00:21.250> inputs<00:00:21.640> here<00:00:21.939> and<00:00:22.119> these<00:00:22.750> are<00:00:22.900> these

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
the same inputs here and these are these

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.990 
the same inputs here and these are these
are<00:00:23.289> called<00:00:23.500> combo<00:00:23.920> inputs<00:00:24.070> combo<00:00:24.699> because

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
are called combo inputs combo because

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.620 
are called combo inputs combo because
they<00:00:25.210> will<00:00:25.359> accept<00:00:25.779> an<00:00:25.990> XLR<00:00:26.710> cable<00:00:26.769> a<00:00:27.630> TSR

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
they will accept an XLR cable a TSR

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.760 
they will accept an XLR cable a TSR
cable<00:00:29.050> or<00:00:29.199> 80s<00:00:29.769> or<00:00:30.039> a<00:00:30.160> TS<00:00:30.580> cable<00:00:31.029> so<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:32.320> XLR

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
cable or 80s or a TS cable so the XLR

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.520 
cable or 80s or a TS cable so the XLR
cables<00:00:33.190> are<00:00:34.020> normally<00:00:35.020> what<00:00:35.140> are<00:00:35.230> used<00:00:35.379> for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
cables are normally what are used for

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.080 
cables are normally what are used for
microphones<00:00:36.070> almost<00:00:36.550> all<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.879> time<00:00:37.059> a

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
microphones almost all the time a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.580 
microphones almost all the time a
microphone<00:00:37.539> is<00:00:37.660> going<00:00:37.719> to<00:00:37.870> reviews<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.379> at

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
microphone is going to reviews and at

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.900 
microphone is going to reviews and at
least<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.890> decent<00:00:39.219> microphone<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.670> going<00:00:39.789> to<00:00:39.850> be

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
least a decent microphone is going to be

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.840 
least a decent microphone is going to be
used<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.090> an<00:00:40.210> XLR<00:00:40.539> and<00:00:40.949> so<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.309> can<00:00:42.489> go<00:00:42.610> ahead

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
used in an XLR and so you can go ahead

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.709 
used in an XLR and so you can go ahead
and<00:00:43.030> just<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:45.309> channel<00:00:45.760> if<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.329> need<00:00:46.570> if

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
and just right channel if you need if

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.970 
and just right channel if you need if
you're<00:00:46.840> going<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:47.020> hook<00:00:47.109> up<00:00:47.289> two<00:00:47.469> microphones

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
you're going to hook up two microphones

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.279 
you're going to hook up two microphones
or<00:00:48.190> two<00:00:48.370> XLR<00:00:48.730> sources<00:00:49.300> then<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.989> can<00:00:50.109> go<00:00:50.199> ahead

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
or two XLR sources then you can go ahead

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.670 
or two XLR sources then you can go ahead
and<00:00:50.410> go<00:00:50.620> into<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:51.730> left<00:00:51.910> channel<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.559> that's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
and go into the left channel so that's

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.160 
and go into the left channel so that's
one<00:00:53.920> thing<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.309> XLR<00:00:54.699> cables<00:00:55.239> so<00:00:55.840> we<00:00:55.989> can<00:00:56.109> go

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
one thing is the XLR cables so we can go

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.779 
one thing is the XLR cables so we can go
ahead<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.500> pull<00:00:57.430> those<00:00:57.609> out<00:00:59.429> the<00:01:00.429> next<00:01:00.670> type

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
ahead and pull those out the next type

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.070 
ahead and pull those out the next type
of<00:01:00.820> cable<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.559> TRS<00:01:03.280> cable<00:01:03.869> tip<00:01:04.869> ring

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
of cable is the TRS cable tip ring

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.190 
of cable is the TRS cable tip ring
sleeve<00:01:05.140> TRS<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.150> balanced<00:01:07.930> kick<00:01:08.110> this

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
sleeve TRS this is a balanced kick this

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.090 
sleeve TRS this is a balanced kick this
is<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.409> balanced<00:01:09.040> line<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.770> why<00:01:11.979> they

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
is a balanced line and this is why they

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.830 
is a balanced line and this is why they
call<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.430> combo<00:01:12.909> because<00:01:13.210> just<00:01:13.600> like<00:01:13.720> it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
call this combo because just like it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.929 
call this combo because just like it
takes<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.110> XLR<00:01:14.409> cable<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.430> can<00:01:15.460> also<00:01:15.729> go

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
takes the XLR cable you can also go

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.810 
takes the XLR cable you can also go
ahead<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.299> throw<00:01:16.509> in<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.950> tia<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.430> TSR

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
ahead and throw in the the tia the TSR

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.149 
ahead and throw in the the tia the TSR
cable<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.780> last<00:01:20.020> kind<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.470> almost<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.009> same

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
cable the last kind is almost the same

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.460 
cable the last kind is almost the same
as<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> TRS<00:01:22.150> but<00:01:22.390> it's<00:01:22.509> just<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.720> TS<00:01:23.020> instead<00:01:23.380> of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
as a TRS but it's just a TS instead of

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.410 
as a TRS but it's just a TS instead of
tip<00:01:23.650> ring<00:01:23.920> sleeve<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:24.460> just<00:01:24.610> tip<00:01:24.820> sleeve<00:01:25.150> and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
tip ring sleeve it's just tip sleeve and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.580 
tip ring sleeve it's just tip sleeve and
it's<00:01:26.170> not<00:01:26.350> balanced<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:29.380> other

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's not balanced it's but it's other

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's not balanced it's but it's other
than<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.070> same<00:01:30.340> it's<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.640> not

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
than that it's the same it's just not

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.620 
than that it's the same it's just not
balanced<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:33.340> can<00:01:33.520> go<00:01:33.700> either<00:01:34.329> way<00:01:34.479> you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
balanced so you can go either way you

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.370 
balanced so you can go either way you
can<00:01:34.810> go<00:01:34.869> any<00:01:35.020> combination<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:38.200> can

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
can go any combination like that you can

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
can go any combination like that you can
go<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.939> or<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.140> just<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.530> one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
go like that or you can just have one

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.310 
go like that or you can just have one
doesn't<00:01:43.360> matter<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.689> all<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.899> same<00:01:44.079> stuff

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
doesn't matter it's all the same stuff

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.690 
doesn't matter it's all the same stuff
so<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.460> that's<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.939> now<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:47.170> controls<00:01:47.700> we've

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
so so that's that now for controls we've

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.370 
so so that's that now for controls we've
got<00:01:48.850> an<00:01:49.000> independent<00:01:49.210> gain<00:01:49.719> control<00:01:50.140> knob

so that's the front the input side now
let's<00:03:03.280> go<00:03:03.340> ahead<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.610> take<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> look<00:03:03.820> at<00:03:03.940> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the same time this is a mix knob what it

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.190 
the same time this is a mix knob what it
does<00:04:42.670> now<00:04:43.540> remember<00:04:43.780> you've<00:04:43.870> got<00:04:43.900> two

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
does now remember you've got two

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.450 
does now remember you've got two

potential types of audio source material

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.150 
potential types of audio source material
you've<00:04:48.670> got<00:04:48.850> audio<00:04:49.120> coming<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.750> front

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
you've got audio coming in the front

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.650 
you've got audio coming in the front
what<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:51.250> saw<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.460> bit<00:04:51.670> ago<00:04:51.850> through<00:04:52.150> an<00:04:52.240> XLR

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
what we saw a bit ago through an XLR

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.920 
what we saw a bit ago through an XLR
cable<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.380> TRS<00:04:54.010> cable<00:04:54.250> or<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.730> TS<00:04:55.240> cable<00:04:55.690> and

cable or a TRS cable or a TS cable and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.870 
cable or a TRS cable or a TS cable and
then<00:04:56.620> you've<00:04:56.710> also<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.040> can<00:04:57.250> also<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.550> audio

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
then you've also you can also get audio

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.650 
then you've also you can also get audio
coming<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.810> USB<00:04:59.440> port<00:05:00.540> from<00:05:01.540> a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
computer and what this does is it blends

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.520 
computer and what this does is it blends
if<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:05.050> case<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.500> have<00:05:05.940> if<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:08.050> have<00:05:08.230> volume

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
if in case you have if you have volume

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.180 
if in case you have if you have volume
coming<00:05:09.040> in<00:05:09.510> for<00:05:10.510> from<00:05:11.080> one<00:05:11.350> or<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.560> other<00:05:11.740> it

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
coming in for from one or the other it

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.330 
coming in for from one or the other it
determines<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.660> level<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.230> that<00:05:14.590> volume<00:05:14.920> of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
determines the level of that volume of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.600 
determines the level of that volume of
the<00:05:15.850> level<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.210> that<00:05:16.330> signal<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:17.610> blends

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
the level of that signal it blends

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.150 
the level of that signal it blends
between<00:05:19.110> going<00:05:20.110> on<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.410> one<00:05:20.560> hand<00:05:20.800> if<00:05:21.010> it's

between going on the one hand if it's

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.360 
between going on the one hand if it's
all<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.610> way<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.810> right<00:05:23.050> then<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:23.950> only

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
all the way to the right then the only

then the only sound you're going to get

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.000 
then the only sound you're going to get
is<00:05:33.040> from<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.940> signal<00:05:34.330> coming<00:05:34.540> in<00:05:34.810> through<00:05:35.710> the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
all the way right is going to be a blend

of those two sources so normally if

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.930 
of those two sources so normally if
you're<00:05:46.900> only<00:05:47.230> if<00:05:47.710> you're<00:05:48.100> just<00:05:48.280> using<00:05:48.550> sound

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
you're only if you're just using sound

coming from the computer into the USB

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.740 
coming from the computer into the USB
port<00:05:50.890> then<00:05:51.730> it<00:05:51.820> just<00:05:51.940> makes<00:05:52.150> sense<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.540> crank

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
you're only using sound coming in

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.270 
you're only using sound coming in

RRTs
inputs<00:06:01.900> then<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.740> makes<00:06:02.920> sense<00:06:03.160> just<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.580> crank

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790
