00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
now if we will start slipping then it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.010 
now if we will start slipping then it
automatically<00:03:13.540> applies<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:15.300> ABS<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.750> that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
automatically applies the ABS to that

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
automatically applies the ABS to that
will<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:18.580> get<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> other<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.890> get

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
will to get the other will to get

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:43.260 
will to get the other will to get
traction<00:03:29.640> here<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:41.350> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.650> dirty<00:03:42.270> some

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
traction here it's kind of dirty some

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.050 
traction here it's kind of dirty some
bugs

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.480 

once<00:03:49.060> again<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.360> not<00:03:50.160> pushing<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.460> gas

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
once again I'm not pushing on the gas

itself so this is a really I mean we're

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.610 
itself so this is a really I mean we're
pretty<00:03:58.930> steep<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.720> show<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.960> this<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.320> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
pretty steep you show you this so and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.170 
pretty steep you show you this so and
then<00:04:02.740> I<00:04:02.770> can<00:04:02.980> apply<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.640> brake

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
then I can apply the brake

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.280 
then I can apply the brake
let's<00:04:04.810> see<00:04:04.930> now<00:04:05.080> we're<00:04:05.260> stopped<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:07.170> that's<00:04:08.170> a
