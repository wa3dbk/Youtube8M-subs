00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.720
 In any case, if climate change is already largely in 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.139
 Germany had emerged 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 in other places within a few years to one of the areas in breath when I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.150
 on 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.329
 GEA 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.329
 he 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.079
 and I'm really happy 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.149
 for that too we do not let ourselves be battled anymore like silence of the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:34.920
 lambs 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's all about this 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.620
 September 2006 berlin-spandau the Porsche Team Manthey selected plants 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700
 Washing machines are manufactured here 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.050
 As early as May 2005, the Group Executive Board announced that it would be ready by the end of 2006 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.880
 close the workforce does not want to put up with it and defends itself 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 looks at you with central in Munich 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.680
 August 2005 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.050
 the seemingly surprising turn of the closing decision becomes 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.750
 withdrawn 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.580
 By 2006, parts of the production will be relocated from Belgium to other locations 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 now the closure threatens again 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 the Berlin plant is part of an international company in Europe 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.800
 BFH is number one in the field of household appliances 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.480
 Worldwide, 43 factories belong to the company in Germany 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 seven locations about 14 thousand people 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.250
 September 6, 2006 berlin-spandau 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.509
 Space for 1050 employees in an old warehouse 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.810
 The workforce of Bosch Siemens HausgerÃ¤te comes to a 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.809
 extraordinary company meeting together 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.809
 It will be the longest company meeting in history so far 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:18.549
 of the Federal Republic and ends guests after 16 days on 22 September 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.089
 nothing works in washing machines. Production stops 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:28.439
 The workforce wants to consult because it is about their jobs for the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.439
 Do you want to fight dollars 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.129
 we will then start a surreal pictures around in this country 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.059
 Â«We will all write together with Lena cover letter 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.249
 companies threatened by the closure 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.549
 what you want 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.269
 Intendant Rolf Beck Industri works in Berlin 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.599
 and in the Federal Republic of Germany, however, whenever we often have 1 digit 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.839
 we are making the legal legal works meeting one 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.539
 Employee assembly are all employees of the 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.259
 Called operation 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.049
 the derby is not everything 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.349
 but something yourself 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.309
 Aral 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.309
 these 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.719
 went out 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.819
 is focused 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.419
 the dispute in this direction with all the possibilities of the host 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.379
 I can not imagine without too rarely 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.579
 and she will not come back if I do 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.729
 get a little bit sick or 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.979
 and how I do not feel well 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.249
 how can I get here anyway? 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.620
 it's funny this is here so i have times like colleagues like her 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.370
 I'm so happy to come here I'm just happy to come here 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.800
 I do not know how it is unimaginable to brake anymore 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.219
 They have their hair long for them seriously who the big winners 20 years 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.499
 the money first of all, that they are in other countries, the company 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.620
 It could not be possible to build up 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.439
 that the companies are abroad 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.699
 Plant build on that they write off with us 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.720
 that we basically finance the e-works that are mined abroad 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.870
 become 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.479
 under the deeds for the present days in the allowed time to the 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.960
 operating cost 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.400
 who more or less agreed that one 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 Third of the team in the factory has to go 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.150
 and that the remaining ones forego 20 to 25 percent on average 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.750
 for the tenant need 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.370
 Such a works council and such a workforce 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.370
 to say that she does not move hand 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.560
 I am shocked 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.689
 how firm 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.400
 Proposals for penalties 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 also ready for negotiations 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.469
 they mention in TromsÃ¸ 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.469
 they rejected a political rating with great system 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.900
 because otherwise everyone has times 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.539
 because otherwise it would disappear 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.439
 because they 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.710
 but then noticed 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.710
 this is not over for days 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.610
 4 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.099
 ManU I want the assembly to have clarity about the assembly 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.659
 To provide a situation 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.400
 I'm not here as a propagandist for TransFair 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.129
 Short-time work for transfer companies 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.669
 it is an end 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.860
 I already anticipated 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.610
 bad substitute 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.469
 for important work 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.620
 and then you have to be superior chairman if the alternative unemployment 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.789
 or if these are also bad substitute-ice if you look for this bad one 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.710
 Replacement decides 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.629
 so 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:39.489
 all top priority I think must be and he shows that here too 

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:42.479
 Activity that you realize that way 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.000
 that jobs will be obtained a transfer company percent 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:51.010
 Society here in this case would be the consequence 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.120
 if we have a defeat or a part of the situation in the fight for the 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.120
 To suffer jobs 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:01.409
 It is a 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.439
 twelve monitors Monatzeder parking under six old sensible 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.069
 On the other hand, it is very shameful 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.639
 when colleagues are inferior in three shifts 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.839
 with about 2000 euros the titles need 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.839
 so questions 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.110
 the higher wages 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.249
 the title 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:28.710
 Percent of work really worth it 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.040
 make no illusions a year unemployment benefit 1 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.339
 This was because I did not pass 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.069
 and yes the fold depth 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:37.509
 in fourth place 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:38.869
 is enormous 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:44.189
 then in the families too, the situations and what Roth is discussing 

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.499
 Allan and Pete Warden reported 

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.270
 whether with children 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.270
 from next week but arrested and later 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:58.360
 what our customers would need unemployed they were great around the clock 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.550
 assets
