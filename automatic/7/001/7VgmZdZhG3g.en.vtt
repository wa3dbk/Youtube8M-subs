00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
have to join a game just for a video and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.229 
have to join a game just for a video and
then<00:00:30.420> leave<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.520> whatnot<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.910> doing<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
then leave and whatnot so I'm doing it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
then leave and whatnot so I'm doing it
this<00:00:33.390> way<00:00:33.450> instead<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.250> guys<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
this way instead you guys are going to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
this way instead you guys are going to
see<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.030> differences<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
see some differences here I have a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
see some differences here I have a
different<00:00:38.219> tile<00:00:38.370> set<00:00:38.700> loaded<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.210> probably

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
different tile set loaded I probably

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
different tile set loaded I probably
should<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.899> set<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> back<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> little

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
should have set that back to a little

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
should have set that back to a little
but<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> didn't<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.020> hack<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
but I didn't it's not really a hack it's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
but I didn't it's not really a hack it's
kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.100> program<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.700> changes<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
kind of just a program that changes the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.889 
kind of just a program that changes the
background<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.399> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.670> nice<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.750> get

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
background it's a kind of a nice to get

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.950 
background it's a kind of a nice to get
away<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.530> usual<00:00:53.039> DOTA<00:00:53.550> map<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
away from the usual DOTA map a little a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.670 
away from the usual DOTA map a little a
little<00:00:55.860> easier<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> eyes<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.680> right

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
little easier on the eyes maybe right

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.900 
little easier on the eyes maybe right
now<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.039> waiting<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.460> groups<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
now we're just waiting for groups to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
now we're just waiting for groups to
spawn<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> babble<00:01:01.410> about

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
spawn so I'm just kind of babble about

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.119 
spawn so I'm just kind of babble about

to me and now I'm out of harassing range

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.970 
to me and now I'm out of harassing range
if<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.510> was<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.660> meadow<00:03:55.959> if<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> male<00:03:56.920> I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
if it was a meadow if it was a male I

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.880 
if it was a meadow if it was a male I
hear<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.430> would<00:03:57.550> be<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.670> different<00:03:57.910> story<00:03:58.890> it's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
hear it would be a different story it's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.080 
hear it would be a different story it's
basically<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.340> same<00:04:00.640> thing<00:04:00.700> though<00:04:01.030> you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
basically the same thing though you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.820 
basically the same thing though you
might<00:04:01.330> still<00:04:01.630> be<00:04:01.810> in<00:04:01.840> harassing<00:04:02.230> ranch<00:04:02.650> you

might still be in harassing ranch you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.809 
might still be in harassing ranch you
might<00:04:03.010> not<00:04:03.160> be<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:08.800> that's<00:04:09.160> basically<00:04:09.370> it

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
might not be but that's basically it

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.090 
might not be but that's basically it
it's<00:04:10.209> rather<00:04:10.480> simple<00:04:10.900> except<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.890> tower
