00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
also have some linen thread that we'll

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.240 
also have some linen thread that we'll
be<00:00:40.330> using<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:43.930> take<00:00:44.050> our<00:00:44.560> seam<00:00:44.980> binding

be using so if we take our seam binding
ribbon<00:00:45.880> and<00:00:46.270> we're<00:00:47.260> going<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.590> make<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.730> base

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
ribbon and we're going to make the base

ribbon and we're going to make the base
of<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.270> bow<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.290> I<00:00:50.350> just<00:00:50.620> start<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.130> tail

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
of the bow so I just start with the tail

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.350 
of the bow so I just start with the tail
just<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.570> pinch<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.350> ribbon<00:00:53.770> then<00:00:54.489> I<00:00:54.670> wrap<00:00:55.000> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
just and pinch the ribbon then I wrap a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.729 
just and pinch the ribbon then I wrap a
loop<00:00:57.210> about<00:00:58.210> well<00:00:58.870> that's<00:00:59.050> probably<00:00:59.290> about<00:00:59.469> an

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
loop about well that's probably about an

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.280 
loop about well that's probably about an
inch<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.460> half<00:01:00.520> two<00:01:00.879> inches<00:01:00.910> on<00:01:01.540> each<00:01:02.260> side

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
inch and a half two inches on each side

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.340 
inch and a half two inches on each side
then<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.399> wrap<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.000> next<00:01:04.629> one<00:01:04.750> just<00:01:04.899> pinching

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
then I wrap the next one just pinching

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.779 
then I wrap the next one just pinching
it<00:01:05.470> between<00:01:05.830> my<00:01:06.040> two<00:01:06.100> fingers<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.509> loop<00:01:07.899> and

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
it between my two fingers so loop and

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.719 
it between my two fingers so loop and
pinch<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.710> loop<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:13.260> pinch<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.710> then<00:01:15.549> I'm

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
pinch then loop and pinch and then I'm

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.490 
pinch then loop and pinch and then I'm
going<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.060> do<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:17.220> until<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.310> have<00:01:18.610> about

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
going to do this until I have about

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.469

three on each side I'm going to cut off

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.130 
three on each side I'm going to cut off
this<00:01:25.900> tail<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:28.119> I'll<00:01:28.299> take<00:01:28.810> another

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
this tail and then I'll take another

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.060 
this tail and then I'll take another
piece<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.830> seam<00:01:30.130> binding<00:01:30.340> ribbon<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640 
then I will tie it around the center of
those<00:01:38.530> loops<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.509> complete<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:41.170> base<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.560> the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
those loops to complete the base of the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.499 
those loops to complete the base of the
low<00:01:45.000> alright<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:47.670> we'll<00:01:48.670> keep<00:01:48.909> these<00:01:49.150> tails

threading<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.640> at<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.300> bottom<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.780> those

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
threading this at the bottom so those

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.770 
threading this at the bottom so those
really<00:02:47.890> little<00:02:48.250> loops<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.880> are<00:02:48.940> right<00:02:49.270> down

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
really little loops that are right down

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.530 
really little loops that are right down
here<00:02:50.170> at<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.100> base<00:02:51.490> here<00:02:51.820> that's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
here at the at the base here that's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
here at the at the base here that's
where<00:02:52.750> we're<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.620> out<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.220> I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
where we're going to go in and out and I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
where we're going to go in and out and I
like<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.760> go<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.300> out<00:02:55.390> every<00:02:55.630> two<00:02:56.020> or<00:02:56.230> three

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
like I go in and out every two or three

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310 
like I go in and out every two or three
of<00:02:56.590> them<00:02:56.740> just<00:02:57.070> back<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.670> forth<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:59.290> and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
of them just back and forth back and

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
of them just back and forth back and
forth<00:02:59.640> then<00:03:00.930> pull<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> thread<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:03.130> don't

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
forth then pull the thread but don't

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520 
forth then pull the thread but don't
pull<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.820> all<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:03.970> way<00:03:04.090> through<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.380> you're

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
pull it all the way through so you're

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.820 
pull it all the way through so you're
just<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.980> keep<00:03:06.130> going<00:03:06.310> back<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:07.030> forth

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
just going to keep going back and forth

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.590 
just going to keep going back and forth
back<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.130> forth<00:03:10.440> alright<00:03:11.440> can<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.740> see<00:03:12.010> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
back and forth alright can you see that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.960 
back and forth alright can you see that
maybe<00:03:13.600> not<00:03:13.840> very<00:03:14.170> well<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.860> camera<00:03:15.250> so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
maybe not very well on the camera so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.640 
maybe not very well on the camera so
just<00:03:16.890> every<00:03:17.890> three<00:03:18.160> or<00:03:18.190> four<00:03:19.290> until<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.470> do

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
just every three or four until you do

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.710 
just every three or four until you do
the<00:03:20.890> entire<00:03:21.820> length<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.830> ribbon<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
the entire length of the ribbon so I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.290 
the entire length of the ribbon so I
have<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:26.800> already<00:03:27.070> done<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:28.000> entire

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
have this one already done the entire

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.340 
have this one already done the entire
length<00:03:29.580> then<00:03:30.580> we'll<00:03:30.700> gather<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.300> up<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:31.989> just

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
length then we'll gather this up so just

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.390 
length then we'll gather this up so just
gather<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.860> from<00:03:33.580> both<00:03:33.730> ends<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:35.650> get

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
gather it from both ends and you get

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.360 
gather it from both ends and you get
this<00:03:36.550> piece<00:03:36.850> here<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:38.080> then<00:03:39.070> we're<00:03:39.220> going<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
this piece here so then we're going to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
this piece here so then we're going to
take<00:03:39.459> our<00:03:40.019> gathered<00:03:41.019> piece<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.850> kind<00:03:43.090> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
take our gathered piece and just kind of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.009 
take our gathered piece and just kind of
wrap<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.650> around<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.989> form<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:49.019> little

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
wrap it around so it can form a little

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:58.410 
wrap it around so it can form a little
spiral<00:03:50.890> flower<00:03:54.720> okay<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:58.030> then<00:03:58.300> on
