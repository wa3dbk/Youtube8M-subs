00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.559
 Let's take a look at the 22nd number in 2007 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.500
 It is the first choice , but it is a second-class low-rise residential area 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.750
 Hairdresser with a meter of 100 yen for the day 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:26.590
 Is it possible to detect it? Well I think no one remembers this 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.830
 But maybe this is an architecture that I could build and maybe I got a quick Kokura yet easy arrival 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.960
 I want you 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:38.330
 There are things I often use as plums when I walk in a residential area 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 In a house that about two-storey detached houses lined 1 Kaigao shop 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:47.820
 Soba shops, cafes, hospitals, cleaners and so on are sold three times maybe 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.930
 Shops in the direction of family Nee called the I wonder I wonder live 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.700
 building 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.330
 A shop that you have actually seen walking in a residential area 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.880
 I think that it may be good if you judge that this can be built 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 Are for the most Well maybe you all's this sometimes in the pattern I use the region down 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.950
 Very year to get the image bloated 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.520
 There is a wonderful case that I want to advance 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.700
 What say if the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport website is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.770
 It is the homepage of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Search by yahoo or google etc. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.590
 Kedomo you can find if you can 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:28.940
 For the story of the town development to promote urban development story in this everyone to proceed with everyone in it 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:32.660
 Illustrations are shown for 12 different application areas and typical 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:38.570
 It is this that building use is listed, too 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:44.240
 It looks like a residential area like this while looking for 11 years, but a low-rise residential area is a commercial area like this 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.930
 Then if you have an image in such a thing, you have never seen it in a real incident 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.470
 I have seen something when I was walking on this city when I was using a building for a purpose 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 So maybe I think it will be easier to judge Basaro maybe still low by all means Tax firmly decided 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.540
 Place 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.840
 I hope you can put it in your head 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 Yes, let's take a look at the No. 2 choice in it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.479
 It is the second choice but 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.200
 So much the adult Re localities in the low-rise exclusive residential area 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.750
 Since the origin chanting and become too close is seen This is a little bad 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 There is a rule that from your neighbor's who of the boundary line will help you a little to retract the outer wall of the building 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.090
 The rule of retreat distance of this outer wall is 1.5m 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 Or it will be chosen by city planning from either 1.0m 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 Then in the selection's 1 This path 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.980
 If there is no good point with 3 points and you need to wash it out in 3 meters, the second is the bus and the choice is followed by 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.599
 Mr 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.590
 Sanno of choice, but there is a maximum limit rule of height in the low-rise residential area 10m 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.230
 Or 12m 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.890
 You can choose either gar Urban Planning 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:59.319
 Maximum limit Noru of this low-rise exclusive residential area only of height 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:05.050
 10m or you're good standing building at less than 12m So in 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:07.450
 For example, in the case of either 9.5m, a building with a height of 9.5m ok 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.250
 That's the third choice is buzz 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.880
 Ok if you want to keep more than 10 meters even if it exceeds 9 meters 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.950
 If you say house 10m ok 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.910
 I'll wait nine times, so I'll wait for the summer 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.970
 Last 4 to 40,000 new, but let's answer with confidence here 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.900
 Border line 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:32.700
 Color 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:34.530
 Take dee and height for the residential area during the rise of a 20 meter building and 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.540
 The other umbrella 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.870
 Occupied from the part to the beat diagonally Do not mess with well parts or buildings 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.920
 The next line is the slash limit 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.290
 In this Rin- chan teacher limitation next door 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:55.870
 By I say will enter the use light so that there is as much as possible playing talking Shiokin investment in the production area 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:00.160
 More than this 20 meter high part for 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.750
 Umero attached to the part has become a rule that tall building metabolism useless 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.230
 That means 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:12.530
 In the low floor residential area only 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.610
 10m or 12m tall building from here no good place no good building with no good 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.250
 Because there is a rule to say 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:26.250
 You will be this neighboring land shaded restriction is known exists if there which was provided 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.630
 To begin with Lee char before because there is no low-rise exclusive residential area I've had # 10 of this highly tall building 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.110
 Justice has no meaning 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.630
 Himself and 10 sheets are provided under the wheel cars teacher because that will be that there is no second kind case dwelling player 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.409
 From the arm 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.289
 Let's try 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:47.389
 About the second issue of the 2nd manufacturing housing area about this text Spotter about this disputed housing area
