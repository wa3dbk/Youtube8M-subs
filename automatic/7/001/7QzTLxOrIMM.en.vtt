t1 for teleport or tele pad 1 and then

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.969 
t1 for teleport or tele pad 1 and then
it's<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> give<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> coordinates

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.640 
right here and we're gonna name this one
t2<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.670> tele<00:02:14.970> pad<00:02:15.240> 2<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
t2 for tele pad 2 so there we go it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.310 
t2 for tele pad 2 so there we go it's
gonna<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.480> coordinates<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:19.170> the

gonna give you the coordinates for the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.970 
gonna give you the coordinates for the
second

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
second

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.250 
second
helipad<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.750> jump<00:02:22.050> down

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
helipad and what we can do is jump down

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.100 
helipad and what we can do is jump down
here<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.400> felt<00:02:24.299> we<00:02:24.659> just<00:02:24.840> got<00:02:24.959> some

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110

here and we just felt we just got some
damage<00:02:25.349> off<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.980> right<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:27.120> can

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
damage off all right so now we can

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.089 
damage off all right so now we can
actually<00:02:27.360> go<00:02:27.540> onto<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.290> tele<00:02:28.590> pad<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:28.980> it's

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
actually go onto the tele pad so it's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.199 
actually go onto the tele pad so it's
not<00:02:29.190> gonna<00:02:29.310> work<00:02:29.459> straightaway<00:02:29.909> as<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.090> can

you<00:03:10.079> went<00:03:10.319> into<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.590> portal<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.220> think<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you went into a portal I think that is

you went into a portal I think that is
really<00:03:12.390> cool<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.870> does<00:03:13.049> actually<00:03:13.260> make

really cool and it does actually make
some<00:03:13.769> sounds<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.370> next<00:03:15.150> time<00:03:15.359> we<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.540> into<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
some sounds so next time we go into the

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.800 
is go into this one and I'm gonna do
remove<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.380> let's<00:04:55.620> do<00:04:55.860> t2<00:04:56.699> which<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.570> top

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
remove and let's do t2 which is the top

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.650 
remove and let's do t2 which is the top
one<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.259> if<00:04:58.320> I<00:04:58.410> press<00:04:58.530> okay<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.970> think<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.509> might

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
one so if I press okay I think you might

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.450 
one so if I press okay I think you might
need<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.870> press<00:05:01.020> save<00:05:01.320> I'm<00:05:01.650> not<00:05:01.800> too<00:05:01.949> sure<00:05:02.190> I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
need to press save I'm not too sure I

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.640 
need to press save I'm not too sure I
think<00:05:02.639> that's<00:05:03.060> how<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:03.330> works<00:05:03.360> I'm<00:05:03.750> not<00:05:03.780> not

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
think that's how it works I'm not not

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.379 
think that's how it works I'm not not
exactly<00:05:05.100> sure<00:05:05.370> but<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.060> didn't<00:05:06.300> actually

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
exactly sure but it didn't actually

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.969 
exactly sure but it didn't actually
remove<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.169> I'm<00:05:07.259> not<00:05:07.289> too<00:05:07.560> sure<00:05:07.710> if<00:05:07.740> that's

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
remove it so I'm not too sure if that's

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.010 
remove it so I'm not too sure if that's
like<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.160> little<00:05:08.430> bug<00:05:08.669> or<00:05:09.030> glitch<00:05:09.240> or<00:05:09.810> anything

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
like a little bug or glitch or anything

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.520 
like a little bug or glitch or anything
like<00:05:10.259> that<00:05:10.289> because<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.919> did<00:05:11.220> remove<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.820> but

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
like that because I did remove it but

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.839 
like that because I did remove it but
nothing's<00:05:13.530> really<00:05:13.740> happening<00:05:14.190> maybe<00:05:14.430> if<00:05:14.699> I

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
nothing's really happening maybe if I

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.930 
nothing's really happening maybe if I
actually<00:05:15.090> remove<00:05:15.690> did<00:05:16.080> teleport<00:05:16.710> pad<00:05:17.009> so

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
actually remove did teleport pad so

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.670 
actually remove did teleport pad so
let's<00:05:18.090> go<00:05:18.180> back<00:05:18.210> into<00:05:18.660> creative<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.500> let's

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
let's go back into creative and let's

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.710 
let's go back into creative and let's
remove<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.220> one<00:05:20.430> that's<00:05:21.000> above<00:05:21.330> here<00:05:21.570> which

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
was called t2 so let's go down to the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.860 
was called t2 so let's go down to the
one<00:05:25.560> where<00:05:25.740> we<00:05:25.860> named<00:05:26.400> it<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.789> crazy<00:05:27.270> name<00:05:27.630> and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
one where we named it a crazy name and

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.480 
one where we named it a crazy name and
