00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
have the surfboard of the Silver Surfer

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.150 
have the surfboard of the Silver Surfer
and<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.570> Silver<00:04:05.780> Surfer<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.680> by<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.830> look

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
and the Silver Surfer and by a look

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.190 
and the Silver Surfer and by a look
simply<00:04:07.610> just<00:04:07.820> says<00:04:07.970> no<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.810> Deadpool

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
simply just says no and so Deadpool

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.410 
simply just says no and so Deadpool
retreats<00:04:09.560> back<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.549> what<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.790> do<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.239> we

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
retreats back and so what we do is we

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.509 
retreats back and so what we do is we
pick<00:04:11.600> up<00:04:11.660> with<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.049> Deadpool<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.920> some<00:04:13.130> kind<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
pick up with a Deadpool and some kind of

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.580 
pick up with a Deadpool and some kind of
a<00:04:13.610> facility<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.660> what's<00:04:14.900> happening<00:04:15.260> here<00:04:15.470> is

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
a facility and what's happening here is

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.810 
a facility and what's happening here is
it<00:04:15.739> seems<00:04:15.950> as<00:04:16.100> though<00:04:16.250> they're<00:04:16.459> simply<00:04:16.790> I

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
it seems as though they're simply I

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.949 
it seems as though they're simply I
guess<00:04:17.180> he's<00:04:17.299> talking<00:04:17.540> with<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.690> group<00:04:17.870> of

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
guess he's talking with a group of

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.020 
guess he's talking with a group of
people<00:04:18.140> or<00:04:18.410> somebody<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.950> talking<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.519> what

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
people or somebody is talking and what

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.250 
people or somebody is talking and what
they're<00:04:20.150> saying<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.720> they're<00:04:21.049> simply

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
they're saying is that they're simply

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.020 
they're saying is that they're simply
trying<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.530> take<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.830> day<00:04:21.859> by<00:04:22.190> day<00:04:22.220> they're

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
trying to take it day by day they're

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.180 
trying to take it day by day they're
simply<00:04:23.300> trying<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.660> try<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.470> go<00:04:24.710> day<00:04:24.890> by<00:04:25.070> day

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
simply trying to try to go day by day

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.190 
simply trying to try to go day by day
dealing<00:04:25.669> with<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.390> guess<00:04:26.630> it's<00:04:26.780> new<00:04:26.990> role

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
dealing with this I guess it's new role

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080 
dealing with this I guess it's new role
that<00:04:27.350> they<00:04:27.500> play<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.010> what<00:04:28.520> we<00:04:28.640> learn<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.030> that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
that they play and what we learn is that

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.570 
that they play and what we learn is that
this<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.390> actually<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.810> group<00:04:30.200> that's<00:04:30.470> meeting

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
this is actually a group that's meeting

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.770 
this is actually a group that's meeting
because<00:04:31.580> they're<00:04:31.729> all<00:04:31.880> former<00:04:32.300> heralds<00:04:32.690> of

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
because they're all former heralds of

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.230 
because they're all former heralds of
