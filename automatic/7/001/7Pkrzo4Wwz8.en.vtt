but<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.660> good<00:00:51.809> thing<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.680> preseason<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
but the good thing is the preseason and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
but the good thing is the preseason and
we<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we do have time to work on it and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.380 
we do have time to work on it and
corrected<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.309> find<00:00:57.120> our<00:00:57.270> two

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
corrected so that we can find our two

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970

inner<00:00:57.539> selves<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> referee<00:00:58.230> season<00:00:58.559> we

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
inner selves for the referee season we

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.170 
inner selves for the referee season we
definitely<00:00:59.370> need<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> rest<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> in-game
