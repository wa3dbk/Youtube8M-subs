car you don't get that with the virtual
display<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.569> be<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> lifesaver<00:02:26.319> because

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
display so it can be a lifesaver because

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.199 
display so it can be a lifesaver because
in<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> incident<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.610> might<00:02:27.819> look<00:02:28.000> down

something<00:02:28.930> might<00:02:29.200> jump<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.590> at<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.549> you

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
never know what might happen so

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.630 
never know what might happen so
sometimes<00:02:32.620> sometimes<00:02:33.010> these<00:02:33.190> things<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.549> be

a<00:02:33.670> lifesaver<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.290> another<00:02:35.500> example<00:02:35.680> of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
a lifesaver this is another example of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.789 
a lifesaver this is another example of
the<00:02:36.370> unit<00:02:37.209> displaying<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.440> particular

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
the unit displaying this particular

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.550 
the unit displaying this particular
display<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> believe<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.209> maybe<00:02:40.780> rpm<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.379> boost

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
display I believe is maybe rpm or boost

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.949 
display I believe is maybe rpm or boost
I'm<00:02:41.769> not<00:02:41.890> sure<00:02:42.099> anyway<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.180> again<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
I'm not sure anyway this is again the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.430 
I'm not sure anyway this is again the
square<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:45.599> reflectorized<00:02:46.599> material<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.349> the

window tint and the unit here projecting
on<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.940> window<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:55.299> we<00:02:55.720> swear<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:55.989> already

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
on the window so we swear that already

on the window so we swear that already
this<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:56.799> an<00:02:57.010> example<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:58.019> connection<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.739> in

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
this is an example of connection so in

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.309 
this is an example of connection so in
this<00:03:00.430> particular<00:03:00.640> shot<00:03:01.209> we'll<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.690> bring

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
this particular shot we'll just bring

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.780 
this particular shot we'll just bring
the<00:03:02.500> zoom<00:03:02.680> down<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:05.019> shows<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.890> unit<00:03:06.640> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the zoom down it shows that the unit is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.940 
the zoom down it shows that the unit is
correct<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.450> connected<00:03:08.170> directly<00:03:08.290> into<00:03:08.829> the
