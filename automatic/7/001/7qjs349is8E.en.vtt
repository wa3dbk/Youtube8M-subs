00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
parachute after all that's on it we

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.389 
parachute after all that's on it we
didn't<00:00:40.410> put<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> perish<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> pressure<00:00:41.160> goes

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
didn't put a perish the pressure goes

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.560 
didn't put a perish the pressure goes
right<00:00:41.670> over<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:43.170> happens<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
right over here and what happens if it

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
right over here and what happens if it
detects<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> rafting<00:00:46.110> behavior<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
detects the rafting behavior so if it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
detects the rafting behavior so if it
hit<00:00:47.309> something<00:00:47.550> let's<00:00:48.180> say<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> bird<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.840> wall

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
hit something let's say a bird a wall

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
hit something let's say a bird a wall
whatever<00:00:49.320> or<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.070> lose<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> control

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
whatever or if you just lose the control

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
whatever or if you just lose the control
and<00:00:51.329> started<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.230> control<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and started going out of control it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
and started going out of control it
flips<00:00:53.430> outside<00:00:53.850> abcess<00:00:54.870> upside<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
flips outside abcess upside down and the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
flips outside abcess upside down and the
partial<00:00:56.190> deploys<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> sentences

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
partial deploys so it kind of sentences

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
partial deploys so it kind of sentences
that<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> might<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> danger<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
protects itself by operating the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
protects itself by operating the
parachute<00:01:02.579> itself<00:01:02.850> yeah<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.750> new

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
parachute itself yeah your new

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
parachute itself yeah your new
investment<00:01:04.470> obviously<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.610> know<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
power extender I mean while a Wi-Fi
extender<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.119> control<00:01:18.619> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
extender so you can control the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
extender so you can control the
helicopter<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.030> receive<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> signal

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
helicopter also can receive the signal

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
helicopter also can receive the signal
for<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> video<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> couple<00:01:23.850> of

features<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.409> most<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.830> new<00:01:26.220> drones

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
features that most of the new drones

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
features that most of the new drones
trying<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> implement<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> old<00:01:28.439> ones

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
trying to implement and the old ones

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
trying to implement and the old ones
don't<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> auto<00:01:29.729> takeoff<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.340 
same gimbal because you know you can get
a<00:01:52.380> video<00:01:52.590> downlink<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.840> camera

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a video downlink but with that camera

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840 
a video downlink but with that camera
and<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.710> controller<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:56.549> control

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and this controller can actually control

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
and this controller can actually control
camera<00:01:57.299> itself<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> settings<00:01:58.530> straight

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
camera itself for the settings straight

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
camera itself for the settings straight
from<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.280> unlike<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.630> prodigy<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
from here unlike the go prodigy of the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.520 
from here unlike the go prodigy of the
control<00:02:01.649> from

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
control from

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.560 
control from
either<00:02:02.740> camera<00:02:03.340> itself<00:02:03.549> up<00:02:03.820> for<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.090> app<00:02:04.299> or

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
either camera itself up for the app or

either camera itself up for the app or
from<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.830> phone<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:07.000> what<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.330> like<00:02:07.630> about<00:02:07.810> this

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
from a phone and what I like about this

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.230 
from a phone and what I like about this
controller<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.160> as<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> choker<00:02:09.910> set

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
controller is that it as a choker set

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.760 
controller is that it as a choker set
the<00:02:10.330> monitor<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.319> controller<00:02:11.620> and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the monitor is in the controller and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.650 
the monitor is in the controller and
it's<00:02:11.860> also<00:02:12.010> got<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.370> nice<00:02:12.640> little<00:02:12.910> screen<00:02:13.420> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it's also got this nice little screen so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's also got this nice little screen so
if<00:02:13.720> you're<00:02:13.840> trying<00:02:14.080> outside<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.800> sunny

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
you're actually gonna be able to see

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.420 
you're actually gonna be able to see
what<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.630> guide<00:02:16.930> those<00:02:17.319> texts<00:02:18.220> does

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
what you can guide those texts does

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.970 
what you can guide those texts does
gives<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.790> shade<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.390> does<00:02:19.900> give<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.319> a

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
dying to our hands on one of these also

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.410 
dying to our hands on one of these also
cursed<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.239> quickly<00:02:37.750> clip-on<00:02:38.700> gods<00:02:39.700> so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.660 
cursed with the quickly clip-on gods so
when<00:02:40.570> you're<00:02:40.690> clarifying<00:02:41.170> inside<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.100> if<00:02:42.489> you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
when you're clarifying inside so if you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.270 
when you're clarifying inside so if you
flying<00:02:43.090> inside<00:02:43.480> obviously<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.530> height<00:02:44.920> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
flying inside obviously the height is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.240 
flying inside obviously the height is
the<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.060> know<00:02:46.150> limited<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.650> parachute

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the you know limited and the parachute

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.830 
the you know limited and the parachute
wouldn't<00:02:48.519> be<00:02:48.580> able<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.850> deploy<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.420> save<00:02:49.690> it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
wouldn't be able to deploy and save it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.110 
wouldn't be able to deploy and save it
so<00:02:50.290> with<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> guards<00:02:51.459> if<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.760> hit<00:02:51.910> something

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
so with the guards if you hit something

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.910 
so with the guards if you hit something
it<00:02:52.540> does<00:02:52.780> bounce<00:02:52.989> off<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.530> continue

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
it does bounce off and you continue

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.610 
it does bounce off and you continue
flying<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.550> still<00:02:55.330> get<00:02:55.450> protected<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.380> all<00:02:56.530> of
