00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.080
 Leonardo Drew: Travel and creation 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.300
 Gallery Vigo, London 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.660
 Ok, what are some of your problems? 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 I don't really understand it. 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.599
 Stoll Middle School 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.879
 How many students have you been? What year is it? 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.519
 Lower sixth grade 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.369
 How old is the sixth grade? 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.869
 Basically 17 years old 

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:33.529
 7 years old 

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:34.360
 No, it’s 17 years old. 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.380
 Oh, that's how it is 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.199
 I don’t really go out. 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.549
 It can be said that it is not often going out. 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.360
 Except for the recent period, I have been traveling everywhere. 

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.569
 Wandering around and receiving a lot of new information 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 So if you can let 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.739
 Your antenna, stick out 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.790
 You will find 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.879
 It is the part you need for this trip. 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.919
 do you know? 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.189
 This is why I have been traveling all the time. 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.470
 Just recently, I just returned from Lima, Peru. 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.040
 Also crossed the Nazca line 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.220
 Visited Cuba 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.119
 Madrid and Switzerland 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.960
 I am one by one 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.610
 Browse these cities 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600
 At this time I realized that I can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.710
 Under the premise of not affecting the work of the studio 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.310
 Separate the time spent in the studio 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.580
 Because in my heart 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.740
 Life is still going on and art is still going on 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.580
 Art is derived from experience 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.960
 Travel and understand the things themselves 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.630
 This is more or less 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.830
 Affect you 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.320
 I am very confident 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.760
 All parts of your body are recipients of information 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.200
 Light refracting on things 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.830
 The wind, from time to time, sometimes calm 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.729
 All these things are affecting you 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.760
 I am a visual artist. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.450
 I always have a way to pass my medium. 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.370
 Find the way to the world 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700
 What is said here is... 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.930
 This is the letter I wrote to my grandmother. 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.009
 Said above: "My trip to Japan is coming to an end..." 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
 Wow, this is a hand letter from my trip to Japan. 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.300
 "I am now at the airport ready to board the plane to Osaka" 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.819
 “These three months are very interesting” 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.819
 “In the first week, I was invited to dance with older ladies in town.” 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.889
 "Some women I guess are about to be 110 years old" (laugh) 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.380
 "But God, they can dance" (laugh) 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.900
 One of the places I always wanted to go is Japan. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.159
 I don't know why I have to go to Japan. 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.079
 But in 1997, I had the chance to go to Japan. 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.180
 "This part of Japan is portrayed by the real soul." 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.540
 "I cut sugar cane and ate pig's trotters" (laugh) 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.400
 "These are all soulful foods." 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.919
 When I was in Japan, I was looking for 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.010
 How to make colors in a natural way 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.620
 "The color on the beach is too unreal." 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.580
 "The color of the water is blue and green." 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.760
 "And the color of the sand is white, white, white" 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.279
 This is what I have learned. 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.379
 However, when I go deep into the spiritual level, 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.359
 Everything is like a Vientiane update 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.999
 The exact reason why I ended my creation was 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.609
 I have to do something 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.139
 Papermaking learned there 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.669
 Ended the work at the garment factory 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.709
 Even so, I did not draw any conclusions when I was in Japan. 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.799
 I know that I should open the door. 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.739
 Go and find out 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.780
 The total source of opportunities is waiting for you to explore 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.200
 However, as a recipient of information 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 I want to do my best to absorb the most information. 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.620
 Do my best to learn the most 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.600
 At the same time, I also want to do my best to spread as much as possible to the general public. 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.300
 As long as you are open-minded and have no end to learning, your journey of life will never end.
