00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 root of the huge but still here 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.289
 with this top and hair and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 she does need extra care and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.390
 It is also clear that my dark side 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 will thank you very much for receiving a beautiful 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
 of reconstruction 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 Now I'm at a stage like this. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 even reconstruct hair from treating the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.320
 hair because you know I 'm already in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 end of transition i suffered cut 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 chemist and it has been a long time since 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.879
 take back the lights for the health of my hair 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 huh 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.879
 not that on the road but me for example 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.879
 that go out in the bluish black hair pro 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
 platinum has no hair that does not suffer 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 with all the care 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 my hair had an hour that ended 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.220
 suffering yes 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.320
 now its time to treat your hair 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 rebuild and grow clear 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.189
 So girls are here in my hand for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 line of cellular nutrition with flora 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.170
 right this ball is very good too 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.570
 like all the others of that brand I think 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 very good even and here it says it's a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.710
 Concentrated fluid restructuring the name 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.600
 he says he restructures so he restructures 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 the fiber of your hair 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.900
 here he's just saying he's a series 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.190
 professional 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.690
 end point does not say which 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.020
 special components he has nothing here 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.990
 in the composition has many chemical names 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.480
 It is very similar to the chemical names and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.250
 any product you are looking at 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.460
 names are very similar 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.790
 and so we want lay people not people 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.490
 can understand right what is the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 miraculous additive for reconstruction 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.110
 here in case 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.900
 so I know it does very well for the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 my hair is not my hair when I 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 step she I do not feel without hair 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.239
 dismantle as it cuts the wide line 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.120
 intensive hydration also this 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.670
 I feel like a very 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.030
 Good when I pass is Sam Bunny. 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.900
 But it's not her goal. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.660
 Her goal is to restructure her hair. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.090
 is to rebuild your daughter then not 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 I forget when you wear this color 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.739
 line 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.620
 You will pass the fence and in a park. 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.850
 lu is very important mainly 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.850
 this reconstruction stage you want 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.380
 actually achieve fiber interior 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.230
 You do not want to be alone in the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.570
 surface you want product to penetrate 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.420
 even hair then you have that will not 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.780
 same mecha for mecha is to make a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.150
 much better effect on your hydration 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.450
 welcome here also does not say the time of 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.299
 of action she talks to pass 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.820
 after washing the hair or that 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.070
 the simplest thing in the world you there 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.340
 your normal shampoo hair that you 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.860
 she is accustomed , she has a glove 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.720
 mix by the hair can already arrive here 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.370
 the manufacturer does not tell the time 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.250
 reaction then means that air of 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.799
 fast because if I want to leave less 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.960
 One minute I can let it go 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.110
 play his part 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.840
 same way and this is a ball has a 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.640
 Special little thing that I love the smell 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.490
 her very sweet very sweet even seems 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.040
 who does not know there babalu that must much 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.520
 delicious is very sweet, even smelling 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.700
 Come in, it's delicious and she 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.940
 stay some time in my way result 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.740
 it in my hair after drying is this 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.500
 Boy is that the last time I used 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.870
 her hair and this is an old passion 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.690
 I've been using since when I started to 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.690
 stay blond and I love I did not open 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.550
 Mandela is very good even to keep the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.370
 healthy hair mainly me 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.980
 I came from bluish or platinum black hair 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 I was not platinum for one of the months 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.560
 Then I kept making lights. 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.830
 so my hair really did 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.050
 stay in a certain health because of the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.210
 reconstructions that I always do in it 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.970
 so it's super important if you always 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.470
 brunette you being blonde is important 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.550
 rebuild your hair because the hair 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.900
 always suffers in fashion brush scrub 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.750
 the sun and the sea and girls it costs $ 9 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.970
 in my hair yields three applications and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.520
 For me it's really worth it because she is 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.729
 very 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.099
 good table so far not use another one for 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.289
 better line for reconstruction than 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.690
