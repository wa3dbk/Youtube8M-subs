00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.379
 abdul has lived long years one day said 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.000
 my hour has arrived is written to 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.009
 you my children 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.939
 I leave my camels that are my only 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:25.029
 valuable possessions to the greater to and 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.400
 He left half of my camels to Faruk 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.000
 a quarter and my little son 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.070
 mustafa a fifth part when you know 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.340
 handle fractions you will be able to 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.159
 open the roads in life after the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.159
 old man died was the will of God 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.360
 Abdul's will soon be 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.230
 became a problem because they 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.380
 he had left 19 camels 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.900
 al and I was tormented if I'm going to have 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.350
 half of 19 I will need half 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.350
 camel 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.739
 Faruk said he was puzzled 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.360
 that I have a quarter but what is 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.360
 the fourth part of 19 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.530
 Mustafa meditated inwardly at the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 name of the prophet as I am going to divide a 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.850
 camel in five parts 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.189
 then your uncle walks by and uses a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.390
 prudent and wise man riding on his 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.390
 old canella leo 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.759
 and he was as generous as wise and he 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.759
 offered to solve the problem 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 he even offered to his adored 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 kernel to add it to the flock of abdul 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.140
 they said we can not accept your 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.780
 generous help but he insisted and so he 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.050
 added the camel to the 19 camels of 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.050
 artur 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 with 20 camels the problem was easy 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.990
 and soon he saw that his half of 20 were 10 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 hair 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 it was the turn of Faruk who took 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 the fourth part of 20 his 5 camels 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.540
 They were delighted to not have been 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.299
 divided 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.579
 the fifth part of 20 are 4 so 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.579
 Mustafa took the best of the rest 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.819
 the old wise jussÃ  stayed with his 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.819
 faithful I believe 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.870
 because fractions were not added without 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.180
 the extra camel 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.200
 and because I think it influenced both the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.200
 testament of aptur
