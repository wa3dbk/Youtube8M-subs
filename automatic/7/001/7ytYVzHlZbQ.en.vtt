00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.280
 hong hong and luis and i was 14 years old i was 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.469
 a big fan of lego trumpets since the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.390
 start of the beta release but this 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.180
 match changed my point of view I was 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.070
 scared scared by this part shone 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 by this game wii of what happened 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.250
 since 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.960
 I always considered myself a 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.220
 happy person with a good sense of 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.910
 humor and I'm really going a lot 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.369
 smokers 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.989
 until that happens from 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 a lot of basta clips these last 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.649
 time but I found that she was doing 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.840
 clubs in December we were too 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.890
 good and too scared to be true eh 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.200
 alright I am a silver ranked player 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.210
 blocked with and feeder editors bel and 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.130
 well brushed his darkness not letting go 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.500
 it's never like a nightmare I 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.290
 keep thinking about it is the party a 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.270
 everything changed so I climb my rankings 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.100
 solo ku I took medium nursery 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.450
 as usual and we know the brick 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.670
 order in case something epic 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.130
 will arrive in the party actually he got 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.210
 spent something nothing epic is 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.320
 rather something terrifying 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.909
 when I selected the trÃ¨che it was 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.770
 rather strange was not his 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.930
 when I want to click on him like 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.520
 if he missed the small chips we think 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.229
 that a party how did I start 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.150
 feel uncomfortable as if some 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.580
 thing you shut up makes you spin for 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.799
 see if all that sometimes you can 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.330
 as if someone is hiding if we go 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.180
 hold their breath and make 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.909
 hear fantasy noises which 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.900
 could not be noisy 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.670
 to buy but ward and start to 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.350
 advance on the mid to burn someone 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.990
 or use my burial she is 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.840
 beautiful but it was not my team they 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 have raised yesterday but me very shocking 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.640
 ie the cold that kills 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.560
 I had never heard before sentences 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.080
 with me much more currencies than 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.189
 usually so demonic that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.659
 other people would have wanted and a 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.460
 computer but I have not made the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.510
 music stopped 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 youtube its recent to work 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.159
 normally the sound is not cut 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 I did not want to leave the EU I'm not 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.400
 not a kit hours it's just someone 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 who knows the cornbread these kids to 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.970
 imaginations what she did not stop 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.219
 of climb by trisha brown just as for 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.549
 got out yesterday's fog it was a 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.630
 option 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.670
 brief opposing the young leader 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.490
 you can not hide from us 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 we are the windows I was 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.210
 I am horrified by beating too 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.810
 blackened very nice a new file 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.370
 sound wrote the need to hear 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.770
 no doubt 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.870
 I panicked I try to cut game in 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.090
 vain often cool the use 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.880
 climbing appeared obvious you can not t 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.500
 chapet killed in the chasm despite the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.500
 foreign sentences he had pronounced 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.970
 the win our eye coach likes 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.830
 you have you can visit but he is going 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.520
 not look like to simulate rather than 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.980
 a screenshot 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.660
 he's touched all the time when 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.250
 my big bath touch the cereals 13 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.540
 10 levine here you struggles will not escape I 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.280
 felt more and more comfortable and 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.740
 of excuses as if it had been the times 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.050
 nomadic but each considered so 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.210
 I continued to play or the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.890
 music 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.270
 win the game we do not win 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.530
 like a series of village festivals it's 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.820
 the game this year it's also I 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.740
 reignite and I did not want my team 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.140
 lose because of me everything was normal 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.550
 I gave myself I stood in the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.430
 spawn I was not dead in the meantime 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.480
 luckily good score was 3 0 18 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.510
 when I clicked right Belgian says 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.340
 finally here you are I thought I had lost 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.740
 again it was not a coincidence 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 it could not be rotated 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.070
 just to check that there was 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.840
 nobody in my room my team it was 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.830
 well done we saw the baron and 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.240
 winner prevails 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 we were going to win against the use 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.790
 big in the base and it will not come to him 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.060
 night he threw himself into the enemy base 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.910
 shouting you will not change me I 'll 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.950
 doing nothing except watch which 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.110
 I spit again we are he wins 1 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.020
 before I can reconnect I 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.290
 look at a history seen facts not 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.459
 had effects containing his suitcases and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.660
 of effects on the widmore hand 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.700
 I'm going to make sense to them 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.910
 studies record large loads 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.720
 have some time link has changed 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.990
 I was nervous about dismissing it 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.990
 part the replay how that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.390
 I 'm crying because the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.760
 part starts to cry because is there 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.870
 for the date was not the fault of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.240
 Summoner there was something 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.960
 else something strange ever 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.060
 played at seven map 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.920
 if we were a granny a bridge 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.480
 black and the texture of the champions 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.280
 did not appear except that of 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.170
 nocturnal and ch traits in 30 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.250
 second one to scare one says 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.480
 politely that i cut the game i'm 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.860
 how much pace and I'm ready but everything 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.320
 what was in my campaign I 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.730
 all done to forget this part 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.650
 unfortunately it's hard to him whatever 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.020
 thing that we always think of as 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.310
 we always end up going away 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.990
 everywhere I looked I thought I was seeing 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600
 something all time noises 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.620
 strange and you a strange I was running 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.990
 at the top of the stairs to be 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.450
 president but the texture of the demons 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.500
 against civilians and not silhouettes 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.130
 black 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.530
 nothing more nothing less saclay ben that 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.740
 took me my will book my ability to 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.470
 I 'm not even sure I'm wanting 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.250
 that I'm dead someone to hear 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.230
 we call for help 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.480
 but I know that there will be someone 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.260
 able to read my story I have who 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.210
 changed my life 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.320
 story that changed my will to 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.980
 live my will to avoid the will 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.980
 to stop my party
