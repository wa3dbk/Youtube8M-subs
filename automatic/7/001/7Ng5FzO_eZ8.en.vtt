walk<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> stairs<00:00:28.830> movie<00:00:29.310> right<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> we've

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
walk the stairs movie right and we've

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
walk the stairs movie right and we've
learned<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.160> twelve<00:00:32.489> keys<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.969> at

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
learned that in all twelve keys or at

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.670 
learned that in all twelve keys or at
least<00:00:33.210> been<00:00:33.390> exposed<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.290> twelve<00:00:34.620> keys

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
least been exposed to it all twelve keys

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.090 
least been exposed to it all twelve keys
were<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> expect<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.100> some

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
were not that expect to do it but some

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
were not that expect to do it but some
keys<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.489> easier<00:00:38.730> than<00:00:38.790> others<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.420> well<00:00:39.690> but

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
keys are easier than others as well but

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.610 
keys are easier than others as well but
the<00:00:40.559> pattern<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> always<00:00:41.280> root<00:00:41.670> third<00:00:42.210> fifth

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
the pattern is always root third fifth

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.810 
the pattern is always root third fifth
sixth<00:00:43.620> seventh<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.789> down

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sixth seventh and then back down

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
sixth seventh and then back down
whatever<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> okay<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.500> we're<00:00:46.680> using<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
whatever it is okay and we're using the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.670 
whatever it is okay and we're using the

for that walk the stairs movie which is
very<00:00:54.210> traditional<00:00:54.480> okay<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.370> learned<00:00:56.579> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
very traditional okay so we learned that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
very traditional okay so we learned that
pattern<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.170> learned<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> not

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
pattern and we learned that we can not

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.569 
pattern and we learned that we can not
only<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> single<00:00:59.969> note<00:01:01.340> we<00:01:02.340> could<00:01:02.460> do

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
only do it as a single note we could do

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.149 
only do it as a single note we could do
it<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.969> octave<00:01:05.450> and<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.919 

what<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.179> a<00:01:12.270> broken-off<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.810> by

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
what we do this is a broken-off you by

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.419 
what we do this is a broken-off you by
the<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.469> it<00:01:13.499> either<00:01:13.770> steady<00:01:14.189> like

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
the way you can do it either steady like

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.480 
the way you can do it either steady like
this<00:01:14.609> standing<00:01:15.119> standing<00:01:15.450> standing<00:01:15.689> standing

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
this standing standing standing standing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
this standing standing standing standing
see<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.700> notes<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.119> equal<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.749> can

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
see all notes are equal or you can

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
see all notes are equal or you can
syncopated<00:01:19.409> long<00:01:19.649> short<00:01:20.130> long<00:01:20.189> long

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
syncopated long short long long

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.559 
syncopated long short long long
so<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.619> another<00:01:22.920> variety<00:01:23.609> whatever

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
so there's another variety whatever

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.959 
so there's another variety whatever
whatever<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.109> like<00:01:25.259> okay<00:01:25.679> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.700> last

whatever you like okay and then last

whatever you like okay and then last
time<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.539> took<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.530> easy<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.969> hand

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
time we took a very easy right hand

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.959 
time we took a very easy right hand
pattern<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:31.709> we<00:01:31.890> learned<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.459> was<00:01:32.609> simply

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
pattern and we learned it it was simply

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.999 
pattern and we learned it it was simply
you<00:01:33.479> play<00:01:33.719> them<00:01:33.959> if<00:01:34.289> you're<00:01:34.530> playing<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you play them if you're playing this in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
you play them if you're playing this in
the<00:01:35.069> key<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.250> C<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.090> play<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.450> C<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.380> C

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the key of C then you play the C the C

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.669 
the key of C then you play the C the C
octave<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> slide<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.789> G<00:01:39.060> flat<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.539> G

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
octave and you slide off G flat to G

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.410 
octave and you slide off G flat to G
with<00:01:40.679> your<00:01:40.829> fifth<00:01:41.039> finger<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> play<00:01:45.209> that

with your fifth finger and you play that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.449 
with your fifth finger and you play that
in<00:01:45.569> some<00:01:45.840> rhythm<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.259> eight<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.189> doesn't

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
in some rhythm with eight it doesn't

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:48.910 
in some rhythm with eight it doesn't
have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.909> only<00:01:48.030> rhythm<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.629> use

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
have to be the only rhythm you can use

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.309 
have to be the only rhythm you can use
you<00:01:49.920> could<00:01:50.069> go<00:01:53.360> depending<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.079> what

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
you could go depending on you know what

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:02.169 
you could go depending on you know what
kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> sound<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.399> went

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.910 

and<00:02:03.179> you<00:02:03.270> use<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and you use that on when the when the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
and you use that on when the when the
chord<00:02:05.429> is<00:02:05.579> C<00:02:05.609> and<00:02:05.879> when<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> court<00:02:06.239> is<00:02:06.299> f<00:02:06.509> then

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
chord is C and when the court is f then

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.160 
chord is C and when the court is f then
when<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> chord<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.379> G<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.220> move<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.549> on<00:02:09.170> one

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
when the chord is G you move up on one

to go with it a lot of it can be just

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.110 
to go with it a lot of it can be just
discovered<00:04:00.790> by<00:04:01.230> experimenting<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.560> okay
