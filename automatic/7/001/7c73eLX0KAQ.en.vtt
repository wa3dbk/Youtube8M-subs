00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
centimeter that's right the spectrum

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.300 
centimeter that's right the spectrum
that's<00:04:20.199> better<00:04:20.500> right<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:21.040> could<00:04:21.190> almost

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
that's better right so you could almost

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.060 
that's better right so you could almost
have<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.760> have<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.330> opposite<00:04:22.720> step<00:04:23.110> all<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
have to have the opposite step all the

way up for like null or zero energy
typing<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.479> then<00:04:28.630> it's<00:04:28.960> already<00:04:29.350> controlled

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
typing and then it's already controlled

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280
