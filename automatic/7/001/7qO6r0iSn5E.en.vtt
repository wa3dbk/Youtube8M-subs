00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.930
 hello everyone in this video I will show you 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.360
 how to remove a muffler 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.850
 specifically an original muffler 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:21.310
 the so-called padellino ours 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.160
 muffler is joined to the cylinder 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.570
 then through this collector us 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.330
 we will act on these screws e 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.129
 we will remove the muffler completely 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.749
 because it has a single body and then a 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.760
 bolted to the engine with a bully and 17 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:45.909
 so the only thing to do loosen i 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.699
 bolts of this manifold if instead 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.309
 we decided to mount a muffler 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:56.489
 different from the original as can be 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:59.679
 a classic torpedo like this or 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.569
 another type of muffler this is 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.409
 enough to completely remove 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:08.759
 this collector that will no longer serve us 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.229
 and we're going to mount the manifold 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:16.899
 specific for each muffler in this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:19.210
 so for a short run we will have the 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.189
 its collector for a course a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.920
 long we will have another malaval collector 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:29.500
 always puts the same idea to a model 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:35.770
 like this collector and muffler in 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.719
 this way then to remove the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.909
 our original muffler is one thing 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.189
 very simple 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.899
 we can do it even confining it 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.640
 on one side and maybe enough 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.640
 remove the wheel to work better 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.530
 let's loosen these two data that I have you 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:58.859
 said before and then let's relax this 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.859
 bolt that fixes the marmite to the engine 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.819
 to prevent our people from loosening up 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:29.870
 we always put one in the plain below 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:32.780
 and narrates in the split and now we go for 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:44.450
 move our salon is fixed 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:48.140
 the muffler to the engine we remove the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.250
 I always recommend our marble tiles 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.920
 brittle seals the change and 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.540
 we removed our muffler like 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.910
 you saw the muffler removed 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920
 original is very simple now I will make you 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.709
 see how maybe mount a muffler 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.140
 different with its collector then in 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.829
 this case we should instead like I have you 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.540
 said first remove this collector 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.390
 so we should have to move a little 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.850
 our headphones 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.150
 in the case instead of a long stroke engine 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.810
 the collector will be a little different but for 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.290
 facilitating work is perhaps worthwhile 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.540
 remove this bully 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.819
 of the shock absorber remove ours 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.799
 carbu carburetor and let down a little 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 the engine to be able to work better 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.370
 we want to remove our collector 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.980
 now we have removed our collector 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.930
 I recommend strictly seal 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:05.659
 always new and we are going to mount 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:09.019
 specific manifold for the muffler a 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.750
 advice that I give you once approached 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.030
 our data we do not go there tighten 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.799
 completely we leave everything temporary 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.329
 until we fixed the muffler 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:23.169
 to the engine so we can manage the 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.169
 position 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.370
 now we are going to attack ours 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:40.010
 machine always with a gasket 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:42.080
 new as you can see the fact of 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.260
 having left everything loose gives us 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:50.349
 way to manage the muffler well e 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.880
 to be able to fix it as we want here too 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.310
 we do not fix definitively 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.780
 now let's attach the bolt to the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 engine then all lined up 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.030
 it is verified that it is perfect we go to 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 tighten our bolt 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.770
 even here we don't pull straight away 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.630
 immediately after ascertaining that 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.470
 let's all be perfect we start pulling 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.760
 something from the cylinder then these and in 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.760
 last this bolt 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.759
 once fixed everything now I do 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.800
 see how to remove this muffler 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.779
 leaving the collector attached the 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.199
 cylinder we will stop these two 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:56.270
 bolts we loosen this by 17 e 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:06.889
 let's challenge the muffler because before 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:08.809
 we will have to mount our wheel like 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.389
 you can see this will always remain 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:14.300
 close to the engine enough to loosen 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.249
 the bolt and we insert the daisy 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.019
 this way you see 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:21.830
 now let's go and mount the wheel and then 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:24.199
 we reassemble our muffler now 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.019
 we put our wheel back we have 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:31.059
 staring at the marmot and now we go to 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:31.059
 tighten our bolt 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.129
 if instead we intended to mount 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.249
 other models of muffler the important a 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.860
 always fix the collector than that 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.349
 this will always remain for example 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.709
 muffler at his buttonhole always goes 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.930
 threaded this bolt and inserted into the 

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:53.300
 its collector so we wo n't have any more 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.399
 need to remove the wheel and it is 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.110
 just loosen the bolt here that 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:07:02.479
 parading for this video is everything 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.110
 keep following us and see you at 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.110
