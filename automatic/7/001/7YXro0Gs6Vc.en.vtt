these standoffs will one there's only

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.940 
these standoffs will one there's only
four<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.700> them<00:00:02.939> any<00:00:03.410> board<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.620> market

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
four of them any board on the market

four of them any board on the market
you're<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> need<00:00:05.430> more<00:00:05.609> than<00:00:05.670> just

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
you're going to need more than just

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.330 
you're going to need more than just
these<00:00:06.089> four<00:00:06.799> because<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> board<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.280> to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
these four because the board is going to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.919 
these four because the board is going to
extend<00:00:08.519> at<00:00:08.760> least<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.090> high<00:00:09.360> you're<00:00:09.780> going

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
extend at least this high you're going

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.320 
extend at least this high you're going
to<00:00:09.990> need<00:00:10.139> some<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.070> then<00:00:12.059> some

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
to need some up here and then some

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.160 
to need some up here and then some
boards<00:00:12.719> might<00:00:13.200> not<00:00:13.410> use<00:00:13.769> these<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.280> at<00:00:14.519> all

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
boards might not use these for at all

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.480 
boards might not use these for at all
the<00:00:16.170> holes<00:00:16.410> drilled<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> board<00:00:17.220> might

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the holes drilled on the board might

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
the holes drilled on the board might
actually<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.840> different<00:00:18.960> position<00:00:19.260> than

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
actually be in a different position than

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
actually be in a different position than
the<00:00:20.220> where<00:00:20.520> these<00:00:20.670> standoffs<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.300> put<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.600> so

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the where these standoffs are put in so

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
the where these standoffs are put in so
the<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.960> take

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the first thing we want to do is to take

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.790 
the first thing we want to do is to take
a<00:00:25.199> nut<00:00:25.470> driver<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.930> take<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> standoffs<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a nut driver and take the standoffs that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.520 
a nut driver and take the standoffs that
are<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> case<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:33.230> now<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> got

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
are in the case back out now if you got

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.760 
are in the case back out now if you got
a<00:00:34.559> photographic<00:00:34.950> memory<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.530> these

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
a photographic memory you can take these

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
a photographic memory you can take these
guys<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.719> set<00:00:40.050> your

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
guys out and you can set your

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.190 
guys out and you can set your
motherboard<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.219> case<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.510> eyeball

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
motherboard in the case and just eyeball

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.389 
motherboard in the case and just eyeball
what<00:00:43.500> holes<00:00:43.800> line<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.800> safe<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
what holes line up but the safe thing to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
what holes line up but the safe thing to
do<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> magic<00:00:49.079> marker<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:50.340> we're

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
do is to use a magic marker first we're

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
do is to use a magic marker first we're
going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> take<00:00:50.760> our<00:00:50.820> board<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.530> we're<00:00:52.530> just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
going to take our board and we're just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.250 
going to take our board and we're just
going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> jump<00:00:53.039> set<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> case

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
going to jump set it down in the case

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.060 
going to jump set it down in the case
don't<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
don't you have to set it all the way

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.910 
don't you have to set it all the way
down<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.430> case<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.090> need<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:58.620> take

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
down the case all we need to do is take

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.570 
down the case all we need to do is take
our<00:00:59.070> board<00:01:00.620> set<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:05.299> about<00:01:06.710> where<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.369> IO

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
our board set it down about where the IO

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
our board set it down about where the IO
will<00:01:09.240> line<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.770> i'm<00:01:10.860> doing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
will line up but you see what i'm doing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
will line up but you see what i'm doing
here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> i'm<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.090> lining<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> holes<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
here is i'm not lining up the holes that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.160 
here is i'm not lining up the holes that
are<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.840> i'm<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
are going to that i'm going to be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.249 
are going to that i'm going to be
putting<00:01:16.290> screws<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.970> reason<00:01:17.970> being<00:01:18.259> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
putting screws into reason being is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.800 
putting screws into reason being is
because<00:01:19.290> i'm<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> mark<00:01:20.460> these

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
because i'm just going to mark these

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
because i'm just going to mark these
with<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:21.990> magic<00:01:22.320> marker<00:01:22.680> sit<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.220> line

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
with my magic marker sit here if we line

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
with my magic marker sit here if we line
this<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.880> looks<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> topmost<00:01:25.170> hole<00:01:25.439> here

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this up looks like the topmost hole here

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
this up looks like the topmost hole here
and<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> hole<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.869> board's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and this hole here and this this board's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
and this hole here and this this board's
unusually<00:01:31.680> deep<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.150> looks<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.390> we're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
unusually deep so it looks like we're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.969 
unusually deep so it looks like we're
probably<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.439> use<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> one

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
probably going to actually use this one

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.440 
probably going to actually use this one
in<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> corner<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.030> behind<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
in the corner here right behind the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
in the corner here right behind the
three<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> half<00:01:36.869> days<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.340> looks<00:01:38.549> like

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
three and a half days and it looks like

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.389 
three and a half days and it looks like
another<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:41.720> ok<00:01:43.220> we're<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
another one right here ok we're going to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
another one right here ok we're going to
take<00:01:44.549> our<00:01:44.610> stand<00:01:44.909> offs<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> screw

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
take our stand offs we're going to screw

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.780 
take our stand offs we're going to screw
that<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> board<00:01:49.340> now<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> looks<00:01:50.579> like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that into the board now it looks like

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.139 
that into the board now it looks like
we've<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:51.840> three<00:01:52.770> four<00:01:53.130> five<00:01:53.159> six

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
we've got one two three four five six

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.920 
we've got one two three four five six
seven<00:01:55.079> eight<00:01:55.350> holes<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> parts<00:01:57.750> pack

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
seven eight holes so from the parts pack

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
seven eight holes so from the parts pack
that<00:01:58.200> comes<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> case<00:01:59.210> remember<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that comes with the case remember it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
that comes with the case remember it
comes<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> case<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> motherboard

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.200 
pulling out those standoffs all I'm
going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.520> screw<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
going to do is screw them in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.510 
going to do is screw them in
holes<00:02:10.240> have<00:02:11.240> my<00:02:11.530> magic<00:02:12.530> marker<00:02:12.980> markings<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
holes have my magic marker markings on

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.270 
holes have my magic marker markings on
them<00:02:14.620> obstructions<00:02:15.620> are<00:02:15.740> your<00:02:15.830> biggest<00:02:16.010> pain

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
them obstructions are your biggest pain

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.440 
them obstructions are your biggest pain
in<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.790> one<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> reasons<00:02:17.240> why<00:02:17.300> put

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
in it this is one of the reasons why put

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.030 
in it this is one of the reasons why put
the<00:02:17.480> motherboard<00:02:17.960> in<00:02:18.080> before<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> drives<00:02:18.770> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the motherboard in before the drives I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560 
the motherboard in before the drives I
mean<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.460> could<00:02:19.580> put<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> drives<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.210> before

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
mean you could put the drives in before

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.610 
mean you could put the drives in before
the<00:02:20.660> motherboard<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:24.230> good<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.560> a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the motherboard but it's good to have a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.580 
the motherboard but it's good to have a
clear<00:02:24.920> shot<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.490> bottom<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.910> case

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
clear shot to the bottom of the case

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.720 
clear shot to the bottom of the case
this<00:02:27.590> case<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.070> get<00:02:28.220> away<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.580> it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
this case you can get away with it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.980 
this case you can get away with it
better<00:02:28.850> than<00:02:29.060> other<00:02:29.210> cases<00:02:29.450> because<00:02:29.810> this

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
better than other cases because this

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.410 
better than other cases because this
thing<00:02:30.170> drop<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.500> right<00:02:30.620> off<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.980> got<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.310> is

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
thing drop it right off I got to do is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.260 
thing drop it right off I got to do is
take<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.190> slide<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.340> off<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.970> look<00:02:35.180> at

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
take that and slide that off and look at

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.670 
take that and slide that off and look at
that<00:02:35.390> now<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.050> got<00:02:36.200> all<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.410> room<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
that now you got all the room in the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.620 
that now you got all the room in the
world<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:39.230> doesn't<00:02:39.500> matter<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:41.360> board

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
world but it doesn't matter this board

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.330 
world but it doesn't matter this board
is<00:02:41.660> kind<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.960> an<00:02:42.050> unusual<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.710> it's<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> micro

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
is kind of an unusual one it's a micro

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.120 
is kind of an unusual one it's a micro
ATX<00:02:43.490> board<00:02:44.350> which<00:02:45.350> means<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.800> only<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.070> to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
ATX board which means it's only going to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.490 
ATX board which means it's only going to
go<00:02:46.310> down<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.910> far<00:02:47.210> that<00:02:47.690> part's<00:02:47.960> normal<00:02:48.380> for

go down this far that part's normal for

go down this far that part's normal for
a<00:02:48.530> micro<00:02:48.830> ATX<00:02:48.980> board<00:02:49.490> but<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.060> really<00:02:50.240> deep

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
a micro ATX board but it's really deep

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.290 
a micro ATX board but it's really deep
let's<00:02:51.830> boards<00:02:52.070> are<00:02:52.160> long<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.520> skinny<00:02:52.790> they<00:02:53.150> go

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
let's boards are long and skinny they go

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.850 
let's boards are long and skinny they go
this<00:02:53.480> way<00:02:53.660> they<00:02:53.810> give<00:02:53.960> you<00:02:54.020> all<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> slots<00:02:54.500> but

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
this way they give you all the slots but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.600 
this way they give you all the slots but
they<00:02:54.980> don't<00:02:55.130> go<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.370> far<00:02:55.550> out<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.650> I'm<00:02:58.520> gonna

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
they don't go this far out so I'm gonna

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
they don't go this far out so I'm gonna
double-check<00:02:58.880> these<00:02:59.210> I<00:02:59.420> want<00:02:59.570> to

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
double-check these I want to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.480 
double-check these I want to
over-tighten<00:02:59.840> them<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.530> want<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.830> screw

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
over-tighten them and just want to screw

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.330 
over-tighten them and just want to screw
them<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.730> by<00:03:01.850> hand<00:03:01.880> right<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:03.100> once<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.190> get

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
them in by hand right now once I get

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.380 
them in by hand right now once I get
them<00:03:04.460> all<00:03:05.740> somewhat<00:03:06.740> tight<00:03:07.210> I'm<00:03:08.210> going<00:03:08.300> to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
them all somewhat tight I'm going to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.170 
them all somewhat tight I'm going to
take<00:03:08.480> my<00:03:08.600> nut<00:03:08.750> driver<00:03:09.490> I'm<00:03:10.490> taking<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:10.940> guy's

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
take my nut driver I'm taking this guy's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.260 
take my nut driver I'm taking this guy's
down<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:13.010> twist<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.460> like<00:03:13.520> with<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> tips

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
down I just twist it like with the tips

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.580 
down I just twist it like with the tips
of<00:03:14.360> my<00:03:14.420> fingers<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.110> not<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.350> lot<00:03:15.560> of

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
of my fingers so it's not a lot of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.720 
of my fingers so it's not a lot of
torque<00:03:15.920> I'd<00:03:16.910> have<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.180> say<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.960> know<00:03:18.730> probably

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
torque I'd have to say you know probably

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.880 
torque I'd have to say you know probably
not<00:03:19.970> even<00:03:20.180> 23<00:03:20.360> foot<00:03:20.750> pounds<00:03:21.170> again<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.770> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
not even 23 foot pounds again it's that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.750 
not even 23 foot pounds again it's that
little<00:03:23.080> really<00:03:24.080> slight<00:03:24.380> twist<00:03:27.670> drop<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
little really slight twist drop the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.350 
little really slight twist drop the
board<00:03:28.970> in<00:03:29.180> here<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.220> line<00:03:31.220> up<00:03:31.250> my<00:03:31.520> 00<00:03:31.670> first<00:03:32.210> in

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
board in here and line up my 00 first in

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.250 
board in here and line up my 00 first in
the<00:03:32.450> back<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.950> then<00:03:34.130> drop<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.400> in

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the back like that and then drop it in

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.460 
the back like that and then drop it in
okay<00:03:36.760> now<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.050> where<00:03:39.170> your<00:03:39.320> paper

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
okay now this is where your paper

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.760 
okay now this is where your paper
watchers<00:03:39.890> would<00:03:40.040> normally<00:03:40.430> go<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:42.290> lot<00:03:42.650> of

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
watchers would normally go a lot of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.930 
watchers would normally go a lot of
boards<00:03:43.010> you'll<00:03:43.130> see<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.430> got<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.730> silver

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
boards you'll see you got the silver

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.580 
boards you'll see you got the silver
ring<00:03:44.300> here<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:45.020> kind<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.260> like<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.410> little

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
ring here it's kind of like a little

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.470 
ring here it's kind of like a little
protective<00:03:45.980> area<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.640> board<00:03:46.940> they<00:03:47.270> know

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
protective area on the board they know

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.580 
protective area on the board they know
there's<00:03:47.720> going<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.960> be<00:03:47.990> a<00:03:48.080> screw<00:03:48.380> going

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
there's going to be a screw going

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.700 
there's going to be a screw going
through<00:03:48.830> there<00:03:48.950> anyway<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:51.170> know<00:03:51.290> why

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
through there anyway so you know why

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.220 
through there anyway so you know why
bother<00:03:51.890> with<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.160> paper<00:03:52.340> washers<00:03:53.050> you'll<00:03:54.050> see

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
bother with the paper washers you'll see

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.020 
bother with the paper washers you'll see
this<00:03:54.380> hole<00:03:54.590> right<00:03:54.770> here<00:03:55.010> doesn't<00:03:55.850> have<00:03:55.970> a

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
this hole right here doesn't have a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.490 
this hole right here doesn't have a
silver<00:03:56.270> ring<00:03:56.360> on<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.080> say<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
silver ring on it and you say that I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.250 
silver ring on it and you say that I
also<00:03:57.680> didn't<00:03:58.100> put<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.750> standoff<00:03:59.750> underneath<00:04:00.110> it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
also didn't put a standoff underneath it

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.690 
also didn't put a standoff underneath it
either<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:01.010> doesn't<00:04:01.310> seem<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.520> be<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> very

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
either that doesn't seem to be a very

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.140 
either that doesn't seem to be a very
play<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.330> very<00:04:02.690> safe<00:04:02.900> place<00:04:02.930> for<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.440> standoff<00:04:04.150> so

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
play a very safe place for a standoff so

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.460 
play a very safe place for a standoff so
I'm<00:04:05.420> just<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.720> leave<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.900> out<00:04:06.110> besides

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
I'm just going to leave it out besides

you're<00:04:06.770> not<00:04:06.890> really<00:04:07.100> installing<00:04:07.580> anything<00:04:07.760> on

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
you're not really installing anything on

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.490 
you're not really installing anything on
this<00:04:08.060> far<00:04:08.300> far<00:04:08.600> corner<00:04:08.990> of<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.080> board<00:04:09.350> that's

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
this far far corner of the board that's

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.900 
this far far corner of the board that's
going<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.710> make<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:09.920> board<00:04:10.190> flex<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:10.670> much

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
going to make that board flex so much

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.570 
going to make that board flex so much
that<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.270> would<00:04:11.390> be<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.510> concern<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:13.340> once

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
that that would be a concern so once

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.910 
that that would be a concern so once
that<00:04:13.670> is<00:04:14.000> done<00:04:14.140> where<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.230> can<00:04:15.320> now<00:04:15.440> screw<00:04:15.770> in

that is done where you can now screw in

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.979 
that is done where you can now screw in
the<00:04:16.010> motherboard<00:04:17.080> okay

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
have a magnetic screwdriver now when I

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.939 
have a magnetic screwdriver now when I
tighten<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.680> down<00:04:33.810> I'm<00:04:34.810> only<00:04:35.229> going<00:04:35.710> to

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
it's still loose because if you just put

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.260 
it's still loose because if you just put
these<00:04:39.940> screws<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.509> loose<00:04:41.849> line<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:43.030> all<00:04:43.120> the
