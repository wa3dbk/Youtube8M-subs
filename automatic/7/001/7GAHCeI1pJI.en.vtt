00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.530
 every day I wake up knowing that 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.310
 more people will try to save 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.310
 more enemies I will do 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.960
 and it's only a matter of time 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 before I clash with those who have more 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.320
 powers 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.620
 than I can defeat 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.250
 sorry I'm late 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 traffic problems 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 given the traffic problems they have to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.480
 dealing with know with someone who shoots you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.480
 on 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.330
 yes of course they have to do 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.330
 have to do yes 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.739
 to those who keep an eye on why 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.720
 this is the question of the day there is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 something you're not telling me aunt may 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.280
 once I told you that the secret didn't 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 it costs 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 not even the truth not all the stories 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.780
 happy ending 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.780
 but what 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 but what's bigger than you 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.770
 I made a choice 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.770
 this is my way 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.189
 soon all this city 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.100
 they will know what it feels like to live in a 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 world 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.929
 without power 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.929
 mercilessly 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.240
 without spider man
