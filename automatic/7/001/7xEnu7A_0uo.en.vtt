00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.590
 and several friends who have had children we 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.040
 they reported that they had caught 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.050
 this option then then I decided to have 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.349
 more information because I thought that 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 I had more things than other companies 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.740
 offered 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.110
 lately they are doing 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.180
 discoveries that can solve 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.180
 possible problems that come in a 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.610
 future now it is better to insure and have 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.769
 that possibility so that later on in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.579
 If it can be used, you can have 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.220
 the appointment of how he is progressing 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.399
 lately the studies we assume that 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.839
 in an average of 10-15 years you can 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.839
 do almost anything 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.440
 because the visit is lived has been very 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.860
 positive 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 we expected a normal route 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.560
 We did not expect anything in particular and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.380
 the truth that has surprised us by the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.990
 I try because the doctor was super 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.150
 involved explaining everything we have seen 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.630
 all the facilities the girls like 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.350
 they handled the blood and everything very well 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.990
 we have also really seen the way 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.030
 to work and really what is it that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.890
 do with him with this material and the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.010
 truth is that now we know how to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.220
 uses and that is really the way of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.860
 work is quite methodical and it is 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.690
 positive for to put people face 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.990
 in which you are with depositing your 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.990
 trust 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 coming here is always an experience 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.560
 positive and see how everything works 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 any questions will be resolved and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.130
 surely one hundred percent will throw 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.130
 to move forward with this option
