00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
daydream feature so if go into the

daydream feature so if go into the
settings<00:03:10.130> area<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:11.000> go<00:03:11.900> down<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.410> like<00:03:12.940> here

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
settings area here go down to like here

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.640 
settings area here go down to like here
you<00:03:13.970> go<00:03:14.300> here<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.900> lock<00:03:15.050> screen<00:03:15.200> style

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you go here have the lock screen style

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.979 
you go here have the lock screen style
so<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.459> see<00:03:16.610> here<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.090> widget<00:03:17.570> current

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
so you can see here on widget current

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.880 
so you can see here on widget current
which<00:03:18.200> i<00:03:18.350> think<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.980> new<00:03:19.160> variant<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.890> you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
which i think is the new variant and you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.690 
which i think is the new variant and you
can<00:03:22.070> pick<00:03:22.310> between<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.300> many<00:03:23.570> dough<00:03:24.940> and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
can pick between that many dough and

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.170 
can pick between that many dough and
then<00:03:28.700> also<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.780> go<00:03:30.290> back<00:03:30.530> here<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.430> go<00:03:32.120> to

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
then also if we go back here and go to

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.170 
then also if we go back here and go to
maybe<00:03:32.650> there<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.920> they<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.700> daydream

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
maybe there we go they have the daydream

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.390 
maybe there we go they have the daydream
feature<00:03:37.600> which<00:03:38.600> was<00:03:38.959> new<00:03:39.290> update<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.950> android

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
feature which was new update in android

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.990 
feature which was new update in android
4.2<00:03:40.760> i<00:03:40.880> think<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:43.010> isn't<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:43.640> updates

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
4.2 i think so that isn't in you updates

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.670 
4.2 i think so that isn't in you updates
if<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.330> do<00:03:44.450> know<00:03:44.630> any<00:03:44.810> more<00:03:45.050> updates<00:03:45.140> of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
if you do know any more updates of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.509 
if you do know any more updates of
course<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.820> can<00:03:47.060> let<00:03:47.269> people<00:03:47.300> know<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:49.280> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
course you can let people know but the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.150 
course you can let people know but the
cool<00:03:49.760> thing<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:50.209> think<00:03:50.300> is<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.560> most

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
cool thing I think is and the most

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.830 
cool thing I think is and the most
useful<00:03:52.400> here<00:03:52.880> it's<00:03:53.060> definitely<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.750> you

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
useful here it's definitely that you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.560 
useful here it's definitely that you
know<00:03:53.989> have<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.830> lot<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> quick<00:03:55.580> toggles<00:03:56.120> here

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
know have a lot of quick toggles here

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.259 
know have a lot of quick toggles here

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
that is built in I would prefer that if

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.640 
that is built in I would prefer that if
they<00:03:59.480> were<00:03:59.510> instantly<00:04:00.109> when<00:04:00.380> you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650
