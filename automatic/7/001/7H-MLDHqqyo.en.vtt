00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.209
 So now I want to show you how to make a ham therefore money 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.079
 Phishing exemplary Viet air masses solid mesh 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.079
 and then the tight loop with the loop m 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.079
 you have to knit with a loop just like when 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.680
 Kloten made me believe that he has a bit of beach and he betrays him in the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.689
 left hand led the Norwegians Sweden 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.359
 Now Final Four have taken the questions quite a bit 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.600
 and she takes bath 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.410
 through the loop 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.610
 once again grace before the thread 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.990
 and 7 really loud 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.250
 We also had to do twelve air stitches 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.760
 even now they have to flee their money and now we put one more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.410
 Mesh as if the machine 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.180
 back 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.490
 do it with his stitches 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.940
 that's what I stand for with the NADA 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.500
 wash in the air so that two machines again above the NADA 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 lie 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 and a machine goes 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480
 had entertained 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.080
 we go with one behind the acts 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.380
 recently have Voigt 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.800
 and now we go with the NADA again before the Franks 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.210
 Gold fetch the thread through the two sleep 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.980
 I show Sepp Maier 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.180
 bribe with the needle in the air team two people back up 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.380
 a customer 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 see published with the fall behind 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.900
 with the still in questions 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.020
 and have through 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 when you're sleeping, pull 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.570
 once after 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.470
 a sting 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.090
 Get questions 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.650
 betrayed before 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.290
 and I stay weak 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 I will finish you once 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.169
 so now we are almost at the end of the series arrived 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.229
 now deep into the night last two machines it fixed stitches 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.859
 even the last little one I believed her 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.759
 Yes and no 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.499
 finished 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.499
 Now we see an air bottle as Penny Marshall 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.919
 you would put chopsticks you would already 2 0 some need it 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.629
 the height gets 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.669
 we turn the work live 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.099
 Now we are stuck with the brand 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.750
 not in the first slap but in the second dinghies for the first 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.109
 Team at the sea already crocheted knit crochet when she is here 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.070
 Would sting 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.049
 would you take a scam that we do not want 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.469
 We now put a normal fixed Mascher first 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.749
 Later at our stands knit piece we can also 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.090
 the first machine new air some you can 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.789
 he will disappear later in the night 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.429
 and the next her child he first fly water 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.619
 We are just like the fixed mesh some 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.489
 into the team 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.489
 Now we put the middle finger before the questions 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
 Holstein drive with the NADA 2 right 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:22.799
 against again with bonds in front of the thread 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.799
 and she would have believed in Berlin 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.479
 through the middle finger we have this loop behind 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.819
 and we always use the same finger 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.919
 here again 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.919
 The loop Emma is about the same size 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.599
 make a market slow 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.459
 in some cities 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.509
 Middle finger in front of the colors are the thread 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.479
 pick up 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.120
 Bring the colors once more through 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.499
 do not believe it 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.599
 and they can do well with these two fingers 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.599
 do not hold on to Hindu Kush 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.209
 I'll send you the first trip once more a bit more laboriously 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.109
 fiddly 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.109
 but that will be better afterwards 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.229
 you constantly forget about it 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.169
 back it goes with normal normal stitches without loop the linden the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.169
 Nursing home more no chance 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.909
 So we can go back under normal tight stitches 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.909
 they can already see how nice even energy swallow 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.479
 I will finish you once 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.909
 so we are now almost at the end of the hall arrived 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.969
 I'm lying the last machines 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.969
 as a solid mesh 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 and also this little I do not forget course here 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.210
 then they have to go in again 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.210
 otherwise this will still be decided 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.069
 we make an air bottle to steal 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.069
 and here's the second row of skiing 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.499
 For the first time, Seitz 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.089
 Ask FÃ¶rstemann 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.550
 but now it goes back with the loops 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.629
 submit a stinging middle finger 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.089
 go through and through Biella 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.120
 We have already practiced that enough 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.169
 I will finish you once 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.219
 Show nominal value 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.219
 how nicely even the loops look 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.789
 should the course he commuted 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.039
 make our last game open mesh 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.449
 and another one 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.449
 it is always nice 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.059
 a Wasa for the turn 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.839
 and back to work Rome 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.869
 and now they see already happening even the loops located 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.339
 depending on how far you want the curb I recommend that you between 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.009
 three and five such sleep insert 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.330
 if you want to use that firmly in cities or for the Herne degree 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.559
 later she showed him how to wash out of this life 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:03.939
 Mesh can emerge
