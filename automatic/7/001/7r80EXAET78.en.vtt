00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
many of you guys are wondering is it

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.520 
many of you guys are wondering is it
just<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.570> weak<00:05:12.720> version<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.230> Terron

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
just like the weak version of the Terron

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.740 
just like the weak version of the Terron
with<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.800> drone<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:15.030> needed<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.390> have<00:05:15.630> it

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
with a drone that you needed to have it

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.960 
with a drone that you needed to have it
as<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.870> high<00:05:16.110> level<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.680> it<00:05:17.190> does<00:05:17.400> not<00:05:17.550> deter<00:05:17.880> on

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
as a high level and it does not deter on

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.690 
as a high level and it does not deter on
does<00:05:18.120> not<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.420> full<00:05:18.630> HP<00:05:18.840> as<00:05:19.260> as<00:05:19.980> that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
does not have full HP as as that

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.190 
does not have full HP as as that
karabell<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.390> there's<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.720> big<00:05:21.990> difference

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
karabell so there's a big difference

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.500 
karabell so there's a big difference
than<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.190> also<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.910> tron<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.360> can

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
than that and also the tron you can

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.830 
than that and also the tron you can
summon<00:05:24.750> three<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:25.290> them<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.180> I<00:05:27.180> believe<00:05:27.600> when

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
summon three of them and I believe when

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.950 
summon three of them and I believe when
it<00:05:28.470> dies<00:05:28.710> at<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.220> other<00:05:29.310> three<00:05:29.550> won't<00:05:29.910> die<00:05:30.090> but

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
it dies at the other three won't die but
