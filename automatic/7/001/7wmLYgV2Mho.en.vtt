00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 the horrible night buses 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.789
 the buses equipped with a lowered floor no particularity 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:14.739
 special 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.789
 which allows to mechanically lower the bus 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.240
 at sidewalk 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.730
 to facilitate access for children of the elderly and mobile 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.140
 scaled down 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 hop aboard 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.959
 This bus measures 12 meters 20 from the UN and can carry more than 80 passengers 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.280
 to build the structure at the end of this bus we are steel bars 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.500
 stainless in a press that made a passion of 80 to 100 tons 2 it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 order the desired form 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.950
 we assemble the parts of the structure on a support frame called 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 mounting 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 electronic abra checks the quality of the work 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.560
 when the roof structures and the French side of the assemblies are 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 gathers for welding 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.290
 everything folds rotatable that allow easy access to all 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 the parts of the well which need to be welded 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.120
 when the poll is over for around 10 at the place 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.450
 the structure that can baptize to continue its way on the line of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 production 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.070
 meanwhile the stainless steel structure for the bus floor takes 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 form 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.520
 once completed it is placed on the rotating frame in order to be able to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 maybe under repository rest of the structure 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.320
 this plant uses stainless steel because it resists well to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.880
 corrosion 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.789
 transport companies must run their buses continuously during 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:01.750
 years 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.630
 - rust that meant less costly repairs that make you lose 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 time 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.370
 we now move the whole structure to another part of the 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:21.529
 factory coulon sprays a black anti-abrasion layer on the jump at citi and 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.579
 the lower part of the bus 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.889
 it protects against noise and damage caused by pebbles other 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 defect and that can be found on the road 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.949
 when you apply then once the very resistant on the front floor 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.229
 to lay a sou floor that is son to strengthen the tower 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.319
 the bus then turned around to install four air tanks 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.319
 tablet under the roof 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.149
 three of these tanks are intended for brake systems the fourth 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.359
 for doors and other mechanisms 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.519
 melamine panels constituting the ceiling hides all this 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.379
 the engine radiator is located at the back of the bus 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.200
 we turn the bus over and lay down vinyl flooring 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.619
 water resistant 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.619
 specially created to support intensive use 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.799
 sides and weight are covered with fiberglass panels 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.769
 to prevent corrosion of the flow of glue rather than defects or 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.489
 inheritance 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 then we fix the front of the fiberglass bus for axa 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.339
 the low-emission diesel engine of the bus competed already assembled 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.339
 to connect it to the transmission and the drive shaft in the 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.709
 engine compartment 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.419
 editing no air conditioning features sliding windows that can 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.349
 open up 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.819
 in the air-conditioned buses only the upper part of the windows open 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.279
 molded fiberglass seat upholstery is a material that 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.849
 looks from afar and that is woven on a big canvas then stuck on a 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.419
 inlay fiberglass 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.009
 this system helps prevent vandals from slashing seats with their 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.009
 knives 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.359
 to then install the driver's seat the wheels and all the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.180
 controls among which are the switch activates the floor 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.359
 low 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.359
 this list also includes a pension for wheelchairs 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.610
 a safety system block the accelerator pedal it operates the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.699
 brake to prevent the purpose of butchering when the rent for the floors 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 lowers are used 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.979
 the bus ended underwent more than two million tests of applications 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.090
 with all systems running this allows to check there is no 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.090
 flight 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.189
 at each production phase perform a quality control and 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.709
 invigorating all the mechanical safety to finishes going through 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.579
 the smallest details
