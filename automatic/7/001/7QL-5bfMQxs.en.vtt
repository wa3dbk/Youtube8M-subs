slack in the chain is good and if it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.180 
slack in the chain is good and if it
isn't<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.840> replace<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:12.770> kind<00:02:13.100> of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
isn't if I replace it what kind of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.680 
isn't if I replace it what kind of
tension<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.820> need<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.300> mean<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.660> just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
tension do I need I mean I'm just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.690 
tension do I need I mean I'm just
looking<00:02:15.140> at<00:02:15.260> quarter-inch<00:02:15.890> deflection

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
looking at quarter-inch deflection

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.990 
looking at quarter-inch deflection
aren't<00:02:17.740> going<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.040> them<00:02:19.250> tight<00:02:19.520> oh<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.910> a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
aren't going to have them tight oh you a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.820 
aren't going to have them tight oh you a
little<00:02:20.210> bit<00:02:20.300> tighter<00:02:20.510> than<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.870> er<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.230> little

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
little bit tighter than that er a little

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.370 
little bit tighter than that er a little
bit<00:02:21.920> looser<00:02:22.220> than<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.730> still<00:02:22.970> want<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
bit looser than that you still want to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.560 
bit looser than that you still want to
have<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.530> over<00:02:24.620> tightened<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.450> see

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
have it over tightened but you can see

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.220 
have it over tightened but you can see
how<00:02:26.660> much<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:28.670> thing<00:02:28.970> turns<00:02:29.270> before<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.870> gets

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
how much this thing turns before it gets

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
how much this thing turns before it gets
tension<00:02:30.710> on<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.830> chain<00:02:33.580> same<00:02:34.580> thing<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:34.850> this

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
tension on that chain same thing on this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.750 
tension on that chain same thing on this
side

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.100 

so<00:02:43.760> anyway<00:02:44.030> leave<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> comment<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.080> know
