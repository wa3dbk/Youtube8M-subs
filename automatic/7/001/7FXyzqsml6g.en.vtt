00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
I think the biggest thing is if you're

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.980 
I think the biggest thing is if you're
not<00:03:19.550> sure<00:03:19.730> if<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.970> want<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.210> do<00:03:20.360> or<00:03:20.540> just<00:03:20.720> try
