00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
not just from the same collection

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.170 
not just from the same collection
anymore<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.760> watching<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> video

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
anymore I was just watching the video

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
anymore I was just watching the video
before<00:00:27.480> they're<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
before they're like it's just not the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.980 
before they're like it's just not the
same<00:00:29.699> collection<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.630> any

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
same collection but it's just any

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
same collection but it's just any
condition<00:00:31.560> now<00:00:32.090> I'm<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.239> too<00:00:33.390> sure<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
condition now I'm not too sure how it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.760 
condition now I'm not too sure how it
works<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.430> makes<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.770> there's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
works but it just makes you know there's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.709 
works but it just makes you know there's
more<00:00:37.980> options<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.820> different<00:00:39.059> cunning<00:00:39.480> mo

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
more options to get different cunning mo

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.490 
more options to get different cunning mo
so<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.579> was<00:00:41.579> thinking<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.059> make<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> video

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
so like I was thinking just make a video

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.270 
so like I was thinking just make a video
see<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.920> get

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
see what I can get

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
see what I can get
I<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.610> looking<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.059> famous<00:00:45.360> sergeants

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I was looking at these famous sergeants

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.310 
I was looking at these famous sergeants
I<00:00:47.210> could<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> red<00:00:48.899> line

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I could get a red line

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
I could get a red line
make<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.680> red<00:00:49.860> line<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.360> be

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
make a red line and that would be

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
make a red line and that would be
fucking<00:00:51.629> awesome<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.739> again<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.010> could

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
fucking awesome but then again I could

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
fucking awesome but then again I could
get<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> p90<00:00:53.610> try<00:00:53.789> again<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.090> no<00:00:54.329> vant<00:00:54.600> account

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
get a p90 try again or no vant account

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
get a p90 try again or no vant account
worth<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.379> much<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.270> way<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
worth as much but I think the way it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
worth as much but I think the way it
works<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.600> gun<00:01:01.370> from<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
works is you put on one gun from that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
works is you put on one gun from that
collection<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:04.110> gives<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
collection and that gives you a like a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
collection and that gives you a like a
10%<00:01:04.979> chance<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> collection<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.390> get

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
10% chance from that collection to get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
10% chance from that collection to get
it<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.189> let's<00:01:08.189> say<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.180> these

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it so let's say these are all these

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.510 
it so let's say these are all these
pistols<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.049> from<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.720> csgo<00:01:12.740> histories<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
pistols are from the csgo histories so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.630 
pistols are from the csgo histories so
for<00:01:15.150> fourth<00:01:15.450> season<00:01:16.820> they<00:01:19.009> put<00:01:20.009> someone<00:01:20.250> from

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
for fourth season they put someone from

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020 
for fourth season they put someone from
there<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.570> collection<00:01:22.310> yeah<00:01:23.310> yeah<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
there that collection yeah yeah it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
there that collection yeah yeah it's
like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> 50%<00:01:24.689> chance<00:01:25.080> someone<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.950> next

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
like a 50% chance someone to get next

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.600 
like a 50% chance someone to get next
one<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> CZ<00:01:28.490> teacher<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:31.100> p250<00:01:32.100> antidote

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
one up so a CZ teacher or p250 antidote

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
one up so a CZ teacher or p250 antidote
so<00:01:34.189> what<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.310> thinking<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.180> should<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
so what I'm thinking is I should try and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.120 
so what I'm thinking is I should try and
rescue<00:01:38.509> these<00:01:39.509> three<00:01:39.869> four<00:01:40.049> masses<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
rescue these three four masses so it's a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.850 
rescue these three four masses so it's a
30%<00:01:41.790> chance

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
30% chance

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
30% chance
and<00:01:44.580> then<00:01:46.790> I'm<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:48.000> even<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.240> enough

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and then I'm not gonna even have enough

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.940 
and then I'm not gonna even have enough
I<00:01:48.840> am<00:01:49.740> Oh
