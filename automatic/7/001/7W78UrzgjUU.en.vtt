00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 good afternoon glad to welcome you on 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.730
 The designer's toy channel is 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.179
 another review of such a constructor 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.429
 the knights of the castles there is something like that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 he doesnâ€™t know any boat there 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.650
 not pirates this but something such some 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.900
 there are comrades who attack the knight 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.660
 Castle 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.990
 so the league company also had knights 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.239
 but I think they stopped the series 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.910
 about knights and now everyone has to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.489
 lovers 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.460
 knights buy designers 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.960
 bric bric designers 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.469
 naturally filled this niche but bric 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 honestly say very good too 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 quality designer in at least 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.859
 I like how they make their parts 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 and their sets 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:08.189
 so well let's get down let's open ah here 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 this set and what do we have inside by the way 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.710
 on the reverse side I will consider the lock 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 a little bit different a little bit different 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.790
 built side color towers and knights 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 upstairs and over there people even eat there 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.040
 something else well, sex is a little country 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.439
 everything is different but interesting too 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 it will be possible to do a variety of 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.380
 options and so what 's inside inside y 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 us a bunch of packages in one package and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 a little instruction so well sachets we 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.900
 open the magic knife 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.610
 yes you need a good enough sharp 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 by the way the knife in children is not a toy therefore in 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.040
 this state of my not always keep 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.570
 so here we remove the legs removed 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.360
 look further so it means from one 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 the package came out three packages well, just some kind 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 Matryoshka these bags as far as I know 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.370
 very good hands open this one 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.820
 again you need to open the package magically 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.820
 knife 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.530
 Well, proceed to the quick assembly and so 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.170
 what we did we did 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.690
 ship 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.870
 But with such incomprehensible flags and summer 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.870
 sail or flags something like that 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 two passengers in this ship which 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.769
 like war they want to rescue their 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 comrade who languished in the dungeon herself 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:05.590
 tower with windows on which there are bars 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:15.120
 the archer who guards this tower but here 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:17.739
 here we have such type of torches such burn here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.610
 by the way in the set there were a few spare 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.720
 parts here is such a helmet here is such 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.280
 detail spare gold key and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.519
 spare pen 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.760
 Well, it's like a trifle that is very 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.850
 enjoyable also glad that here here 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.440
 just put weed that too 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.440
 very useful somewhere 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.200
 general impression of the set of course 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.290
 good overall impression is very good 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.019
 bad little impression about the hands 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.300
 Here are these minifigures, they are a little bit 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.240
 fly out don't really want to hold on 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.400
 but in another sense just fnaf all 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.960
 Wonderful, that is to say 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.950
 saying interesting ship two oars 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:12.290
 whole flocks of itself lattice tower window 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.000
 and here it is the door that can 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.690
 use somewhere and in lego police 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.240
 come here to make a prison and that's such 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.040
 the door will turn out that is too 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.100
 use the same lattices too 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.100
 can be used if you suddenly 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.470
 are going to play some kind of there 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.510
 chase the police jail well and something in this 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.060
 the spirit but the pen as you see here they are 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.070

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.980
 Well, as it is not very well, you can 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.430
 probably try using with 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.510
 with other hands and then they will be mine 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:05.450
