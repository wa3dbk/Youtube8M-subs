00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.319
 Psalm 91 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.980
 the one who lives in the shelter of the highest 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.700
 will dwell under the shadow of the omnipotent 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 I will say to jehovah my hope and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:22.020
 my fortress : my God in whom to trust and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 he will free you from the hunter's tie of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.170
 destructive pest with its feathers that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 will cover and under your wings you will be 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 sure shield and lengthens is your truth not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 you will fear the night terror or the arrow 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 that flies by day , nor the pestilence that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.040
 walk in darkness or to death that in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 half of the day destroy 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.630
 will fall by your side one thousand and ten thousand to your 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.300
 right you will certainly not get 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.000
 with your eyes you will look and see the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 reward of the wicked because you've 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.600
 put to jehovÃ¡ that is my hope to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.680
 Soaring over your room, do not overdo 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.170
 will come evil or plague will touch your home 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.890
 for his angels will command about you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.259
 that they keep you in all your ways in 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 your hands will take you to your skin or 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.320
 stumble in stone over the lion and in 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.550
 the footsteps today you will make the puppy of 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 lion and the dragon 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.270
 because in my position his love I 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 so I save I'll put up by 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 how much you have known my name will invoke me 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.150
 and I will respond with him I will be in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.330
 the anguish I will free him and glorify him 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.000
 I will satisfy you with long life and I will show you 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.620
 my salvation 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.620
