00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
printed object obviously and the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.610 
printed object obviously and the
hydrographic<00:00:08.910> film<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.809> activator<00:00:10.230> spray

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
hydrographic film and activator spray

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.660 
hydrographic film and activator spray
also<00:00:11.550> either<00:00:11.820> some<00:00:12.179> scissors<00:00:12.570> or<00:00:12.900> knife

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670

masking tape rubber gloves and double

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.400 
masking tape rubber gloves and double
sided<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> lay<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
sided so the first thing is lay out the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.279 
sided so the first thing is lay out the
film<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.090> put<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.210> object<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.750> top<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
film and put your object on top of it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.480 
film and put your object on top of it
and<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> cut<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> little

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
and we're going to cut out a little

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.730 
and we're going to cut out a little
square<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> film<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.289> big<00:00:28.560> enough

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
square of the film that's a big enough

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.060 
square of the film that's a big enough
to<00:00:28.949> cover<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> whole<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.980> think<00:00:31.980> about

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to cover the whole thing so think about

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.979 
to cover the whole thing so think about
how<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> wrap<00:00:32.969> around<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.450> object

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.450 

try<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> imagine<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> Christmas

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
try to imagine it's like a Christmas

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.459 
try to imagine it's like a Christmas
present<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.629> cover<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
present and it has to cover all the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.490 
present and it has to cover all the
sides<00:00:41.540> then<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> take<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.320> blue

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
sides then we're going to take some blue

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.069 
sides then we're going to take some blue
tape<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.180> put<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> edges<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> film

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.950 

and<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.180> hold<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.480> film<00:00:56.750> out

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
and this is just to hold the film out

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.540 
and this is just to hold the film out
flat<00:00:57.350> while<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:57.800> floating<00:00:58.160> in<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.340> water

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
flat while it's floating in the water

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.700 
flat while it's floating in the water
and<00:00:58.910> keep<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.450> from<00:00:59.720> wrinkling<00:00:59.960> up<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:05.710> you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and keep it from wrinkling up and you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.840 
and keep it from wrinkling up and you
can<00:01:06.890> cut<00:01:07.070> off<00:01:07.190> any<00:01:07.460> excess<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:08.150> there<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.540> any

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.550 

so<00:01:16.850> when<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.330> lay<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.540> film<00:01:17.869> in<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.080> water<00:01:18.259> I

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
so when you lay the film in the water I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.770 
so when you lay the film in the water I
want<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.860> start<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.340> one<00:01:19.580> edge<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.090> then

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
want to start with one edge and then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.930 
want to start with one edge and then
gradually<00:01:21.380> lay<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.430> rest<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.909> so

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
gradually lay down the rest of it so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.639 
gradually lay down the rest of it so
that<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.360> don't<00:01:23.630> get<00:01:23.750> any<00:01:23.930> air<00:01:24.259> bubbles

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
that you don't get any air bubbles

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.410 
that you don't get any air bubbles
underneath<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:28.460> should<00:01:28.670> see<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.090> films

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
underneath you should see the films

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.870 
underneath you should see the films
start<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.930> stretch<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.830> contract<00:01:30.979> after<00:01:31.580> a

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
start to stretch and contract after a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.410 
start to stretch and contract after a
few<00:01:32.090> seconds<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.399> doesn't<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.000> means<00:01:35.270> you

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
few seconds if it doesn't it means you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.680 
few seconds if it doesn't it means you
probably<00:01:35.600> put<00:01:36.110> down<00:01:36.320> alongside<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:37.570> let<00:01:38.570> it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
probably put down alongside you let it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.320 
probably put down alongside you let it
sit<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.229> soak<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:39.890> water<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:40.610> about<00:01:40.820> 60

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
sit there and soak up water for about 60

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.940 
sit there and soak up water for about 60
seconds<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.080> then<00:01:42.289> we'll<00:01:42.470> spray<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
seconds and then we'll spray the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.820 
seconds and then we'll spray the
applicator<00:01:43.429> on<00:01:44.050> be<00:01:45.050> sure<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.380> check<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
applicator on be sure to check the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.590 
applicator on be sure to check the
bottom<00:01:45.979> level<00:01:46.310> before<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.970> spray<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.360> just

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
bottom level before you spray it just

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.940 
bottom level before you spray it just
like<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.880> spray<00:01:50.270> paint<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:51.350> spray<00:01:51.800> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
like a can of spray paint now spray the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.880 
like a can of spray paint now spray the
applicator<00:01:52.929> liberally<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.289> wide<00:01:54.560> even

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
applicator liberally and wide even

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.010 
applicator liberally and wide even
strokes<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.759> be<00:01:56.149> sure<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.360> do<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
strokes and be sure to do this in a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.779 
strokes and be sure to do this in a
well-ventilated<00:01:57.229> area<00:01:58.099> as<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.459> don't<00:01:58.640> want

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
well-ventilated area as you don't want

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.219 
well-ventilated area as you don't want
to<00:01:58.849> feel<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.209> you<00:02:00.280> dip<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.429> object<00:02:01.819> in<00:02:02.170> try<00:02:03.170> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
to feel it you dip the object in try to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.130 
to feel it you dip the object in try to
go<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:03.649> at<00:02:03.830> an<00:02:03.979> angle<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.910> flat<00:02:05.569> surfaces

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
go in at an angle because flat surfaces

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.440 
go in at an angle because flat surfaces
will<00:02:06.410> tend<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.709> get<00:02:06.910> air<00:02:07.910> bubbles<00:02:08.300> underneath

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
will tend to get air bubbles underneath

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.260 
will tend to get air bubbles underneath
them<00:02:09.280> push<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.489> all<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.640> way<00:02:10.789> through<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
them push it all the way through the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.330 
them push it all the way through the
film<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.550> then<00:02:13.550> shake<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.950> shake<00:02:15.950> off<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
film and then shake it to shake off the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.900 
film and then shake it to shake off the
excess<00:02:16.370> film<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.620> turn<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.220> around<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.700> bring

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
excess film and turn it around and bring

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.380 
excess film and turn it around and bring
it<00:02:20.030> back<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.209> through<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.690> water<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:22.390> you're

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it back up through the water and you're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.360 
it back up through the water and you're
done

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
done

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.180 
done
so<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.430> want<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> let<00:02:25.879> it<00:02:26.030> dry<00:02:26.270> for<00:02:26.300> about<00:02:27.190> two

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
so you want to let it dry for about two

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.479 
so you want to let it dry for about two
or<00:02:28.340> three<00:02:28.370> hours<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:30.470> handling<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:34.310> sure
