this<00:00:14.009> wave<00:00:14.340> pattern<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.089> achieved<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:16.020> by

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
this wave pattern was achieved just by

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
this wave pattern was achieved just by
stitching<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.730> waves<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.449> see<00:00:18.690> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
stitching the waves that you see and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
stitching the waves that you see and
gathering<00:00:19.470> them<00:00:19.619> together

the only stitch that you'll need to use
is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> running<00:00:23.010> stitch<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> pretty

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
going to show you how I did it using a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.330 
going to show you how I did it using a
needle<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.750> strong<00:00:31.080> thread<00:00:34.340> you're

needle and really strong thread you're

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.470 
needle and really strong thread you're
going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> start<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> running<00:00:38.700> stitch

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
going to start the running stitch

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
going to start the running stitch
following<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> shape<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.219> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> do

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I did waves you could do circles flowers

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290 
I did waves you could do circles flowers
are<00:00:46.140> shapes<00:00:46.620> whatever<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.399> want<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.030> trick

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
stitches pretty small and you want to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
stitches pretty small and you want to
have<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.980> strong<00:00:53.010> threads<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.210> when

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
have really strong threads so when

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
have really strong threads so when
you're<00:00:54.629> gathering<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.770> gather<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you're gathering it you can gather it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.959 
you're gathering it you can gather it
pretty<00:00:56.550> tightly<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.809> I'm<00:00:58.170> making<00:00:58.710> my<00:00:59.100> running

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
pretty tightly so I'm making my running

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.270 
pretty tightly so I'm making my running
stitch

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.340 

so<00:01:08.280> I've<00:01:08.400> stitched<00:01:08.640> most<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> wave<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.930> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so I've stitched most of the wave I just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.820 
so I've stitched most of the wave I just
have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> couple<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> stitches<00:01:11.330> left<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
have a couple of stitches left and I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
have a couple of stitches left and I
know<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.730> this<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.120> be<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.660> pretty

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
know that this can be a pretty

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
know that this can be a pretty
time-consuming<00:01:16.760> technique<00:01:17.760> but<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> results

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
time-consuming technique but the results

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.930 
time-consuming technique but the results
are<00:01:18.750> totally<00:01:19.040> rewarded<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.580> really

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
are totally rewarded so I really

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.420 
are totally rewarded so I really
encourage<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.480> give<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.870> a<00:01:22.080> try<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:25.430> this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
encourage you to give you a try and this

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.650 
encourage you to give you a try and this
is<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:26.730> it<00:01:26.910> should<00:01:27.150> look

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
is how it should look

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.330 
is how it should look
before<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.410> gathering<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.010> can<00:01:29.160> see

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
before you start gathering you can see

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
before you start gathering you can see
that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> did<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.480> gathering

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that I did a little bit of gathering

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
that I did a little bit of gathering
already<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:31.980> it<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.400> plain<00:01:32.760> running<00:01:33.300> stitch

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
already but it just plain running stitch

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.650 
already but it just plain running stitch
and<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> part<00:01:35.370> now<00:01:35.670> where<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
and this is the part now where you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.350 
and this is the part now where you
really<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:38.160> thankful<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.060> chosen

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
really will be thankful if you chosen

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.320 
really will be thankful if you chosen
really<00:01:40.200> strong<00:01:40.530> thread<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
really strong thread because you want to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.110 
really strong thread because you want to
start<00:01:42.600> gathering<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.650> your<00:01:44.340> stitches<00:01:44.820> like

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
start gathering all your stitches like

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.430 
start gathering all your stitches like
making<00:01:45.570> pleats<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:46.200> tight<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.370> possible<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
making pleats as tight as possible and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.140 
making pleats as tight as possible and
the<00:01:49.440> pattern<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.010> only<00:01:50.280> appear<00:01:50.910> if<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
the pattern will only appear if you

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.719 
the pattern will only appear if you
actually<00:01:51.510> make<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.380> tight<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.100> really

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
actually make it pretty tight so really

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.230 
actually make it pretty tight so really
go<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.330> strong<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.620> possible<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.150> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
go as strong as possible here and you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.990 
go as strong as possible here and you
see<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.510> I'm<00:01:57.750> making<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.680> puff

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
see that I'm making this little puff

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.460 
see that I'm making this little puff
pleat<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.150> here<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.200> look

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
pleat in here and this is what you look

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.590 
pleat in here and this is what you look
like<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.370> had<00:02:02.490> done<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> same<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
like and if I had done the same thing in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800 
like and if I had done the same thing in
all<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.080> my<00:02:04.290> waves<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.369> fabric<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
all of my waves here in the fabric you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
all of my waves here in the fabric you
would<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.440> gather<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.459> different

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
would just see it gather it in different

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
would just see it gather it in different
places<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.350> after<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.770> gather<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> also

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
places so after you gather it you also

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.970 
places so after you gather it you also
want<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> tie<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.300> pretty<00:02:12.720> hard<00:02:13.020> because<00:02:13.350> once

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
want to tie it pretty hard because once

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
want to tie it pretty hard because once
you<00:02:14.130> put<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> dye<00:02:14.880> bath<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.660> gathering

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you put it in the dye bath the gathering

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
you put it in the dye bath the gathering
will<00:02:16.260> likely<00:02:17.090> come<00:02:18.090> undone<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.890> time

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
will likely come undone and at this time

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.520 
will likely come undone and at this time
we<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:20.610> need<00:02:20.790> any<00:02:21.000> needle<00:02:21.540> yet<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.320> is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
we don't need any needle yet and this is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
we don't need any needle yet and this is
really<00:02:22.680> strong<00:02:23.040> tread<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.200> what<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
really strong tread and this is what it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
really strong tread and this is what it
will<00:02:25.590> look<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.860> before<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.730> put<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
will look like before you put it in the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
will look like before you put it in the
dye<00:02:27.510> bath<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.410> little<00:02:28.650> puffs<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.190> you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
dye bath just these little puffs and you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.979 
dye bath just these little puffs and you
see<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.550> from<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.790> other<00:02:29.910> side<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.720> all

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
see it from the other side you have all

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.979 
see it from the other side you have all
these<00:02:31.230> gatherings<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:32.420> every<00:02:33.420> little<00:02:33.750> pleat

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
these gatherings here every little pleat

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.540 
these gatherings here every little pleat
that<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.320> formed<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.980> stitch<00:02:35.190> will

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that you formed with the stitch will

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.860 
that you formed with the stitch will
create<00:02:37.489> these<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.760> dots<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.630> see

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
create these little dots that you see

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.440 
create these little dots that you see
and<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.290> what<00:02:40.470> will<00:02:40.620> create<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:41.130> pattern

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
and that's what will create your pattern

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.729 
and that's what will create your pattern
you<00:02:42.450> should<00:02:42.480> play<00:02:42.900> around<00:02:43.050> with<00:02:43.380> different

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
you should play around with different

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.860 
you should play around with different
thicknesses<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.370> threads<00:02:44.730> also<00:02:45.720> with

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
thicknesses of threads also with

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.890 
thicknesses of threads also with
different<00:02:45.989> shapes<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.360> make<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.630> swatches

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
different shapes and make some swatches

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.479 
different shapes and make some swatches
in<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.410> beginning<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.040> sometimes<00:02:50.400> a

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
in the beginning it's sometimes a

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.220 
in the beginning it's sometimes a
frustrating<00:02:51.030> technique<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.959> spend

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
frustrating technique because you spend

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.930 
frustrating technique because you spend
all<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.410> time<00:02:52.800> doing<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.250> teaching<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
all that time doing this teaching and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.150 
all that time doing this teaching and
after<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> dyeing<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> lot<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
after you do the dyeing not a lot of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.880 
after you do the dyeing not a lot of
results<00:02:56.640> appear<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.410> guarantee<00:02:58.769> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
results appear but I can guarantee you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.820 
results appear but I can guarantee you
that<00:02:58.920> you'll<00:02:59.340> get<00:02:59.640> better<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.480> go<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.320> one

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
that you'll get better as you go and one

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.259 
that you'll get better as you go and one
day<00:03:02.010> you'll<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> able<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.760> something<00:03:03.120> like

day you'll be able to do something like

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.990 
day you'll be able to do something like
this<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.250> how<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.640> stitch

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
this and this is how you do stitch

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.709 
this and this is how you do stitch
resisting<00:03:06.709> tie-dye
