00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
we have the beet harvester to match same

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
we have the beet harvester to match same
thing<00:00:30.480> basically<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> same<00:00:32.070> basically

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
thing basically it is the same basically

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
thing basically it is the same basically
different<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> same<00:00:34.140> machines

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
different these are the same machines

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.139 
different these are the same machines
that<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.219> game<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.700> cheaper

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that are in the game so it's cheaper

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.209 
that are in the game so it's cheaper
yeah<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.380> tripled<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> head<00:00:37.980> basically

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
yeah but they tripled the head basically

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
yeah but they tripled the head basically
yeah<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:38.969> much<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:40.050> here's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
yeah pretty much so here you go here's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.950 
yeah pretty much so here you go here's
the<00:00:40.350> potato<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.070> yep<00:00:41.540> well<00:00:42.540> again<00:00:42.809> they

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the potato one yep well again they

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.060 
the potato one yep well again they
didn't<00:00:43.170> list<00:00:43.290> capacity<00:00:43.739> which<00:00:43.860> annoys<00:00:44.040> me

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
didn't list capacity which annoys me

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.010 
didn't list capacity which annoys me
yeah<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> head<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
yeah so as you can see the head is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
yeah so as you can see the head is
massive<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.800> probably<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.579> realistic

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
massive it's probably not very realistic

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
massive it's probably not very realistic
