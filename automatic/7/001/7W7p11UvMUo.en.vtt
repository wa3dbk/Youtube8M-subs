00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.650
 it seems a lot to that recently but yes that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.779
 it's different it's totally different 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.029
 it is as worst done we could say to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.439
 see I do not say maybe worse but it will not be 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 another one that was more geometric and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.640
 this one is a little weirder we're going to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 leave it and weird or we will not call the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.370
 I was 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.690

 We raise to catch point exactly 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.860
 but it comes a little closer I did not come very 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.600
 well because we're going to catch the slipstream and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.600

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.850
 we can try pushing towards 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.860
 in front of that is that we do not catch him missing

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.970
 iron and brake but it happened to me

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.930
 according to the law of proportion motive 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.490
 to not give it a shot to see if we get 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.910
