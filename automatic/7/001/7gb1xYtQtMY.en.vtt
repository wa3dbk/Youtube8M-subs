 inserted in another photo in the bush 23 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.949
 let's understand here how we can insert photos and change them 20 from dpt 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.340
 now the wish that there is no book 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.790
 called 180 fletch ex-model portraits 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.790
 it's too big 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 very well I will choose again the layout to be classic 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.820
 I will introduce my pastor and strong folder to Argentina already selected 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 we can choose any folder inside our computer 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.540
 advanced options 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.070
 I can choose between 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 omã or mas fotospor page up to 24 fotospor party I can not choose eu 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.850
 I think this is a messenger because his stock dropped a lot he had in his hands 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.010
 I recommend 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.050
 the truth of a strong at-4 at most per page but is at your discretion 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.070
 the well select a specific number of pages 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.220
 here will give pages with about two photos per page 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.980
 we will listen to the photos by the file name 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.540
 I am more option file name because if you can control until 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.920
 even for windows that name in the register of your photos 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.159
 but we still lack as continuous as I do not know if you like 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.460
 feel free 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.620
 is the automatic correction 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.640
 this is very interesting if you have not done any kind of treatment in the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.920
 your photo 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 Let's compare before and after so you have an idea. 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.300
 the creations in our book's layouts our book is already created 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.910
 Let's change one of the photos. 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.420
 let's choose 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 page 6 this photograph taken per liter we will not choose another one 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.470
 here this page page of maradona ti we will eliminate the one from here we will leave your 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.390
 focus fans 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 very well 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.330
 in tietê there are many options that we can do within bush with the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.300
 our photos change itself 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 first I want to change this photo in different ways 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 every time you want a photo for several options 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 type of vote in the photo 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.259
 you can 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.589
 with the red arrow inside reduce the photo as if it were a cut 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.149
 the bodies do not want 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:25.549
 tici ladinho appears coutinho will be alone she 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.479
 for now it's looking more so you can select photo 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.819
 north is a new photo 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.789
 and they are option of editing of the entrudo of points 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.370
 The mother supposing I want to leave this photo regatinha can not do this 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.449
 time 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:45.479
 here in my not the right tools there is voting is the first time 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.769
 we are using, can void the vote 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.910
 I can also cause here to rotate 90 degrees left or right 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.779
 perfectly 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.259
 Let's cancel the vote. 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.129
 another situation that we can 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.979
 edit our photos is through transparency 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.169
 know those photos style watermark kaka is what we can do north 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.149
 How beautiful is it? 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.779
 we can make our photo almost completely transparent 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.319
 This looks great when you put it on. 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.660
 the option as the bottom of the ship pasture you want the right mouse button 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.589
 I set photo as background 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.149
 it's very good 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.849
 I can leave this picture up here for example. 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.999
 Let's continue working with your photograph here. 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.569
 I do not want transparency 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.049
 and I want to take things off 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.459
 martitegi leaves you connection option tomatoe enabled to retire let's see 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.629
 if there is any difference 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.219
 maybe you lost a bit of advance because that photo she 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.129
 is already with 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.150
 a very reasonable clarity to complicate again 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.049
 good has not changed much but I can assure you that there are 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.819
 they make quite different 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.669
 Let's see this one from here for examples. 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.629
 with this photo that got a little darker 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.729
 see 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.189
 the correction by the military a lack a little clearer clearer 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.799
 I do not even want this photograph that will click on a delete 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.729
 Let's work with this photo. 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.320
 I do not want this photo to be a background photo so I'll clean the background 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.270
 an operation that was his photograph 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.610
 Let's see the options we have 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.270
 we can change all things to forks 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.749
 we can leave the photo colored as it is already black and white 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.749
 sector has a photo of your life 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.610
 the ford the black and white it can still be treated with regard to April 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.039
 only in cities of curvelo that can be evaluated 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.300
 Look, just because I'm changing the river. 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 in the last picture that is happening 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.589
 this is interesting when you have a photograph especially in black and 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.620
 white that it is too dark 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.189
 for example if my photo was like this 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.129
 The sea is very sincere. 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.419
 we can change the color by changing river 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.779
 in the kind of treatment we can do 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.960
 the photo becomes brighter it looks more beautiful 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.310
 we can do this for the pattern repeats the chulos pattern 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.679
 so you have to have unable to adjust with photos inside 

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:22.550
 few 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.650
 we can 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.710
 move the position of each of them 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.779
 here a centralized position we can 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.339
 leave it as a double page we've been in another video 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.939
 I do not want double page anymore 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.909
 we can change the size of it set as background fill the page 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:47.199
 and we can create layers that would layer the bed of your vacancy 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.139
 When you have another photo? 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.169
 How do you say it works? I'll take the bottom. 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.379
 assuming I have another picture of you 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.930
 I want this photo of the term 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.370
 I stayed on top of this photograph assuming that this is a background photo 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.469
 because 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.689
 Very well, she's upstairs already. 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.559
 if it were not it would be in a lower layer in the optic almada send 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.889
 back 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.129
 this official photo 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.249
 I'm going to go back 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:21.039
 the truth 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.759
 tito just made plate kissed marassa photo as background then 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.879
 this my photo she can not be inserted behind the background because 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.610
 I already have a background 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.069
 if I did not have the power to the bottom I could insert that photo back 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.249
 voted 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.240
 I can put one photograph on top of the other and also by exchanging 

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.379
 position 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.379
 that automatically this photo is underneath the photo that I wanted 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.789
 are unable to be photo editing inside everything that 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.130
 you can make all your black and white photos look more beautiful according to 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.999
 with your desire 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.080
 seventy 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.270
 We could take this photo. 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.419
 let the computer saturation 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.469
 We can change things here. 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:14.039
 only this is not so good, huh? 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.379
 simply click on the color again to return to normal a photo 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.379
 well-saturated public 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.519
 we made several photo changes inside pt
