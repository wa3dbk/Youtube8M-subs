00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
partially and then go into the Burrow
and<00:01:19.229> spit<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.560> part<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> their<00:01:20.070> meal<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> share

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it with the chick sounds kind of gross

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.640 
it with the chick sounds kind of gross
but<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.590> works<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.250> birds<00:01:24.650> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
but that works pretty well for birds the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.630 
but that works pretty well for birds the
Penguins<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.520> are

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
Penguins that we have here are

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
Penguins that we have here are
Magellanic<00:01:27.240> penguins<00:01:27.630> they're<00:01:27.869> found<00:01:28.049> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
Magellanic penguins they're found in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
Magellanic penguins they're found in
South<00:01:28.470> America<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.009> live<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> way

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
South America they live all the way

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.270 
South America they live all the way
along<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> coast<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.360> Argentina<00:01:31.130> parts<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
along the coast of Argentina parts of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.149 
along the coast of Argentina parts of
Brazil<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.150> Chile<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:34.500> seems<00:01:34.829> kind<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> weird

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
Brazil and Chile it seems kind of weird

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
Brazil and Chile it seems kind of weird
to<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.640> penguins<00:01:36.090> live<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.509> San

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to think that penguins live here in San

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
to think that penguins live here in San
Francisco<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.200> seems<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> might<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.950> too

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
Francisco it seems like it might be too

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
Francisco it seems like it might be too
warm<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> climate<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> South

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
warm for them but the climate in South

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
warm for them but the climate in South
America<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> different

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
America is really not that different

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
America is really not that different
from<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> climate<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.750> while<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> seems

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
from the climate here so while it seems

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.389 
from the climate here so while it seems
a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.380> odd<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> penguins<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.280> live

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a little odd that penguins would live

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
a little odd that penguins would live
here<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.729> Bay<00:01:44.850> Area<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.570> climate<00:01:45.899> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here in the Bay Area the climate is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.999 
here in the Bay Area the climate is
pretty<00:01:46.140> similar<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:46.890> would

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pretty similar to what they would

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
pretty similar to what they would
experience<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> wild<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.540> actually

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
experience in the wild and we actually

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
experience in the wild and we actually
have<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.259> most<00:01:49.619> productive<00:01:49.920> colony<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
have the most productive colony of
