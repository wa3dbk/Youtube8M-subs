as a couple of the failures because you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.170 
as a couple of the failures because you
know<00:00:38.160> sometimes<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.850> nice<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:40.040> see<00:00:41.180> work

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
know sometimes it's nice to see work

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440 
know sometimes it's nice to see work
which<00:00:42.510> hasn't<00:00:42.989> turned<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.620> good<00:00:44.360> but<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
which hasn't turned out so good but in

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.430 
which hasn't turned out so good but in
saying<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> hasn't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
saying that it's not that it hasn't

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.130 
saying that it's not that it hasn't
turned<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.420> guess<00:00:48.930> they're

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
turned out good because I guess they're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.799 
turned out good because I guess they're
not<00:00:49.230> finished<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.510> yeah<00:00:51.510> i'm<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
not finished but yeah i'm going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.680 
not finished but yeah i'm going to
rework<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.320> again<00:00:52.590> until<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:53.670> work<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
rework them again until they work and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
rework them again until they work and
that's<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.960> good<00:00:55.079> thing<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.379> painting<00:00:56.309> good

the<00:01:42.119> disasters<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.110> saying<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.880> was

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the disasters I'm just saying that I was

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.460 
the disasters I'm just saying that I was
just<00:01:45.030> working<00:01:45.240> through<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.780> ideas<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> my

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
just working through some ideas in my

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.960 
just working through some ideas in my
head<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> became<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.549> busy<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
head and it just became a bit busy and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.770 
head and it just became a bit busy and
I've<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.090> been<00:01:54.390> layering<00:01:55.040> image<00:01:56.040> over<00:01:56.340> image

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
I've just been layering image over image

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
I've just been layering image over image
rubbing<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.049> next<00:01:58.500> layer<00:01:58.829> bitumen<00:01:59.579> next

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
rubbing it out next layer bitumen next

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
rubbing it out next layer bitumen next
layer<00:02:00.240> rubbing<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.250> it's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
layer rubbing it back but I think it's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.649 
layer rubbing it back but I think it's
just<00:02:02.430> gotten<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> stage<00:02:03.149> where<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
just gotten to the stage where it's a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.959 
just gotten to the stage where it's a
bit<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:03.990> busy<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.189> goes<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.790> one

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
bit too busy and that goes for this one

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.160 
bit too busy and that goes for this one
down<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.479> well<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> another

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
down here as well this is another

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
down here as well this is another
completely<00:02:07.740> separate<00:02:08.099> painting<00:02:08.429> I'll<00:02:08.580> just

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
completely separate painting I'll just

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.130 
completely separate painting I'll just
move<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.330> road<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.989> see

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
move it out of the road so you can see

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.850 
move it out of the road so you can see
the<00:02:10.259> difference

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.910 

but<00:02:14.860> once<00:02:15.070> again<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:15.670> me<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:18.190> just<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:19.920> don't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
but once again for me it's just I don't

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.100 
but once again for me it's just I don't
know<00:02:21.070> for<00:02:21.580> me<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.790> doesn't<00:02:22.180> work<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.690> love

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
know for me it just doesn't work I love

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.680 
know for me it just doesn't work I love
the<00:02:23.230> textures<00:02:23.710> great<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:25.300> they're<00:02:25.480> for
