00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.609
 hello kids 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.570
 welcome to one more verse from 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.690
 zoeira 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.270
 let's go straight to 30 minecraft versus 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.450
 The theory is obvious that you know 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.540
 minecraft the kiko dream game where 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.539
 There is a square ball but I doubt it. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.060
 much you know theory is a game 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.449
 full of lyrics that tried to copy several 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.680
 good games and even then it sucked 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.860
 kaká let the same square facts 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.470
 it is still 3d is 2 copy of sea with 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.930
 brain cancer has an infinite world 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 and it only has an end down because 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.910
 developers just wanted to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.970
 left to right copying Mario from 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.850
 new has various difficulties and styles 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.520
 have different difficulties. 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.430
 fucking green and fucking fanboy that already 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.730
 It's coming a lot on twitter already sold 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.119
 60 million copies and continues to sell 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.459
 only sold 1.2 million has almost no bugs 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.429
 you will hardly find any 

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.319
 there are pieces of land that have tired of 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.090
 his flat on the floor and were 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.179
 to float through the game 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.520
 the moon never sandra the moon menstruates by 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.249
 days and you're always wondering 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.929
 What the fuck am I doing with my life? 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.999
 playing this shit 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.670
 has several molds that left the game 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:31.279
 even more fucking this fucking has barely 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.849
 players much less good molds 

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:37.849
 kaká has swords arches and picks 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.170
 Colorful pirogue for you to do what? 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.219

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.060
 attempt that was very wrong to copy 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.279

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.679
