00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.890
 In the e3 of the angels the first images of the 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.410
 cooperative online multiplayer mode that receive and physicists a whole surprise that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.300
 the countless fans of this famous saga have been waiting for a long time 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.809
 as we already knew that this one between that they place us africa being the 

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.369
 protagonist of the written story instimed that we could already know in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.629
 previous chapters of the series although since then aspect has changed a lot 

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.020
 I think it's the potential that new consoles can offer us now 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.480
 generation 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.870
 also the second playable character of the title will be and if not the most a young 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.630
 which makes its debut in the series that accompanied us throughout the opening 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.069
 of the appointment there was who controlled it 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.960
 in the case that it does not 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 we go in alone 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.480
 your help will be essential to be able to overcome many of the situations with 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 those that we will find in the rest of the game although as we said the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 forward it will also be possible to play cooperatively next to a second 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 on my own and the online connection something that without usual place will become 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 one of its biggest attractions 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.430
 besides these two protagonists can help each other out of many 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 ways like for example exchange to be the city that you feel and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.010
 something that will be very useful for the urethra ashes 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.330
 much more effectively in inventories without us having 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.260
 that resorting to the classic paul is so characteristic of the series 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.880
 and this is not all because if one of the characters is shot at the hotel 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 will have valuable seconds in which you can heal people will return to the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 life being able to continue the game both players 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.880
 Resident Evil 5 will go on sale next year 2009 for platforms 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.290
