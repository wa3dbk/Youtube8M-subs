camera you can give you better image we

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.670 
camera you can give you better image we
can<00:03:34.650> check<00:03:34.859> about<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:39.889> here

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
can check about it right now so here

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.930 
can check about it right now so here
let's<00:03:43.680> focus<00:03:44.100> on<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.550> Box<00:03:44.820> yourself<00:03:46.640> out<00:03:47.640> of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
let's focus on the Box yourself out of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.170 
let's focus on the Box yourself out of
focus<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.500> explore<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.430> very<00:03:50.760> clear

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
focus and explore this is very clear

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.750 
focus and explore this is very clear
let's<00:03:51.900> take<00:03:52.050> photo<00:03:52.320> right<00:03:52.560> now

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:22.350 

and<00:04:00.959> ok<00:04:03.360> yeah<00:04:04.360> not<00:04:04.659> follow

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.180 

so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
so

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.050 
so
on<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.760> second<00:04:25.240> page<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:26.020> camera<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.620> have

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
on a second page of the camera you have

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.000 
on a second page of the camera you have
many<00:04:28.060> other<00:04:28.270> choices<00:04:28.510> like<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:32.890> get

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
many other choices like you can get

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.250 
many other choices like you can get
different<00:04:33.220> effect<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.150> get<00:04:35.080> different

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
different effect and get different

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.700 
different effect and get different
tolerance<00:04:36.150> when<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.270> shooting<00:04:37.930> for<00:04:37.960> shooting

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
tolerance when you shooting for shooting

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:52.679 
tolerance when you shooting for shooting
an<00:04:38.800> image<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:40.200> they<00:04:41.200> also<00:04:42.930> record<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.260> video

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.439 

after<00:04:53.439> talking<00:04:53.649> about<00:04:53.979> Cameron<00:04:54.610> let's<00:04:55.209> check

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
after talking about Cameron let's check

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.070 
after talking about Cameron let's check
how<00:04:55.749> the<00:04:55.779> heart<00:04:56.409> of<00:04:56.799> the<00:04:56.830> mx4<00:04:57.639> looks<00:04:57.969> like<00:04:58.179> yes

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
how the heart of the mx4 looks like yes

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.789 
how the heart of the mx4 looks like yes
we<00:04:59.319> have<00:04:59.469> a<00:04:59.499> very<00:05:00.029> useful<00:05:01.029> ATP<00:05:01.779> at<00:05:01.839> the<00:05:02.049> end<00:05:02.229> 22

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:02.799 
we have a very useful ATP at the end 22

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:06.509 
we have a very useful ATP at the end 22
I<00:05:03.009> think<00:05:03.399> everybody<00:05:03.789> knows<00:05:03.909> knows<00:05:04.599> it<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.979> here

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:06.519 
I think everybody knows knows it so here

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.899 
I think everybody knows knows it so here
we<00:05:06.549> can<00:05:06.939> see<00:05:07.329> the<00:05:07.360> basic<00:05:08.049> information<00:05:08.909> after

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909
