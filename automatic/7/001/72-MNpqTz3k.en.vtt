but I guess with this they kind of can

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.389 
but I guess with this they kind of can
and<00:01:39.409> that's<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:42.560> grooved<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and that's all grooved as well then I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
and that's all grooved as well then I
think<00:01:44.430> quite<00:01:44.700> telling<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> camera<00:01:46.040> that's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
think quite telling the camera that's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.899 
think quite telling the camera that's
all<00:01:47.159> grooved<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.610> well<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:49.740> zing<00:01:50.520> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
all grooved as well and with zing you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.219 
all grooved as well and with zing you
get<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> paw<00:01:52.140> print<00:01:53.720> with<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> case-mate

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.270 
well so same sort of thing all the
cutouts<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.170> exactly<00:03:16.530> say<00:03:16.740> except<00:03:17.100> with<00:03:17.190> this

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
cutouts I exactly say except with this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.100
