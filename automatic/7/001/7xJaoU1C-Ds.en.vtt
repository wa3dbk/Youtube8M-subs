00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
like Voltron you know like the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.210

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
movie I think brain freeze is kind of

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.809 
movie I think brain freeze is kind of
like<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> closest<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.310> can<00:03:53.489> get<00:03:53.669> to
