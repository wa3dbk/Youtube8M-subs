so<00:00:00.750> after<00:00:01.410> doing<00:00:01.560> all<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.700> designing<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.480> your

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so after doing all the designing of your

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.070 
so after doing all the designing of your
page<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.589> export<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.549> HTML<00:00:06.509> so

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
page you have to export it in HTML so

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320 
page you have to export it in HTML so
that<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.649> use<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.490> green<00:00:08.760> viewer<00:00:09.120> and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
that you can use it in green viewer and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
that you can use it in green viewer and
additives<00:00:10.429> contents<00:00:11.429> etc<00:00:12.590> now<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
additives contents etc now what is a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
additives contents etc now what is a
slice<00:00:15.590> slice<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.060> slicing<00:00:18.060> means<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.750> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
slice slice is slicing means that you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040 
slice slice is slicing means that you
have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.650> chop<00:00:20.070> your<00:00:20.310> images<00:00:20.970> chopping<00:00:21.930> your

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
have to chop your images chopping your

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.390 
have to chop your images chopping your
images<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:22.949> pieces<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.859> putting<00:00:25.859> them<00:00:26.130> into

images into pieces and putting them into

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
images into pieces and putting them into
cells<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.920> how<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.130> slice<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:30.029> image<00:00:30.510> let

cells and how we can slice an image let
me<00:00:31.969> give<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.120> an<00:00:33.390> example<00:00:35.180> choose<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.360> tool

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
me give you an example choose a tool

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.729 
me give you an example choose a tool
from<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.710> area<00:00:38.780> whether<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:40.079> tool<00:00:40.260> panel<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
from your area whether your tool panel a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.720 
from your area whether your tool panel a
slice<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.660> hear<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.520> see

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
slice to hear it is and you will see

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.029 
slice to hear it is and you will see
that<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:45.180> cursor<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:45.870> change<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.890> can

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that your cursor is now change you can

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.080 
that your cursor is now change you can
click<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> drag<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> create<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.870> slice<00:00:49.879> now<00:00:50.879> as

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
click and drag to create a slice now as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
click and drag to create a slice now as
you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.199> created<00:00:52.559> bundle<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you can see we have created bundle of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can see we have created bundle of
slices<00:00:53.910> before<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:55.140> slices<00:00:55.440> were

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
slices before these slices were

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
slices before these slices were
automatically<00:00:56.520> created<00:00:57.230> when<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
automatically created when we have

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.219 
automatically created when we have
published<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.910> buttons<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:02.930> do<00:01:03.930> remember

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
published these buttons and do remember

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.890 
published these buttons and do remember
there<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.250> restriction<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.450> cannot

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
there is a restriction that we cannot

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.340 
there is a restriction that we cannot
paste<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.530> slice<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> slice<00:01:09.119> slice<00:01:09.810> over

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
paste a slice on a slice slice over

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.539 
paste a slice on a slice slice over
making<00:01:10.650> overlapping<00:01:12.590> creates<00:01:13.590> many

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
making overlapping creates many

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.190 
making overlapping creates many
