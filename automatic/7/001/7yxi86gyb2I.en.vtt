00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
okay I don't know why people do that but

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.960 
okay I don't know why people do that but
it's<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.390> weird<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> me<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:22.100> anyways<00:02:22.370> that's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
it's just weird to me so anyways that's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.950 
it's just weird to me so anyways that's
that's<00:02:23.390> how<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.660> went<00:02:23.810> down

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's how that went down

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.390 
that's how that went down
I<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:24.560> know<00:02:24.620> why<00:02:24.770> he<00:02:24.980> needed<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
I don't know why he needed that I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490 
I don't know why he needed that I
thought<00:02:25.700> he<00:02:25.790> had<00:02:25.880> YouTube<00:02:26.270> YouTube<00:02:26.990> made<00:02:27.320> some

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
thought he had YouTube YouTube made some

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.190 
thought he had YouTube YouTube made some
money<00:02:27.620> off<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:29.050> apparently<00:02:30.050> not

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
money off of that but apparently not

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.040 
money off of that but apparently not
enough<00:02:30.350> um<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.820> was<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> problem<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.990> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
enough um so that was a problem now the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.450 
enough um so that was a problem now the
other<00:02:33.260> two<00:02:33.440> problems<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.950> have<00:02:34.070> are<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
other two problems that I have are is

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.370 
other two problems that I have are is
that<00:02:34.610> he's<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> he's<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.270> trying<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.930> be<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> Air

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
that he's a he's a trying to be a Air

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.370 
that he's a he's a trying to be a Air
Force<00:02:36.650> pilot<00:02:37.690> first<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.780> all<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:38.990> pretty<00:02:39.200> sure

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
Force pilot first of all I'm pretty sure

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.020 
Force pilot first of all I'm pretty sure
I<00:02:39.650> don't<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.040> don't<00:02:40.130> think<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.490> Air<00:02:40.790> Force

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
I don't I don't think the Air Force

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
I don't I don't think the Air Force
would<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.300> too<00:02:41.540> kind

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
would be too kind

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.820 
would be too kind
on<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.440> activity<00:02:43.120> but<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.870> worst<00:02:45.410> one<00:02:45.620> is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
on that activity but the worst one is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.660 
on that activity but the worst one is
that<00:02:45.980> he's<00:02:46.100> married

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
that he's married

that unless they really need money or

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.980 
that unless they really need money or
something<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.210> don't<00:03:20.360> know<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.750> really

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
something so I don't know it's really

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.920 
something so I don't know it's really
weird<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.560> can't<00:03:21.980> tell<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.660> can't<00:03:23.660> tell<00:03:23.840> you

what was going through his mind but I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
what was going through his mind but I
guess<00:03:25.490> he<00:03:25.610> just<00:03:25.640> really<00:03:25.970> needed<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.240> money

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
guess he just really needed the money

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.260 
guess he just really needed the money
