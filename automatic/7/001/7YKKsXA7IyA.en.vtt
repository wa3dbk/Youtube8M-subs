00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.809
 you have such a box 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 you can keep everything you like yourself 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 needs is a square piece 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.690
 paper 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 It does not matter what 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.289
 a paper is important 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 simply that it is relatively stable and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 maybe not that bad 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.090
 looks like normal white paper 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 maybe a bit boring for one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.330
 such boxes are what they are first and foremost 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.969
 the diagonal has to do 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.079
 wrinkles 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.160
 After that she took the paper in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.610
 the try out as seen when the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.530
 Diagonal second step you have to do the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 Corresponding corners so we would be much 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 piece to the middle fold like that and then 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.590
 Just press her down 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.260
 that's what you do for every single corner 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.770
 afterwards you have your paper now so 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.770
 appearance 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:11.070
 in the next step , new paper folded 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.409
 back on so and now you see here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.299
 already do some folding that now 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 the wall hedges have to be so 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.850
 lying opposite with the center 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.420
 points 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.420
 By that I mean that hold here and that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.930
 Laying here the corner in and fold 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.540
 that makes him again for each 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.680
 single page originated pattern falls 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.560
 would have to look like this 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.079
 Now, too, take the corner and you 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 until this first kink in the middle 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.899
 move and get it here as well 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.320
 that made up for each one again 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.320
 page 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.740
 Now you take a ferry to hand 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.580
 and cuts of branches over the time 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:27.870
 along the corners 24 corners 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 So far there and that one on the side 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.269
 and do the same here 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.600
 up there and there what will be next 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.920
 Do is do these oblong pages too 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 So do not take these here 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 but the here and sign the tips 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.420
 until the middle 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.250
 That should be relatively easy because we 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.920
 have folded ever work then 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.940
 Here we each have the pages high so that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.209
 they're so off and on the same 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:17.880
 the other side so and so and now 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.880
 let's just fold the pages like this 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:30.579
 First of all, that's roughly how it is 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:32.850
 little holds that is not so right 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.530
 keeps is completely normal 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.209
 Now you take the other pages 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.579
 and works this too high 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.989
 this little corner earlier and down 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.070
 Fold it here so pure 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:55.200
 the same on the other side 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:55.200
 hocheck fold over and rheine with 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.079
 Of course, the precise ones reprint 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.480
 that makes and where he folds that 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.730
 beautiful have the box and on the in 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.680
 Principle is the box is ready for 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.109
 small repair you can but one 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.540
 a little bit after press and again the 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.269
 Press edges for a long time 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.859
 to turn it down a bit 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.169
 and the box is finished in principle 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.789
 usually should hold so if 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.319
 somehow fold up something again 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.180
 what should not happen in the rule 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.780
 of course I could do with a little 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.919
 Liquid glue help 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.440
 if you could do two of these now 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.349
 liable and before at one of them 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.060
 have taken slightly smaller square 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.300
 you can have this perfectly 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.889
 put and as a right box 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.990
 use 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:53.310
 a part in my opinion perfect around 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.310
 to give away small items 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.889
 I hope the video failed and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.819
 helped 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.819
 Until next time
