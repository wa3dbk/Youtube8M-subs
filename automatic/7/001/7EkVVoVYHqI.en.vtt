00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to like it if he's flying in the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:35.450 
going to like it if he's flying in the
air

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:51.740 

okay<00:01:37.020> again<00:01:38.610> add<00:01:39.610> those<00:01:41.189> body<00:01:42.189> armor<00:01:42.640> skills

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.309 

lifted<00:01:52.750> from<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.149> then<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.049> want<00:01:59.259> to

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
lifted from you and then if you want to

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.460 
lifted from you and then if you want to
look<00:01:59.530> at<00:01:59.740> as<00:01:59.920> if<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.549> was<00:02:00.670> almost<00:02:01.470> growling

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
look at as if it was almost growling

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.440 
look at as if it was almost growling
like<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:03.220> can't<00:02:03.909> really<00:02:04.030> do<00:02:04.210> from<00:02:04.360> that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
like that I can't really do from that

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.289 
like that I can't really do from that
angle<00:02:04.569> but<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:06.009> pretty<00:02:06.280> much<00:02:06.399> do<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.819> exact

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
angle but you pretty much do the exact

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.630 
angle but you pretty much do the exact
same<00:02:07.450> thing

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
same thing

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.880 
same thing
there's<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.759> little<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.179> more<00:02:10.209> blunted<00:02:10.929> more

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
there's a little bit more blunted more

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.690 
there's a little bit more blunted more
do<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:12.940> much<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.860> diamond<00:02:15.130> itself<00:02:15.580> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
do so much of this diamond itself and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:45.830 
do so much of this diamond itself and
smashed<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.239> dry

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.929 

that's<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.989> really<00:02:47.260> Carol<00:02:47.650> view<00:02:47.920> or<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.730> could

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
that's a really Carol view or I could

00:02:48.939 --> 00:03:06.940 
that's a really Carol view or I could
just<00:02:48.969> simply<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.590> freehand

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.940 

and<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.270> your<00:03:08.590> lifted<00:03:09.590> views<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.959> then

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
and you have your lifted views and then

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.630 
and you have your lifted views and then
of<00:03:13.040> course<00:03:13.099> you<00:03:13.370> can<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.670> your<00:03:13.849> hands<00:03:15.520> we<00:03:16.520> have

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
of course you can do your hands we have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.130 
of course you can do your hands we have
to<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:16.849> your<00:03:16.970> sideview<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.660> lifted<00:03:20.020> front<00:03:21.020> curl

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
to do your sideview of lifted front curl

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.300 
to do your sideview of lifted front curl
and<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:25.700> course<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.150> also<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.600> your<00:03:26.840> sight

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
and of course you also have your sight

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.479 
and of course you also have your sight
lifted<00:03:31.989> which<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.620> duplicating

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
lifted which is just duplicating

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:47.430 
lifted which is just duplicating
everything<00:03:34.880> else<00:03:35.060> you're<00:03:35.810> just<00:03:35.989> making<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:04:08.550 

extra<00:03:48.440> toe

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.630 

another<00:04:09.430> side<00:04:09.730> view<00:04:11.160> I'm<00:04:12.160> gonna<00:04:12.430> draw<00:04:12.550> another

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
another side view I'm gonna draw another

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:36.620 
another side view I'm gonna draw another
one<00:04:12.880> just<00:04:13.500> just<00:04:14.500> because

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:47.320 

they're<00:04:37.630> both<00:04:37.810> side<00:04:38.380> use

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.300 

no<00:04:48.220> side

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.090 

curl<00:04:54.740> flashlight<00:04:56.570> now<00:04:57.570> these<00:04:58.530> will<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.889> your

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
curl flashlight now these will be your

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.930 
curl flashlight now these will be your
basic<00:04:59.790> forms<00:05:00.470> again<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> do<00:05:02.610> basic

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
basic forms again I like to do basic

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.230 
basic forms again I like to do basic
things<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:04.620> then<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:04.950> add<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.550> which<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:06.090> how

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
things and then I add to it which is how
