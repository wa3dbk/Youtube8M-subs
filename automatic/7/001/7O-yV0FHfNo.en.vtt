00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:58.170
 mentor and blending forest 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.170
 other effect I think is the best 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.229
 with those balls I think it is one of the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.269
 cutest sheets out there that ties all of those 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.479

 well how do you do that and what do you have 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.490
 from so look of syrups 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.950

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.570

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.289
 stick the seal on with that there 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.789
 usable tape from a person you breed 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.880
 too large so that it stays nicely straight 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.880
 to learn 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 and have our sponge 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 brushes yes i know exactly how the one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.689
 but a sponge z4 comes in our store 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.490
 at the bottom or to the and of the video too 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 stand 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.710
 well what am i doing now i am very proud of it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.369
 my maternity sheet and why on that grazie 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.569
 that can have a lot of heat and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.939
 a lot of filth you had one 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.500
 cloth over it's a school 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:12.269
 then I start with my mind like that and I dep 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.269
 just in my lid 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 and then I'm just going to go on top 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 to work 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.650
 Well he is simple when you see it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.840
 beautiful van gessel or none so that one 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.099
 so you can use everything for anything 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 for example, you can also use wood with it 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.790
 you don't have to shed and edit first 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.380
 and for you it can be together 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.799
 use after one you see like here 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.980
 I use it as a background and that is 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.980
 pretty simple 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.959
 see this is a difference if you don't 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.910
 even the got is not bad that I pat it 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.829
 just nice about the rest of the van 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.500
 paper one 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:06.810
 it's handy if you make sure you have one 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.010
 son lotion wipes clear do not commit 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.100
 just oil me a pure lotion 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.200
 cloth so that you see the plastic 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.760
 clean immediately 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920
 used retirement because if you go up the stairs 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 let never get a never never 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.970
 more off well I think I'll take a look 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.769
 years the same 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.530
 I now put this in the jar right away 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.880
 I talk to banker garden so I stand up 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.079
 him later how can flush your path 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.190
 mind so that really doesn't go like this and here 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.190
 I pull carefully 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.130
 I put it away for a moment and with this me 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.130
 towel ready and the herent 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.200
 ok you see how easy it is then 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.200
 goes off again 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.360
 diandra attention can dry 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.490
 ideal that crash something closet their patients 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:07.460
 but if you work on this I would 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.870
 don't want to give anything else and me 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.770
 dry kitchen towel i am also wearing you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.470
 learning by default in my guides 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.470
 Just from C1000 or so other buy brand 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.610
 well see that's is just with my wife 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.460
 is nice and clean again 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.950
 who can and you can leave 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.320
 not to put in a container with water there 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.180
 I let this learn 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.580
 you can also clean it with the know 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.370
 dry with you below I do that 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.370
 I'd rather not leave you here like this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 to dry 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.980
 ok I draw for say a little paper 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.510
 sitting on the board makes an account so that is 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.120
 not that bad 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.160
 you see how nice that is uh sample like that 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.410
 so make your own background and free 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.510
 lie is not so difficult 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.040
 everyone can be a kree so this kind of 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.870
 this is nice cards with 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.169

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.270

 in this is also white watercolor paper that is 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.470
 harder to see 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.720
