I'm<00:00:17.470> going<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.740> talk<00:00:17.860> about<00:00:18.010> now<00:00:18.220> is<00:00:18.280> top

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
I'm going to talk about now is top

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.670 
I'm going to talk about now is top
shotting<00:00:19.000> top<00:00:19.570> selling<00:00:19.810> involves<00:00:20.380> getting

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
shotting top selling involves getting

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.830 
shotting top selling involves getting
some<00:00:20.890> additional<00:00:21.490> line<00:00:21.939> like<00:00:22.150> braided<00:00:22.660> line

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
some additional line like braided line

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.080 
some additional line like braided line
and<00:00:23.140> putting<00:00:23.470> on<00:00:23.590> top<00:00:23.890> of<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.279> spool<00:00:24.580> that's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
and putting on top of a spool that's

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.179 
and putting on top of a spool that's
been<00:00:25.300> bulked<00:00:25.689> out<00:00:25.840> with<00:00:26.080> some<00:00:26.349> backing<00:00:26.590> the

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
been bulked out with some backing the

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.589 
been bulked out with some backing the
reason<00:00:27.519> for<00:00:27.670> doing<00:00:27.789> this<00:00:28.029> is<00:00:28.269> that<00:00:28.359> most

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
reason for doing this is that most

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.720 
reason for doing this is that most
fishing<00:00:29.109> reels<00:00:29.289> these<00:00:29.500> days<00:00:29.769> have<00:00:30.369> spools

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
fishing reels these days have spools

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.010 
fishing reels these days have spools
that<00:00:30.910> are<00:00:31.119> still<00:00:31.330> designed<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.869> take

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
that are still designed to take

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.780 
that are still designed to take
monofilament<00:00:32.500> line<00:00:32.860> which<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.280> lot<00:00:33.490> thicker

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
monofilament line which is a lot thicker

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.030 
monofilament line which is a lot thicker
than<00:00:34.120> braided<00:00:34.540> line<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:35.620> if<00:00:35.739> we<00:00:35.860> were<00:00:35.980> to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
than braided line and if we were to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.100 
than braided line and if we were to
spool<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.399> whole<00:00:36.730> spool<00:00:37.149> up<00:00:37.329> with<00:00:37.510> braided<00:00:37.930> line

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
spool a whole spool up with braided line

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.500 
spool a whole spool up with braided line
a<00:00:38.410> it's<00:00:39.100> very<00:00:39.309> expensive<00:00:39.879> because<00:00:39.969> braid<00:00:40.329> is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
a it's very expensive because braid is

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.250 
a it's very expensive because braid is
very<00:00:40.719> expensive

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
very expensive

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.319 
very expensive
plus<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:41.950> utilizing<00:00:42.610> more<00:00:42.789> line<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.270> we

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
plus it's utilizing more line that we

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.060 
plus it's utilizing more line that we
really<00:00:43.600> need<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:44.320> top<00:00:44.530> shotting<00:00:44.890> just

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
really need to so top shotting just

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.920 
really need to so top shotting just
means<00:00:45.280> getting<00:00:45.550> some<00:00:45.760> monofilament<00:00:45.940> putting

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
means getting some monofilament putting

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.720 
means getting some monofilament putting
it<00:00:47.020> on<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.289> base<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.500> your<00:00:47.739> spool<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.250> then

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
it on the base of your spool and then

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.970 
it on the base of your spool and then
we'll<00:00:49.120> cover<00:00:49.600> up<00:00:49.719> with<00:00:49.930> some<00:00:50.170> braided<00:00:50.559> line<00:00:50.770> as

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
we'll cover up with some braided line as

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.310 
we'll cover up with some braided line as
a<00:00:51.010> top<00:00:51.309> shot<00:00:51.579> there's<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.570> few<00:00:52.780> different<00:00:53.110> knots

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
a top shot there's a few different knots

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.660 
a top shot there's a few different knots
and<00:00:53.559> connections<00:00:54.039> that<00:00:54.100> we're<00:00:54.280> going<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.460> use

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
and connections that we're going to use

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.880 
and connections that we're going to use
I'm<00:00:55.090> going<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.480> show<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.750> probably<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.500> best

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
I'm going to show you probably the best

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.319 
I'm going to show you probably the best
connection<00:00:57.309> or<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.699> most<00:00:57.940> correct

connection or the most correct

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.240 
connection or the most correct
connection<00:00:58.840> but<00:00:59.530> there<00:00:59.680> are<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.829> couple<00:01:00.100> of

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
connection but there are a couple of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.709 
connection but there are a couple of
easier<00:01:00.609> ways<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.180> I'll<00:01:01.269> show<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.510> how<00:01:01.660> to

monofilament backing on the reel and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.490 
monofilament backing on the reel and
I've<00:01:23.890> also<00:01:24.420> tied<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> Bimini<00:01:25.930> twist<00:01:26.200> that's<00:01:26.440> a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
I've also tied a Bimini twist that's a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.410 
I've also tied a Bimini twist that's a
little<00:01:26.740> bit<00:01:26.860> longer<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.550> braid<00:01:27.940> but

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
little bit longer in the braid but

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.450 
little bit longer in the braid but
additional<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.380> I've<00:01:29.770> got<00:01:30.100> another

additional to that I've got another

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.010 
additional to that I've got another
little<00:01:30.610> connection<00:01:31.270> I'm<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:31.630> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> show

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
little connection I'm just going to show

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.820 
little connection I'm just going to show
you<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.410> moment

this<00:01:33.550> isn't<00:01:33.940> tied<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.390> dark<00:01:34.630> braided<00:01:35.080> line<00:01:35.230> so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
this isn't tied in dark braided line so

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.510 
this isn't tied in dark braided line so
it's<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> be<00:01:35.800> too<00:01:35.950> hard<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.220> show<00:01:36.460> you

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
it's going to be too hard to show you

knot to tie a double surgeon's knot I've

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.280 
knot to tie a double surgeon's knot I've
already<00:01:45.370> got<00:01:45.640> my<00:01:45.670> Bimini<00:01:46.150> twist<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.780> imagine

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
already got my Bimini twist and imagine

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.840 
already got my Bimini twist and imagine
this<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.710> braid<00:01:47.950> we're<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.460> showing<00:01:48.640> you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
this is in braid we're just showing you

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.400 
this is in braid we're just showing you
in<00:01:48.970> thick<00:01:49.180> monofilament<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.170> easy<00:01:50.320> to

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
in thick monofilament so it's easy to

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.770 
in thick monofilament so it's easy to
see<00:01:50.710> I'm<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.880> going<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> fold<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.750> bottom

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
see I'm just going to fold the bottom

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.080 
see I'm just going to fold the bottom
half<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> loop<00:01:54.400> over<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.820> I'm<00:01:54.910> going<00:01:55.000> to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
half of that loop over and I'm going to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.790 
half of that loop over and I'm going to
pinch<00:01:55.330> that<00:01:55.570> line<00:01:55.780> between<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.410> thumb<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.740> my

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
pinch that line between my thumb and my

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.190 
pinch that line between my thumb and my
index<00:01:56.860> finger<00:01:57.520> on<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.730> Bimini<00:01:58.630> twist<00:01:58.930> I'm

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
index finger on the Bimini twist I'm

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.770 
index finger on the Bimini twist I'm
just<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.680> run<00:01:59.920> my<00:02:00.130> finger<00:02:00.550> out<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.000> pull

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
just going to run my finger out and pull

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.750 
just going to run my finger out and pull
it<00:02:01.900> through<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> reason<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.340> doing<00:02:03.490> this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
it through and the reason for doing this

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.120 
it through and the reason for doing this
is<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.720> want<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.050> make<00:02:05.200> sure<00:02:05.230> that<00:02:05.770> both

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
is that I want to make sure that both

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.669 
is that I want to make sure that both
strands<00:02:06.610> are<00:02:06.790> line<00:02:06.970> stay<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.170> same<00:02:08.379> length

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
strands are line stay the same length

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.160 
strands are line stay the same length
because<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:09.160> they're<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.399> then<00:02:09.910> only<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:11.020> of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
because if they're not then only one of

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.600 
because if they're not then only one of
those<00:02:11.260> strands<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.800> going<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.070> taking<00:02:12.490> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
those strands is going to be taking a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
those strands is going to be taking a
load<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:13.060> defeated<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.570> purpose<00:02:13.930> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
load of defeated the purpose of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.520 
load of defeated the purpose of
they're<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> first<00:02:15.210> place<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.320> now

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
they're not in the first place so now

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
they're not in the first place so now
once<00:02:16.800> I've<00:02:16.950> run<00:02:17.160> those<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:17.790> happy

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
once I've run those out and I'm happy

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300 
once I've run those out and I'm happy
they're<00:02:18.240> both<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> same<00:02:18.780> length<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:19.440> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
they're both the same length I'm just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.580 
they're both the same length I'm just
going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:21.470> get<00:02:22.470> all<00:02:22.740> four<00:02:23.160> strands<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.730> line

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
going to get all four strands of line

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.980 
going to get all four strands of line
cross<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.770> over<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.060> though<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> were<00:02:27.930> the

cross it over just as though it were the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.430 
cross it over just as though it were the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
start of a granny knot better tidy those

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.930 
start of a granny knot better tidy those
loops<00:02:31.800> up<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.460> we're<00:02:32.550> going<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> pass

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
loops up and then we're going to pass

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.370 
loops up and then we're going to pass
those<00:02:33.300> loops<00:02:33.660> from<00:02:34.170> away<00:02:34.650> from<00:02:34.980> me<00:02:35.130> towards<00:02:35.700> me

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
those loops from away from me towards me

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.550 
those loops from away from me towards me
through<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.590> loop<00:02:37.770> once<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> come

through that loop once I'm going to come

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.350 
through that loop once I'm going to come
back<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.640> again<00:02:41.760> back

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
back and I'm going to do it again back

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.710 
back and I'm going to do it again back
through<00:02:43.250> make<00:02:44.250> sure<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.670> both<00:02:44.970> loops<00:02:45.330> pass

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
through the loop that I've tied now this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.950 
through the loop that I've tied now this
is<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:51.000> important<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.540> make<00:02:51.720> sure<00:02:51.750> that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
is really important to make sure that

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.190 
is really important to make sure that
both<00:02:52.410> loops<00:02:53.250> tie<00:02:53.640> up<00:02:53.820> nice<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.420> tidy<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.080> I'm

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
both loops tie up nice and tidy and I'm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440 
both loops tie up nice and tidy and I'm
going<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> hold<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.850> close<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.390> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
going to hold it right up close to the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.290 
going to hold it right up close to the
knot<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.870> pull<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.170> tight<00:03:01.670> get<00:03:02.670> my<00:03:02.820> finger

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
knot and pull it tight get my finger

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.350 
knot and pull it tight get my finger
inside<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.380> loop<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.400> bimini<00:03:05.730> pull<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
inside the loop and the bimini pull that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.380 
inside the loop and the bimini pull that
tight<00:03:06.740> pull<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.890> bimini<00:03:08.250> tight<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.850> then

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
tight pull the bimini tight and then

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.870 
tight pull the bimini tight and then
pull<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> bottom<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> loop<00:03:11.280> tight<00:03:11.580> and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
pull the bottom of the loop tight and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.170 
pull the bottom of the loop tight and
then<00:03:12.150> I'll<00:03:12.270> snip<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.840> off<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.320> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
then I'll snip that off there and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
then I'll snip that off there and
that'll<00:03:15.180> give<00:03:15.360> me<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.780> double<00:03:16.590> sergers<00:03:17.160> loop<00:03:17.400> so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
that'll give me a double sergers loop so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.510 
that'll give me a double sergers loop so
now<00:03:18.360> instead<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.810> having<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.860> strand<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.400> line

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
now instead of having one strand of line

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.970 
now instead of having one strand of line
I've<00:03:20.700> got<00:03:20.850> two<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:22.020> doubles<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.530> surface

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
I've got two that doubles the surface

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.130 
I've got two that doubles the surface
area<00:03:23.340> haves<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.940> cutting<00:03:24.270> potential<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
area haves the cutting potential and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.470 
area haves the cutting potential and
it's<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.380> much<00:03:25.680> more<00:03:26.130> secure<00:03:26.730> connection<00:03:27.330> when

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
it's a much more secure connection when

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080 
it's a much more secure connection when
you<00:03:27.600> join<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.050> two<00:03:28.230> loops<00:03:28.440> together<00:03:28.850> okay<00:03:29.850> now

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
you join the two loops together okay now

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.699 
you join the two loops together okay now
that<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.600> Bimini<00:03:30.989> twist<00:03:31.230> loop<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.680> my

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
that I have my Bimini twist loop in my

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.370 
that I have my Bimini twist loop in my
mono<00:03:32.070> backing<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> reel<00:03:32.970> i've<00:03:33.660> also<00:03:34.110> tied

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
mono backing on the reel i've also tied

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.620 
mono backing on the reel i've also tied
my<00:03:34.709> Bimini<00:03:35.160> twist<00:03:35.430> loop<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> braid<00:03:36.300> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
my Bimini twist loop in the braid and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.240 
my Bimini twist loop in the braid and
I've<00:03:36.750> then<00:03:36.989> doubled<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.470> over<00:03:37.709> with<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> double

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
I've then doubled it over with a double

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.490 
I've then doubled it over with a double
surgeon's<00:03:38.730> knot<00:03:38.940> I'm<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.930> join<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.350> two

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
surgeon's knot I'm going to join the two

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.290 
surgeon's knot I'm going to join the two
lines<00:03:40.709> together<00:03:40.950> by<00:03:41.310> effectively<00:03:41.910> putting<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
lines together by effectively putting a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.880 
lines together by effectively putting a
loop<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.660> loop<00:03:42.690> connection<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:43.739> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
loop to loop connection but because it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.650 
loop to loop connection but because it
needs<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.670> secure<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.390> really

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
needs to be really secure and really

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.210 
needs to be really secure and really
strong<00:03:45.930> I'm<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.709> do<00:03:46.769> something<00:03:47.160> a

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
strong I'm going to do something a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.340 
strong I'm going to do something a
little<00:03:47.250> bit<00:03:47.610> different<00:03:48.060> I'll<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.140> show<00:03:49.320> you

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
little bit different I'll just show you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.570 
little bit different I'll just show you
how<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.650> do<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:49.920> we're<00:03:50.100> going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.280> get<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
how to do that we're going to get the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.580 
how to do that we're going to get the
monofilament<00:03:51.120> I'm<00:03:51.540> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.870> put<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.290> through

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
monofilament I'm going to put it through

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.120 
monofilament I'm going to put it through
the<00:03:53.280> braided<00:03:53.700> line<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:55.500> I'm<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the braided line and then I'm going to

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.290 
the braided line and then I'm going to
pass<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.850> spool<00:03:58.100> back<00:03:59.100> through<00:03:59.580> the<00:04:00.090> mono

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
pass the spool back through the mono

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.830 
pass the spool back through the mono
then<00:04:01.260> I'm<00:04:01.350> going<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> grab<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.950> mono<00:04:02.160> again

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
then I'm going to grab the mono again

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.440 
then I'm going to grab the mono again
and<00:04:03.840> we're<00:04:03.930> going<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.080> pass<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.590> over<00:04:04.800> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
and we're going to pass it over the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.790 
and we're going to pass it over the
spool<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.600> braid<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.170> I'm<00:04:07.560> going<00:04:07.739> to

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
spool the braid and I'm going to

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.130 
spool the braid and I'm going to
continue<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.910> I'm<00:04:09.510> trying<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.959> keep

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
continue to do this I'm trying to keep

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.840 
continue to do this I'm trying to keep
all<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.470> line<00:04:10.650> under<00:04:10.950> control<00:04:11.370> because<00:04:11.670> it's

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
all the line under control because it's

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.210 
all the line under control because it's
pretty<00:04:12.090> easy<00:04:12.360> for<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.110> get<00:04:13.860> out<00:04:14.070> of

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
pretty easy for this to get out of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.949 
pretty easy for this to get out of
control<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.940> I've<00:04:15.030> actually<00:04:15.209> got<00:04:15.480> some<00:04:15.510> tape

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
control and I've actually got some tape

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.630 
control and I've actually got some tape
on<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.350> braid<00:04:16.560> here<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.010> stop<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.430> from

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
on the braid here to stop that from

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.479 
on the braid here to stop that from
coming<00:04:17.820> undone

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
coming undone

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.180 
coming undone
and<00:04:19.389> I've<00:04:19.509> got<00:04:19.660> my<00:04:19.780> fingers<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.380> my<00:04:20.859> finger

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
and I've got my fingers and my finger

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.520 
and I've got my fingers and my finger
and<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:21.519> thumb<00:04:21.549> in<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.780> loops<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.169> keep<00:04:23.350> them

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
and my thumb in the loops to keep them

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.469 
and my thumb in the loops to keep them
open<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.520> they<00:04:24.699> don't<00:04:24.910> collapse<00:04:25.240> on

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
open so they don't collapse on

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.689 
open so they don't collapse on
themselves<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.830> we're<00:04:26.949> gonna<00:04:27.039> do<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.400> about

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
themselves and we're gonna do this about

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.830 
themselves and we're gonna do this about
half<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.150> dozen<00:04:28.300> times<00:04:30.240> once<00:04:31.240> I've<00:04:31.419> done<00:04:31.569> that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
half a dozen times once I've done that

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.760 
half a dozen times once I've done that
you<00:04:32.560> probably<00:04:32.949> see<00:04:33.220> here<00:04:34.050> I've<00:04:35.050> formed<00:04:35.620> a

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
you probably see here I've formed a

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.070 
you probably see here I've formed a
series<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.400> twists<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.509> braid<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
series of twists in the braid and the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.600 
series of twists in the braid and the
mono<00:04:38.259> and<00:04:39.160> now<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.180> need<00:04:40.539> to<00:04:40.599> grab<00:04:41.610> both

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
mono and now I just need to grab both

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.200 
mono and now I just need to grab both
connections<00:04:43.330> at<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.870> knot<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.699> slowly<00:04:45.699> draw

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
connections at the knot and slowly draw

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.790 
connections at the knot and slowly draw
them<00:04:46.419> together<00:04:46.599> this<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.020> called<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> cat's

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
them together this is called the cat's

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.890 
them together this is called the cat's
paw<00:04:48.099> splices<00:04:48.819> it's<00:04:48.940> quite<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.150> common<00:04:49.449> knot<00:04:49.720> in

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
paw splices it's quite a common knot in

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.469 
paw splices it's quite a common knot in
game<00:04:50.139> fishing<00:04:50.440> circles<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:52.060> really

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
game fishing circles and it's really

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.529 
game fishing circles and it's really
coming<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.930> attainment<00:04:53.530> with<00:04:53.680> braided<00:04:54.160> lines

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
coming to attainment with braided lines

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.969 
coming to attainment with braided lines
so<00:04:55.539> what<00:04:55.690> I'm<00:04:55.810> effectively<00:04:56.289> doing<00:04:56.740> is<00:04:56.830> I'm

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
so what I'm effectively doing is I'm

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.760 
so what I'm effectively doing is I'm
drawing<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.699> nice<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.240> tight<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.710> then

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
drawing that nice and tight and then

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.650 
drawing that nice and tight and then
once<00:05:00.039> I've<00:05:00.250> got<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.729> start<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.240> buy<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.479> on

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
once I've got it to start to buy it on

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.629 
once I've got it to start to buy it on
itself<00:05:01.990> I'm<00:05:02.289> just<00:05:02.560> going<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.770> gently<00:05:03.070> work<00:05:03.460> it

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
itself I'm just going to gently work it

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.689 
itself I'm just going to gently work it
down<00:05:03.880> work<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.479> down<00:05:04.919> work<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.099> down<00:05:06.310> until<00:05:06.580> it

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
down work it down work it down until it

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.080 
down work it down work it down until it
comes<00:05:06.910> all<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.330> way<00:05:07.360> down<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.770> bottom<00:05:09.090> so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
comes all the way down to the bottom so

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.700 
comes all the way down to the bottom so
now<00:05:10.120> that<00:05:10.479> I've<00:05:10.690> drawn<00:05:10.930> that<00:05:11.169> tight<00:05:11.409> you<00:05:11.590> can

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
now that I've drawn that tight you can

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.680 
now that I've drawn that tight you can
see<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:12.099> that's<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.370> really<00:05:12.880> slim<00:05:13.210> secure

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
see that that's a really slim secure

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.870 
see that that's a really slim secure
finish<00:05:14.080> it'll<00:05:14.800> go<00:05:14.919> on<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.430> off<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.699> wheel

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
finish it'll go on and off the wheel

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.980 
finish it'll go on and off the wheel
without<00:05:16.060> any<00:05:16.419> problems

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
without any problems

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.080 
without any problems
it's<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.620> braided<00:05:17.949> top<00:05:18.340> shot<00:05:18.639> onto<00:05:19.060> a

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090
