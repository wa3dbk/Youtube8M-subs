effect also each one of these satellites
has<00:01:01.109> lights<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.090> will

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
has lights is actually one which will

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960 
has lights is actually one which will
appear<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.110> top<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.980> another<00:01:05.670> at

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
appear at the very top and another at

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
appear at the very top and another at
the<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.600> center<00:01:07.050> I'll<00:01:07.140> show<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the very center I'll show you what that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
the very center I'll show you what that
looks<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.190> little<00:01:08.580> later<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.910> in<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
looks like a little later on in the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
looks like a little later on in the
video<00:01:09.690> review<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.380> each<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.310> these

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
video review and each one these

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.140 
video review and each one these
satellites<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.690> six<00:01:13.440> watts<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.520> subwoofer<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
satellites is six watts the subwoofer is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
satellites is six watts the subwoofer is
30<00:01:15.690> watts<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.710> subwoofer<00:01:17.160> is<00:01:17.490> also

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
30 watts and the subwoofer is also

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
30 watts and the subwoofer is also
wooden<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.750> means<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
wooden so that means it's going to have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
wooden so that means it's going to have
some<00:01:19.710> rock<00:01:19.950> solid<00:01:20.400> base<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.360> whole

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
some rock solid base and the whole

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
some rock solid base and the whole
system<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.079> shielded<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
system is shielded so you don't have to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.090 
system is shielded so you don't have to
worry<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.670> being<00:01:24.000> close<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> CRT<00:01:25.290> display

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
worry about being close to a CRT display

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
worry about being close to a CRT display
at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> subwoofer<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.750> where

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
at the back of the subwoofer is where

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
at the back of the subwoofer is where
you<00:01:28.049> make<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.920> connections<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you make all the connections and at the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
you make all the connections and at the
top<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.240> you've<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.930> frequency<00:01:31.590> adjust

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
top here you've got a frequency adjust

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
top here you've got a frequency adjust
so<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.220> adjust<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> frequency<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so you can adjust the frequency all the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.319 
so you can adjust the frequency all the
way<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.600> 30<00:01:33.899> Hertz<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> way<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.329> 700

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
way from 30 Hertz all the way up to 700

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.480 
way from 30 Hertz all the way up to 700
Hertz<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> very<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.729> audio<00:01:39.180> in
