them off now and it'll save you a lot of

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:53.259 
them off now and it'll save you a lot of
extra<00:03:44.329> step<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.989> sin<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:52.280> was<00:03:52.370> done<00:03:52.609> that

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
extra step of sin and it was done that

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.289 
extra step of sin and it was done that
was<00:03:53.359> it<00:03:53.480> take<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:55.370> then<00:03:55.519> put<00:03:55.730> these<00:03:55.849> on<00:03:56.060> top

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
was it take and then put these on top

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.740 
was it take and then put these on top
the<00:03:56.569> candy<00:03:56.870> dad<00:03:56.989> would<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.680> yeah<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:59.480> didn't

the candy dad would be yeah that didn't

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.990 
the candy dad would be yeah that didn't
sound<00:03:59.870> right<00:04:00.370> I've<00:04:01.370> done<00:04:01.549> up<00:04:01.669> to<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.819> point

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
what I've done up to this point is I've

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.140 
what I've done up to this point is I've
base<00:04:12.230> coded<00:04:12.530> everything<00:04:12.620> black<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.400> brought

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
base coded everything black I brought

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.400 
base coded everything black I brought
the<00:04:14.269> bike<00:04:14.389> back<00:04:14.660> over<00:04:14.900> here<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.109> we've

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
the bike back over here and we've

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.680 
the bike back over here and we've
reassembled<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:16.160> now<00:04:16.700> at<00:04:16.849> this<00:04:17.000> point<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.479> went

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
reassembled it now at this point I went

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.270 
reassembled it now at this point I went
back<00:04:17.840> into<00:04:18.049> pre<00:04:18.410> mask<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.769> all<00:04:18.859> these<00:04:19.010> areas

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
back into pre mask of all these areas

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.069 
back into pre mask of all these areas
here<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.760> white<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.450> reason<00:04:20.660> I've<00:04:20.780> done<00:04:20.930> that

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
here and white the reason I've done that

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.060 
here and white the reason I've done that
is<00:04:21.229> because<00:04:21.410> i'm<00:04:21.470> going<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.650> airbrush<00:04:21.889> down

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
is because i'm going to airbrush down

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.370 
is because i'm going to airbrush down
and<00:04:22.250> plate<00:04:22.400> later<00:04:22.610> in<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.940> project<00:04:23.389> here<00:04:23.780> i'm

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
and plate later in the project here i'm

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.450 
and plate later in the project here i'm
going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.590> start<00:04:24.740> from<00:04:24.889> the<00:04:25.039> front<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
going to start from the front to the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.000 
going to start from the front to the
back<00:04:25.550> doing<00:04:25.910> realistic<00:04:26.450> flames<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:27.620> reason

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
back doing realistic flames the reason

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.350 
back doing realistic flames the reason
that<00:04:28.039> these<00:04:28.280> are<00:04:28.460> masked<00:04:28.789> off<00:04:28.910> because<00:04:29.240> i'm

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
that these are masked off because i'm

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.939 
that these are masked off because i'm
going<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.539> use<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.660> candy<00:04:30.080> died<00:04:30.229> when<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
going to use a candy died when the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.219 
going to use a candy died when the
candied<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.370> goes<00:04:31.610> back<00:04:31.789> through<00:04:32.120> if<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.570> mask

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
candied I goes back through if you mask

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.080 
candied I goes back through if you mask
your<00:04:33.410> area<00:04:33.740> off<00:04:33.889> afterwards<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.820> put<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
your area off afterwards and put the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.570 
your area off afterwards and put the
diamond<00:04:35.300> plate<00:04:35.539> on<00:04:35.660> top<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:37.160> color<00:04:37.370> will

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
diamond plate on top the color will

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.430 
diamond plate on top the color will
bleed<00:04:37.820> back<00:04:38.030> through<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.539> don't<00:04:38.990> want<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.169> to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
bleed back through I don't want that to

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.510 
bleed back through I don't want that to
happen<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.770> I'll<00:04:40.070> go<00:04:40.190> ahead<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.370> ask

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
happen so I'll go ahead and ask

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.830 
happen so I'll go ahead and ask
everything<00:04:40.880> off<00:04:41.000> at<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.270> point

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.620 

my<00:04:49.840> slouch<00:04:50.139> wife<00:04:50.919> says<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.280> slouch<00:04:51.550> we're<00:04:52.540> gonna

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
and then on some of the hot spots back

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.420 
and then on some of the hot spots back
and<00:05:07.870> forth<00:05:08.050> throughout<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.560> flame<00:05:09.160> I'll

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
and forth throughout the flame I'll

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.250 
and forth throughout the flame I'll
widen<00:05:09.730> my<00:05:09.760> hands<00:05:10.030> start<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:13.080> getting<00:05:14.080> ready

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
widen my hands start going getting ready

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.720 
widen my hands start going getting ready
to<00:05:14.380> spray<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.650> realistic<00:05:15.100> flames<00:05:15.340> right<00:05:15.550> now

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
to spray the realistic flames right now

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.490 
to spray the realistic flames right now
a<00:05:15.970> lot<00:05:16.389> of<00:05:16.419> variations<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.260> way<00:05:17.380> of

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
a lot of variations in the way of

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.290 
a lot of variations in the way of
spraying<00:05:17.800> I'm<00:05:18.610> going<00:05:18.790> to<00:05:18.850> spray<00:05:19.120> them<00:05:19.210> a

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
spraying I'm going to spray them a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.640 
spraying I'm going to spray them a
little<00:05:19.419> bit<00:05:19.600> different<00:05:19.900> than<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.080> normally<00:05:20.139> do

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
little bit different than I normally do

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.250 
little bit different than I normally do
but<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:22.180> should<00:05:22.389> see<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.600> lot<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.840> difference

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
but you should see a lot of difference

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.719 
but you should see a lot of difference
in<00:05:23.380> things<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.889> don't<00:05:23.919> know<00:05:24.250> what<00:05:24.430> I'm<00:05:24.520> talking

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
just rattling right now why can't I just

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.719 
just rattling right now why can't I just
say<00:05:29.560> something<00:05:29.620> short<00:05:31.950> how<00:05:32.950> come<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.250> sound<00:05:33.520> so

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729
