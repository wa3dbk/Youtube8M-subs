00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.819 

so<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.870> I'm<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.410> tip<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.740> nose

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
so now I'm going to the tip of the nose

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.590 
so now I'm going to the tip of the nose
I<00:00:02.010> know<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.250> was<00:00:02.370> awful<00:00:02.669> small<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.179> I'm

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I know this was awful small and I'm

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.480 
I know this was awful small and I'm
gonna<00:00:03.720> go<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.170> dot<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.920> up<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.279> it's

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
gonna go to that dot that is up on it's

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.990 
gonna go to that dot that is up on it's
on<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.029> top<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.420> its<00:00:06.569> fin<00:00:06.950> and<00:00:07.950> I'm<00:00:08.309> now<00:00:08.639> going

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
on the top of its fin and I'm now going

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.970 
on the top of its fin and I'm now going
to<00:00:09.389> maintain<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.469> angle<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:12.090> again<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.440> we

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
to maintain that angle and again we we

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
to maintain that angle and again we we
could<00:00:14.130> get<00:00:14.280> away<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.700> some<00:00:15.210> inaccuracy

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
could get away with some inaccuracy

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
could get away with some inaccuracy
but<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.279> decided<00:00:17.640> where<00:00:18.449> I'm<00:00:18.630> gonna

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
but because I decided where I'm gonna

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
but because I decided where I'm gonna
put<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> end<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> nose<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.939> all

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
put the end of the nose now that is all

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.259 
put the end of the nose now that is all
decided<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.619> completely<00:00:23.490> take

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
decided this is going to completely take

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.170 
decided this is going to completely take
away<00:00:24.420> any<00:00:24.949> calculations<00:00:25.949> any<00:00:26.310> measurements

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
away any calculations any measurements

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.109 
away any calculations any measurements
or<00:00:27.300> anything<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.830> need<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.730> match

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
or anything all you need to do is match

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.840 
or anything all you need to do is match
up<00:00:30.179> where<00:00:30.990> angles<00:00:31.650> intersect<00:00:32.130> each<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
up where angles intersect each other and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.790 
up where angles intersect each other and
you're<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.930> off<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> races<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you're going to be off to the races and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040 
you're going to be off to the races and
we<00:00:35.010> don't<00:00:35.190> need<00:00:35.340> too<00:00:35.550> many<00:00:35.760> things<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
we don't need too many things on here to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.180 
we don't need too many things on here to
get<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.440> accurate<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.260> size<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
get a very accurate you know size of the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.910 
get a very accurate you know size of the
fish<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.520> everything<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
fish and everything so now I'm down here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
fish and everything so now I'm down here
on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> end<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> nose<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.570> gonna<00:00:46.020> make

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
on the end of the nose I'm gonna make

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.060 
on the end of the nose I'm gonna make
sure<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:47.629> intersect<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> keep<00:00:49.920> my

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sure I I intersect that and keep my

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
sure I I intersect that and keep my
angle<00:00:50.489> true<00:00:50.789> by<00:00:51.059> making<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.870> paper

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
angle true by making sure that my paper

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
angle true by making sure that my paper
is<00:00:52.579> right<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.620> parallel<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.219> my

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is right there a parallel with my my

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
is right there a parallel with my my
little<00:00:57.149> reference<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.620> gonna<00:00:58.800> come

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
little reference here and I'm gonna come

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.420 
little reference here and I'm gonna come
up<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.670> gonna<00:00:59.820> make<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:01.469> right

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
up here and I'm gonna make this right

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.130 
up here and I'm gonna make this right
there<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.790> an

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
there and so now we have an

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
there and so now we have an
all-important<00:01:08.540> I'll<00:01:09.540> better<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.170> I'm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
all-important I'll better put this I'm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
all-important I'll better put this I'm
going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> circle<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.010> these<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.460> even<00:01:11.790> though

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
going to circle all these do even though

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.160 
going to circle all these do even though
I<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.270> circles<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> they're<00:01:12.900> hard<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I don't want circles and they're hard to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
I don't want circles and they're hard to
get<00:01:13.290> off<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:14.939> want<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> always

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
get off and I don't want you to always

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
get off and I don't want you to always
have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.049> something<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.430> now

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
have to do something like that but now

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
have to do something like that but now
remember<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.110> you've<00:01:19.439> done<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.009> me

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
remember if you've done this with me

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
remember if you've done this with me
before<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
before now I can put this up here and I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
before now I can put this up here and I
can<00:01:22.830> pretty<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.340> decide<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> angles

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
can pretty much decide what the angles

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.179 
can pretty much decide what the angles
going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:28.170> isn't<00:01:28.470> perfectly<00:01:28.770> level

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
going to be it isn't perfectly level

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.789 
going to be it isn't perfectly level
it's<00:01:29.430> already<00:01:29.820> starting<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.299> come<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it's already starting to come down but I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
it's already starting to come down but I
just<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> remind<00:01:32.579> myself<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
just want to remind myself what in the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.800 
just want to remind myself what in the
world<00:01:33.869> am<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:34.229> drawing<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.479> going

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
world am i drawing so now this is going

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
world am i drawing so now this is going
to<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> fish's<00:01:37.470> nose<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:41.009> could<00:01:41.610> even

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to be the fish's nose and I could even

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
to be the fish's nose and I could even
go<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.210> far<00:01:42.420> I've<00:01:42.630> become<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.259> could<00:01:43.560> come<00:01:43.740> in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
go this far I've become I could come in

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
go this far I've become I could come in
here<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> pick<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.899> angle

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
here I'm going to pick out the the angle

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
here I'm going to pick out the the angle
the<00:01:46.860> overall<00:01:47.369> angle<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.299> always

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the overall angle of this I'm always

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.230 
the overall angle of this I'm always
looking<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.079> angles<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.880> wanted<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
looking for angles and if I wanted to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
looking for angles and if I wanted to
know<00:01:51.479> how<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.110> goes<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.829> another

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
know how much this goes in from another

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.730 
know how much this goes in from another
angle<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.670> could<00:01:53.729> go<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.170> later

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
angle I could go from here to here later

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
angle I could go from here to here later
and<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.719> talking

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and see how just like I was talking

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
and see how just like I was talking
about<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.500> fin<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.130> could<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
about with that fin I could see how this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
about with that fin I could see how this
bows<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> straight<00:02:02.430> line<00:02:02.729> through<00:02:03.149> here

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
bows out of a straight line through here

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.219 
bows out of a straight line through here
you<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.530> using<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you know just by using the you know the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.770 
you know just by using the you know the
fact<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.770> I'm<00:02:07.920> gonna<00:02:08.039> pick<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.550> that's

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
fact that I'm gonna pick the one that's

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.059 
fact that I'm gonna pick the one that's
farthest<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.200> way<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> farthest

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
farthest out this way and the farthest

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
farthest out this way and the farthest
out<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.459> way<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.989> would

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
out that way and then just like we would

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.809 
out that way and then just like we would
a<00:02:13.590> grid<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.790> start<00:02:15.660> seeing<00:02:16.230> how<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:17.069> fits<00:02:17.640> in

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
a grid you start seeing how it fits in

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.440 
a grid you start seeing how it fits in
relationship<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.800> squares<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.209> lines

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
relationship to the squares or the lines

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.979 
relationship to the squares or the lines
that<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:21.959> created<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:24.959> go

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that you have created so there we go

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.650 
that you have created so there we go
with<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.590> let's<00:02:26.340> go<00:02:26.550> ahead<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.150> come<00:02:27.630> up

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
with that one let's go ahead and come up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.589 
with that one let's go ahead and come up
with<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.770> angle<00:02:29.280> we'll<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
with this angle we'll go from here to

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.830 
with this angle we'll go from here to
there<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> find<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.590> where<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.519> is

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
there I want to find out where this is

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.240 
there I want to find out where this is
and<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.800> now<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.590> maybe<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> go

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and so now you know maybe we have to go

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.729 
and so now you know maybe we have to go
over<00:02:38.519> here<00:02:38.700> let's<00:02:38.910> let's<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.590> could

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
over here let's let's do that we could

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.440 
over here let's let's do that we could
go<00:02:40.830> over<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.099> either<00:02:41.220> side<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.390> to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
go over to either side I just want to

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.449 
go over to either side I just want to
make<00:02:42.540> sure<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.870> guys<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.130> had<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
make sure you guys can see and I had to

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.039 
make sure you guys can see and I had to
make<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.760> small<00:02:45.060> enough<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.540> where<00:02:45.569> we<00:02:45.900> could

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
make this small enough to where we could

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.500 
make this small enough to where we could
fit<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.319> around<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.269> go<00:02:48.360> from

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
fit it around but I'm going to go from

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.220 
fit it around but I'm going to go from
the<00:02:48.600> end<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> nose<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:50.150> over<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.480> where<00:02:51.959> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the end of the nose and over to where it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:02.289 
the end of the nose and over to where it
intersects<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.040> line<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.720> bottom

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
intersects that line for my the bottom

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.089 
intersects that line for my the bottom
part<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> head<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> guess<00:03:04.019> also<00:03:04.920> not

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
part of the head I guess also not

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.380 
part of the head I guess also not
wondering<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.580> nowhere<00:03:05.849> what<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.030> call<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
wondering what nowhere what I call that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.610 
wondering what nowhere what I call that
okay<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.380> we're<00:03:07.739> gonna<00:03:07.890> go<00:03:08.130> from<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.620> here

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
okay so we're gonna go from the and here

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.820 
okay so we're gonna go from the and here
is<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.160> bottom<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.000> fish<00:03:12.239> okay<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.080> now

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
is the bottom of the fish okay so now

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.830 
is the bottom of the fish okay so now
well<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> already<00:03:14.549> I'm<00:03:14.970> already<00:03:15.390> starting<00:03:15.720> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
well I already I'm already starting to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.349 
well I already I'm already starting to
get<00:03:15.989> some<00:03:16.170> pretty<00:03:16.319> cool<00:03:16.620> ideas<00:03:16.940> about<00:03:17.940> you

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
get some pretty cool ideas about you

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.009 
get some pretty cool ideas about you
know<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.739> able<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
know what I want to be able to do and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.770 
know what I want to be able to do and
maybe<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.739> come<00:03:22.980> back<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.269> I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
maybe I can come back with this and I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.720 
maybe I can come back with this and I
could<00:03:24.959> find<00:03:25.230> out<00:03:25.440> where<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.070> how<00:03:26.130> long<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
could find out where and how long the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.910 
could find out where and how long the
mouth<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.690> maybe<00:03:27.840> I'll<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:28.109> freehand<00:03:28.560> it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
mouth is but maybe I'll just freehand it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.890 
mouth is but maybe I'll just freehand it
in<00:03:29.040> there<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.430> get<00:03:29.549> an<00:03:29.640> idea<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.750> as

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
in there and get an idea and then as

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.229 
in there and get an idea and then as
soon<00:03:31.109> as<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.650> I'll<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.430> an<00:03:32.790> idea

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
soon as I do that I'll have an idea

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.630 
soon as I do that I'll have an idea
later<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.200> where<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.069> want<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> change

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
later of where I want to change

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.099 
later of where I want to change
something<00:03:35.880> because<00:03:36.090> maybe<00:03:36.359> my<00:03:36.660> decision

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
something because maybe my decision

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.069 
something because maybe my decision
wasn't<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.530> great<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.569> create<00:03:42.810> this

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
wasn't so great and I can create this

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.500 
wasn't so great and I can create this
angle<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.769> have<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.299> let's<00:03:45.299> go<00:03:45.480> ahead

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
angle that I have in here let's go ahead

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.599 
angle that I have in here let's go ahead
and<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.049> do<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:47.280> looks<00:03:47.489> like

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
and just do that so we can it looks like

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.110 
and just do that so we can it looks like
it's<00:03:47.790> pretty<00:03:47.970> straight<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.220> I'm<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
it's pretty straight and so I'm going to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.759 
it's pretty straight and so I'm going to
go<00:03:51.269> ahead<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.750> use<00:03:51.989> either<00:03:52.139> side<00:03:52.470> for

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
go ahead and you can use either side for

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.870 
go ahead and you can use either side for
something<00:03:53.069> like<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.549> use<00:03:53.579> either

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
something like this you can use either

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.129 
something like this you can use either
