00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.600
 today we can say that this cup 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.490
 de France and represents a dream 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.229
 as we are super it is superb 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.979
 all the more confronted with 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.539
 professionals and even more so a 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.280
 mythical club like the ace saint-etienne 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.280
 with all its history that we know 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.250
 not a lot of videos from 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.960
 reportage in the sense that we have a lot of 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.369
 people who have come to immortalize moment 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 but after we learn in terms of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.409
 memories - I have blues and my role 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 schedule the jerseys the companies I 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.680
 I'll try to share it with my 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.930
 family will be for them but me the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.979
 memories jaurès and 90 me that I would have 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.979
 asked no 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 for example, even 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.510
 I could watch a foot 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.680
 who concludes all of this because I 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.280
 think it would be good to present to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.280
 my children 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.840

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.980

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.120
 do not know it's not part of my 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.990
 daily so it'll go quickly so we 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.570
 take maximum advantage 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.230
 so we savor and that is happiness 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.680
 is that you want to ask that it lasts 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.650
