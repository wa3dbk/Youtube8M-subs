our cheeks now when you first do that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
our cheeks now when you first do that
you<00:01:56.939> might<00:01:57.149> find<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> colorless<00:01:58.110> looks

a little bit too intense but not a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
a little bit too intense but not a
problem<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.280> as

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
problem because we can back out and as

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
problem because we can back out and as
this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> its<00:02:03.420> own<00:02:03.540> layer<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.409> then

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this is on its own layer we can then

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
this is on its own layer we can then

come over to the layers panel and reduce

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
come over to the layers panel and reduce
their<00:02:06.810> pasty<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.890> were<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
their pasty if they make were just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.369 
their pasty if they make were just
applied<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.599> take<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.780> down<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.110> zero

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
applied so we can take it down to zero

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960 
applied so we can take it down to zero
when<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.770> don't<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.039> any<00:02:11.160> makeup<00:02:11.340> applied<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
when we don't see any makeup applied a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.740 
when we don't see any makeup applied a
hundred<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.500> so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
hundred we see all of it so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
hundred we see all of it so
somewhere<00:02:14.140> again<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.590> between<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.520> I'm

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
somewhere again in between and I'm

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.190 
somewhere again in between and I'm
probably<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.240> go<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.630> around<00:02:16.960> about

probably going to go for around about

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
probably going to go for around about
fifty<00:02:18.130> percent<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.130> go<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
fifty percent so there we go that's the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.210 
fifty percent so there we go that's the
makeup<00:02:22.450> applied<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.680> flatten<00:02:24.190> that

makeup applied now and flatten that
layer<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:26.380> all<00:02:26.770> we're<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> do<00:02:27.250> to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
layer and then all we're going to do to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.120 
layer and then all we're going to do to
enhance<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.180> length<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.020> models<00:02:29.350> neck<00:02:29.770> is
