00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 super smash bros game announced in the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.809
 e3 of 2013 megaman rosarina little mac and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 other company they light the powder of the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 emotion and the ipe of going back to see a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.470
 new delivery of the well-known 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.779
 nintendo franchise but after its 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 ad there is something that always disturbed me 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 something that at first sight can be seen 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.740
 as a good opportunity but on the other 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 side can end up being a great 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.970
 disadvantage to what I mean with this is 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.070
 simple and based on this question is 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.500
 super smash bros for 3ds a good idea 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.989
 a few days ago I was interested 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.510
 asking for opinions about what they thought 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.600
 of the 3ds version of super smash bros 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.010
 the result is that they have two points 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 of view that more than one has been able 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.500
 hit with him as far as opinion is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.019
 refers on the one hand more than one sees good 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 this opportunity but the other one seems 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.030
 an inconvenience and I will tell you why 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.729
 before continuing we are going to take two 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.759
 different points of view on the one hand 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.530
 we'll see the point of view of a fan and 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.259
 on the other the point of view of 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.350
 nintendo and both will have advantages and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.970
 disadvantages so let's start 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 advantage funk point of view 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 obviously as a fan more than one would use the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.450
 argument that it would be great to be able to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.330
 take the battles of super smash bros 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.729
 everywhere you needed a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.040
 delivery on the laptop and that obviously 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.680
 unlike the version of will you 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.899
 this would not be a port simply 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 that would be a very different version for 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.580
 which would make it more attractive that without 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.159
 tell you that you would gain much more 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.380
 catalog that is already extensive that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.710
 has the 3ds which would make it a 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 console much more attractive but what is 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.539
 its disadvantage from the point of view of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.550
 a fan many would say that they should not 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.490
 there are disadvantages and that only 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.060
 It would be a unique opportunity but that's not 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.970
 it's completely true think in a minute 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.299
 which version will be more complete that of 3ds 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.459
 or the one of wild obviously we go to the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.340
 of wii u not just because it's more powerful 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.260
 not because it's hd but because the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 development will have more experience in 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.460
 desktop console that on laptop 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.010
 besides that it would be easier 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.610
 an evolution of will a will you that a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 evolution of will to 3ds going to the case 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 we realize that the 3ds version 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.590
 is not just a port and not be so 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.420
 means that resources are used 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.220
 times and additional jobs that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.620
 could accelerate the production of the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.200
 version of wii u that we could already be 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.020
 enjoying or at least having a date 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.240
 more concrete that without counting that 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.610
 we would be more relieved to know that 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.770
 nintendo would be totally focused 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 in giving all the priority and quality to 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.700
 super smash bros the wild instead of 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.270
 be working in two versions 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.670
 different that is the look that maybe 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.310
 a fan would be premeditating in this 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.680
 moment 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.500
 now let's go to the point of view of 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.290
 Nintendo many will say that Nintendo 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.170
 I would be doing that to get the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.720
 maximum benefit to the franchise the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.590
 question is what is he really doing 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.200
 it's a good move or he's wrong we're going 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.200
 for the advantages first of all 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.930
 nintendo would obviously be pulling out a 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.610
 additional benefit in the franchise 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.459
 something he had not done on consoles 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.190
 laptops besides that would be 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.370
 making the catalog even more attractive and 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.920
 the option to buy a 3ds and finally 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 I would be giving the possibility that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.690
 new deliveries of the franchise 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.989
 they will reach the laptops but and their 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.849
 disadvantage then what is here where 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.849
 the situation starts to become a 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.980
 little bit blacker first of all 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.630
 Nintendo must cover the time expense 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.390
 and development that leads to doing both 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.580
 versions since today we do not know 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.250
 if they will go to the same date or it will be like 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.739
 the franchise mario kart besides that 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.090
 Nintendo must also establish a 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.430
 playability that is 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.560
 commanding 3ds because it's worth the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.990
 redundancy you know that sometimes 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.260
 the battles become chaotic and the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.210
 movements of the fingers also other 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.660
 the issue will be the online service 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.810
 will be well implemented in wii i what 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.570
 I believe in 3ds I dare not insure it and 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.850
 I can be wrong but remember that 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.830
 smash bros just released in a 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.470
 portable by which you must adapt 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.690
 not only the gameplay and other factors 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.479
 of the game but also its component 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.880
 online because even if one does not say so 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.130
 you want a smash bros that has a 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.430
 online service something stronger than 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.560
 wil did not do well and finally and 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.240
 maybe the one who was nintendo the most 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.550
 to care is that it takes away the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.280
 exclusivity to wow 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.560
 let's accept it will you expect smash bros 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.410
 like a strong dish to be a sells 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.229
 consoles now with a version of 3ds 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.449
 the sales will be as good as 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.360
 It is likely that having a greater number of 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.300
 3ds users that from wiiu most 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.020
 Choose to take 3ds and I would not buy 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.349
 the console 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.039
 on a table something that simply will 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.900
 you already nintendo is left of the kick 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.599
 many will say that a console could not 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.840
 take off with a single game but mario 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.659
 kart 7 could take off 3ds and nintendogs 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.509
 could take off nintendo ds over there in 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.990
 2004 because I could not do it smash bros 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.240
 for wii the problem now would not be the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.819
 competition but the version itself of 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.550
 nintendo 3ds that would take away the 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:59.150
 exclusivity to will of one of the sells 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.490
 most popular consoles in the industry 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.700
 and what do you think about the version of 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.670
 nintendo 3ds of super smash bros is 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.889
 good idea or a disadvantage leave your 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.740
 opinion in the comment box 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.289
 in short that has been everything maybe they had 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.499
 more topics to deepen but they are 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.289
 I will leave you to comment with 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:26.419
 I send you a greeting 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.419
 good luck and see you in another video bye bye
