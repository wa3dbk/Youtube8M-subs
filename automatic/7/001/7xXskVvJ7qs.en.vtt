a<00:01:04.739> few<00:01:04.830> people<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.489> afford<00:01:05.760> evo<00:01:05.970> still

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
a few people so they afford evo still

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
a few people so they afford evo still

there's<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.620> whole<00:02:16.830> forest<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.400> raining

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
there's this whole forest of raining

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.730 
there's this whole forest of raining
SSDs<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.420> pretty<00:02:18.630> cool<00:02:18.780> too<00:02:18.990> right<00:02:19.200> but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
SSDs that's pretty cool too right but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.930 
SSDs that's pretty cool too right but
often<00:02:19.890> when<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.190> comes<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:20.850> you're

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
often when it comes down to when you're

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.580 
often when it comes down to when you're
talking<00:02:21.150> about<00:02:21.240> an<00:02:21.390> SSD<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.900> performance<00:02:22.440> so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
talking about an SSD is performance so

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.990 
talking about an SSD is performance so
taking<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.100> look<00:02:23.250> right<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.459> they're<00:02:23.850> just

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
taking a look right here they're just

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.720 
taking a look right here they're just

running some basic crystal this mark

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.120 
running some basic crystal this mark
runs<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.420> might<00:02:27.870> notice<00:02:28.080> not<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> huge

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
jump in performance that's because these

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.890 
jump in performance that's because these

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.610 
per second for rights we're also seeing
similar<00:02:45.180> 4k<00:02:45.690> numbers<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.230> you're<00:02:46.350> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> be

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
similar 4k numbers so you're going to be

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410 
similar 4k numbers so you're going to be
able<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:47.040> anywhere<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:47.940> 80<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.270> a

able to see anywhere from 80 to a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.760 
able to see anywhere from 80 to a
hundred<00:02:48.510> thousand<00:02:49.110> input/output<00:02:49.709> operations

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
hundred thousand input/output operations

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.830 
hundred thousand input/output operations
per<00:02:50.370> second<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:51.209> you're<00:02:51.330> talking<00:02:51.660> about

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
per second when you're talking about

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.470 
per second when you're talking about
typical<00:02:52.560> workloads<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.130> stress<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.790> SSD<00:02:54.300> in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
typical workloads that stress the SSD in

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.410 
typical workloads that stress the SSD in
that<00:02:54.690> way<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.130> major<00:02:56.640> benefit<00:02:57.300> of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that way so what is the major benefit of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.960 
that way so what is the major benefit of
the<00:02:57.480> 850<00:02:57.989> pro<00:02:58.290> well<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.130> comes<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> NAND

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the 850 pro well it comes from the NAND

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.150 
the 850 pro well it comes from the NAND
so<00:03:00.510> here's<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> really<00:03:00.989> basic<00:03:01.350> diagram<00:03:01.920> of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
so here's a really basic diagram of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.270 
so here's a really basic diagram of
their<00:03:02.340> 3d<00:03:02.910> v-nand<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.050> noon<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.650> flash<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
their 3d v-nand so noon and flash and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.890 
their 3d v-nand so noon and flash and
basically<00:03:05.580> they're<00:03:05.970> building<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.450> vertically

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
basically they're building it vertically

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.620 
basically they're building it vertically
rather<00:03:07.019> than<00:03:07.590> horizontally<00:03:08.519> which<00:03:09.000> means<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
rather than horizontally which means a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.880 
rather than horizontally which means a
few<00:03:09.780> different<00:03:10.050> things<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.440> means<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:10.709> can

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
few different things it means they can

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.009 
few different things it means they can
get<00:03:11.010> more<00:03:11.220> better<00:03:11.640> density<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.600> actually<00:03:12.900> one

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
get more better density but actually one

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.930 
get more better density but actually one
of<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> huge<00:03:13.440> benefits<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.430> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
of the huge benefits of this is that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.360 
of the huge benefits of this is that
they<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.600> much<00:03:15.870> greater

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
they actually have much greater

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.430 
they actually have much greater
durability<00:03:17.370> as<00:03:18.090> well<00:03:18.600> as<00:03:18.810> enhanced

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
durability as well as enhanced

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.199 
durability as well as enhanced
performance<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:20.519> that's<00:03:20.730> going<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.940> lead<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
performance now that's going to lead to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.060 
performance now that's going to lead to
a<00:03:21.390> few<00:03:21.660> different<00:03:21.989> things<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
a few different things here the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.800 
a few different things here the
durability<00:03:23.430> factor<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.180> actually<00:03:24.570> about

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
durability factor is actually about

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.870 
durability factor is actually about
double<00:03:25.320> from<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.799> typical<00:03:26.070> man<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.760> we've

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880

10,000 program erase cycles and that's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.190 
10,000 program erase cycles and that's
that's<00:04:13.950> an<00:04:14.220> estimate<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:14.940> now<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.329> again

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that's an estimate for now but again

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.990 
that's an estimate for now but again
more<00:04:17.039> than<00:04:17.190> double<00:04:17.370> what<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.729> might<00:04:17.880> expect

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
more than double what you might expect

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.969 
more than double what you might expect
with<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.900> lot<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.289> nand<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:19.680> currently

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
with a lot of the nand that's currently

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.190 
with a lot of the nand that's currently
available<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.760> that's<00:04:21.209> pretty<00:04:21.510> cool<00:04:21.599> but<00:04:22.080> the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
available so that's pretty cool but the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.930 
available so that's pretty cool but the
added<00:04:22.349> speed<00:04:22.710> also<00:04:22.979> gives<00:04:23.280> another<00:04:23.520> benefit

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
added speed also gives another benefit

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.940 
added speed also gives another benefit
so<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> lot<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.599> SSDs<00:04:25.200> when<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.560> go<00:04:25.740> down

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
so with a lot of SSDs when you go down

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.330 
so with a lot of SSDs when you go down
to<00:04:25.979> low

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340

like<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.150> demonstration<00:05:00.570> that<00:05:00.720> they<00:05:00.900> have

like this demonstration that they have
going<00:05:01.169> on<00:05:01.320> here<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.680> also<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:02.010> think<00:05:02.100> is<00:05:02.340> going

to<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.639> a<00:05:02.669> great<00:05:02.850> benefit<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.270> folks<00:05:03.570> who<00:05:03.780> are

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
to be a great benefit to folks who are

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.020 
to be a great benefit to folks who are
