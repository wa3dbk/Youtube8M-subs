threaded<00:00:38.460> cable<00:00:38.879> feels<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.600> gonna

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
threaded cable feels like it's not gonna

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540 
threaded cable feels like it's not gonna
break<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> me<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.370> gonna<00:00:41.460> be

see the HDD 500 gigabytes we'll take a
look<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
look at that in a little bit and of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
look at that in a little bit and of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
instruction manual that again we

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
instruction manual that again we
probably<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.820> take<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> look<00:01:00.270> at

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
probably don't need so take a look at

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.119
