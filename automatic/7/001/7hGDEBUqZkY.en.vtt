00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
all that stuff but the thing is that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.600 
all that stuff but the thing is that
this<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.230> exactly<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.860> same<00:03:44.040> source<00:03:44.370> I've

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
this is exactly the same source I've

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.759

been getting the other images from and I
don't<00:03:46.830> think<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.160> source<00:03:47.400> would<00:03:47.549> let<00:03:47.700> their

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
don't think the source would let their
