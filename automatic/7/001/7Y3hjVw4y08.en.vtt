00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
I knew I had one and so it was just a

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.120 
I knew I had one and so it was just a
feeling<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.790> relief<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:15.259> mean<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:15.890> kind

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
feeling of relief and I mean it's kind

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.090 
feeling of relief and I mean it's kind

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
of a weird deal both fell down and I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.760
