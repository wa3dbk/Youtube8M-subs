00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
everybody how you doing today I wanted

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.160 
everybody how you doing today I wanted
to<00:00:04.830> talk<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.569> cutting<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.630> tree<00:00:06.809> down<00:00:06.840> for

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
to talk about cutting a tree down for

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.990 
to talk about cutting a tree down for
taper<00:00:07.670> this<00:00:08.670> tree<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> trident<00:00:09.570> maple

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
taper this tree is a trident maple

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.700 
taper this tree is a trident maple
usually<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.300> these<00:00:12.510> cuts<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:13.140> a<00:00:13.410> week

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
usually we do these cuts about a week

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.170 
usually we do these cuts about a week
ago<00:00:14.040> or<00:00:14.070> two<00:00:14.309> weeks<00:00:14.340> ago<00:00:14.550> just<00:00:14.849> before<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
ago or two weeks ago just before the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.240 
ago or two weeks ago just before the
sprout<00:00:15.720> and<00:00:15.840> we<00:00:15.900> had<00:00:16.019> a<00:00:16.049> real<00:00:16.230> heavy<00:00:16.439> rain<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
sprout and we had a real heavy rain and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
sprout and we had a real heavy rain and
everything<00:00:17.880> busted<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.840> crazy<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
everything busted out like crazy so we

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.200 
everything busted out like crazy so we
need<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.539> act<00:00:21.990> fast<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.880> starting

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
need to act fast now that it's starting

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.560 
need to act fast now that it's starting
to<00:00:24.980> grow<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.699> gonna<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:26.970> some<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.330> pitch

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to grow you're gonna get some we pitch

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
to grow you're gonna get some we pitch
but<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.020> wait<00:00:28.170> too<00:00:28.350> much<00:00:28.380> longer<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.920> can't

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
but if we wait too much longer you can't

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
but if we wait too much longer you can't
do<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> big<00:00:29.490> cut<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.900> particular

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
do a big cut like this this particular

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.630 
do a big cut like this this particular
tree

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
tree

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.720 
tree
I've<00:00:33.390> had<00:00:33.809> personally<00:00:34.680> since<00:00:35.930> 98<00:00:37.460> grew<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I've had personally since 98 grew it in

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
I've had personally since 98 grew it in
a<00:00:38.850> pot<00:00:39.059> its<00:00:39.210> whole<00:00:39.360> life<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:40.260> why<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
a pot its whole life that's why the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.819 
a pot its whole life that's why the
trunk<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> smaller<00:00:41.840> last<00:00:42.840> year<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.320> did<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
trunk is smaller last year we did in a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.119 
trunk is smaller last year we did in a
protract<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> show<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:46.890> done

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
protract just to show how it was done

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.510 
protract just to show how it was done
but<00:00:47.899> it<00:00:48.899> wasn't<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.290> great<00:00:49.559> tree<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> look

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but it wasn't a great tree if you look

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
but it wasn't a great tree if you look
at<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.540> great<00:00:51.719> base<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.379> no

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
at this it has this great base but no

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
at this it has this great base but no
tapers<00:00:53.149> we<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.450> carved<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.989> down

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
tapers we could have carved this down

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
tapers we could have carved this down
and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.950> grow<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> while<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and then grow it for a while but it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
and then grow it for a while but it
would<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> pot<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:59.610> really

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
would have to go out of a pot to really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.260 
would have to go out of a pot to really
develop<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.270> correctly<00:01:01.879> actually<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> should

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
develop it correctly actually it should

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.349 
develop it correctly actually it should
go<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> larger<00:01:04.140> pot<00:01:04.700> once<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.969> cut<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:06.359 
go into a larger pot once this cut is

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:08.840 
go into a larger pot once this cut is
done<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:06.749> help<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.079> roll<00:01:07.709> over<00:01:08.069> and<00:01:08.279> to<00:01:08.609> grow

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
done to help it roll over and to grow

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
done to help it roll over and to grow
for<00:01:09.509> caper<00:01:09.719> but<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.409> wanted<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.889> show<00:01:11.069> you<00:01:11.100> how

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
for caper but I wanted to show you how

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
for caper but I wanted to show you how
to<00:01:11.399> do<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:13.009> as<00:01:14.009> you're<00:01:14.429> growing<00:01:14.819> most<00:01:15.569> trees

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to do it as you're growing most trees

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.059 
to do it as you're growing most trees
that<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.380> apical<00:01:16.799> e<00:01:16.829> dominant<00:01:17.090> you're<00:01:18.090> always

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
that are apical e dominant you're always

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.539 
that are apical e dominant you're always
growing<00:01:20.069> them<00:01:20.539> to<00:01:21.539> have<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:22.049> tops<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
growing them to have the tops that you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.099 
growing them to have the tops that you
know<00:01:23.789> knowing<00:01:24.209> that<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.450> tops<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
know knowing that the tops are going to

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.569 
know knowing that the tops are going to
thicken<00:01:25.349> up<00:01:25.499> faster<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.219> bottom

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
thicken up faster than the bottom

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.910 
thicken up faster than the bottom
sections<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:28.020> apex<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> they're<00:01:28.740> always

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
sections so the apex is they're always

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.199 
sections so the apex is they're always
going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.249> have<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.670> periodically

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
going to have to be periodically

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.300 
going to have to be periodically
replaced<00:01:30.569> if<00:01:31.319> you're<00:01:31.529> growing<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.889> tree<00:01:32.069> for

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
replaced if you're growing a tree for

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.819 
replaced if you're growing a tree for
caper<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.529> you<00:01:34.529> have<00:01:34.740> no<00:01:34.950> taper<00:01:35.219> here<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
caper and you have no taper here a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.169 
caper and you have no taper here a
couple<00:01:37.829> ways<00:01:37.919> we<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.279> fix<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.819> by<00:01:38.969> having

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
couple ways we can fix that is by having

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.870 
couple ways we can fix that is by having
sacrificial<00:01:39.990> below<00:01:40.349> that<00:01:40.560> line<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.069> grow<00:01:41.279> or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
sacrificial below that line to grow or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.239 
sacrificial below that line to grow or
we<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> cut<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.779> and<00:01:43.079> regrow<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:44.099> a

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
we can cut it back and regrow it I'm a

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.419 
we can cut it back and regrow it I'm a

big fan of real extreme paper especially
I<00:01:47.459> tried<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.880> maples<00:01:48.239> so<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> 5-year

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:50.669 
I tried at maples so I have a 5-year

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:52.159 
I tried at maples so I have a 5-year
plan<00:01:50.819> in<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.209> head<00:01:51.239> and<00:01:51.659> how<00:01:51.749> I'm<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:52.079> make

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
plan in my head and how I'm gonna make

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:54.679 
plan in my head and how I'm gonna make
this<00:01:52.469> into<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.889> a<00:01:53.159> sweet<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.759> tree<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.419> mean

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this into it a sweet little tree I mean

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.550 
this into it a sweet little tree I mean
one<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.229> ways<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.499> going<00:01:55.529> to<00:01:55.679> do<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.099> by

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
one of the ways I'm going to do it is by

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.850 
one of the ways I'm going to do it is by
shortening<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.880> considerably<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
shortening this considerably and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.240 
shortening this considerably and
basically<00:02:01.860> starting<00:02:02.370> from<00:02:02.520> scratch<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:04.250> could

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
basically starting from scratch I could

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.230 
basically starting from scratch I could
earlier<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.120> this<00:02:07.700> piece<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.000> doesn't

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
earlier these this piece but it doesn't

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.180 
earlier these this piece but it doesn't
he's<00:02:09.450> doing<00:02:09.630> earlier<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.040> I<00:02:11.130> do

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
he's doing earlier that well and I do

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.820 
he's doing earlier that well and I do
have<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.540> about<00:02:12.540> five<00:02:12.840> hundred<00:02:13.020> tried<00:02:13.590> it's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
have a about five hundred tried it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
have a about five hundred tried it's
currently<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> shop<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:15.570> not<00:02:15.690> going

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
currently at the shop so I'm not going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.350 
currently at the shop so I'm not going
to<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.350> now<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.240> cut

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to do that right now I'm going to cut

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.320 
to do that right now I'm going to cut
this<00:02:18.510> off<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.900> show<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.260> looks<00:02:19.380> like

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.590 

okay<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.050> if<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.290> cut<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> top<00:02:27.740> off<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.420> is

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
okay so if we cut the top off this is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.220 
okay so if we cut the top off this is
the<00:02:29.750> tree

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
the tree

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.380 
the tree
this<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.770> guy<00:02:30.950> down<00:02:31.130> here<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:32.120> only

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this little guy down here the only

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.890 
this little guy down here the only
reason<00:02:32.720> why<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> did<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> big<00:02:33.470> cut<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:35.300> large<00:02:35.690> on

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
reason why I did a big cut this large on

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.180 
reason why I did a big cut this large on
this<00:02:35.990> China<00:02:36.260> may<00:02:36.440> pose<00:02:36.650> because<00:02:36.860> there's<00:02:37.100> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
this China may pose because there's a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.800 
this China may pose because there's a
little<00:02:37.460> bud<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.850> was<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:38.210> see<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.660> down

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
little bud that was here see it down

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.000 
little bud that was here see it down
there<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:40.160> actually<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.790> cut<00:02:41.600> over<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
there this actually be cut over to the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.590 
there this actually be cut over to the
but<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.550> don't<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> bud<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
but if you don't have a bud on the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.680 
but if you don't have a bud on the
opposite<00:02:44.960> end<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.850> any<00:02:46.850> deciduous<00:02:47.480> tree

sometimes<00:02:48.170> what<00:02:48.290> will<00:02:48.380> happen<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.710> with<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
sometimes what will happen is with the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040 
sometimes what will happen is with the
cut<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:49.220> large<00:02:49.520> it'll<00:02:50.300> die<00:02:50.450> right<00:02:50.690> down<00:02:50.840> into

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
cut this large it'll die right down into

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.700 
cut this large it'll die right down into
the<00:02:51.170> ground<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:53.480> leave<00:02:53.720> make<00:02:54.410> sure<00:02:54.590> that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
the ground so we leave make sure that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.130 
the ground so we leave make sure that
there's<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.950> bud<00:02:55.160> there<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.640> SAP<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.660> continue

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
there's a bud there so SAP can continue

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.050 
there's a bud there so SAP can continue
to<00:02:57.290> flow<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.710> also<00:02:58.100> we<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.760> back

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
to flow and also we can have a back

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.510 
to flow and also we can have a back
ranch<00:02:59.390> or<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> first<00:02:59.960> branch<00:03:00.430> depending<00:03:01.430> on

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
ranch or a first branch depending on

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
where my new front is next I'm going to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.670 
where my new front is next I'm going to
come<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.520> here<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.020> cut<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> then

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
come in here and cut this and then

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.480 
come in here and cut this and then
smooth<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.710> edge<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.940> blade<00:03:12.340> along<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
smooth the edge with the blade along the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.650 
smooth the edge with the blade along the
it<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.730> don't<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.030> jagged<00:03:14.390> edge<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
it so I don't have a jagged edge and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.060 
it so I don't have a jagged edge and
then<00:03:14.750> I'm<00:03:14.870> gonna<00:03:14.990> seal<00:03:15.350> it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
then I'm gonna seal it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.800 
then I'm gonna seal it

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
that's what I did is I cut this with so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.870 
that's what I did is I cut this with so
it<00:03:25.200> has<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> smooth<00:03:25.710> transition<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.760> also

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it has a smooth transition and I also

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.960 
it has a smooth transition and I also
cut<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> edge<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> blade<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.700> we<00:03:29.790> don't

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
cut the edge with the blade so we don't

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.480 
cut the edge with the blade so we don't
have<00:03:30.090> any<00:03:30.240> rough<00:03:30.450> cuts<00:03:31.160> next<00:03:32.160> thing<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.400> gonna

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
have any rough cuts next thing I'm gonna

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.160 
have any rough cuts next thing I'm gonna
do<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.880> seal<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:35.220> some<00:03:35.340> cut<00:03:35.580> paste

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
do is seal it just some cut paste

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.610 
do is seal it just some cut paste
there's<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.230> lot<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.500> different<00:03:39.620> statements

that<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.290> large<00:03:47.070> cut<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.580> this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that a large cut like this

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.550 
that a large cut like this
I<00:03:49.320> hit<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.860> first<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.490> little<00:03:50.700> bit<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.880> Lysol

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
I hit it first a little bit of Lysol

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.670 
I hit it first a little bit of Lysol
water

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.250 
water
50/50<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.940> then<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.270> put<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> cut<00:03:54.840> paste<00:03:55.050> on

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
50/50 and then I put the cut paste on

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.690 
50/50 and then I put the cut paste on
top<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.550> seems<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:58.130> stop<00:03:59.130> any<00:03:59.400> rot

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
top of it it seems to stop any rot

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.470 
top of it it seems to stop any rot
because<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.450> chance<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.160> roll<00:04:02.160> over<00:04:02.580> if<00:04:03.239> this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
because a chance to roll over if this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.030 
because a chance to roll over if this
stops<00:04:03.720> rolling<00:04:03.930> over<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.410> two<00:04:04.590> years

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
stops rolling over in two years

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.410 
stops rolling over in two years
I<00:04:05.250> cut<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.239> again<00:04:07.640> where<00:04:08.640> their<00:04:08.820> cambium<00:04:09.300> is

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
I cut it again where their cambium is

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.190 
I cut it again where their cambium is
