00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
travel thing now I know that it's not a

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.390 
travel thing now I know that it's not a
vacation<00:00:50.020> all<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.590> time<00:00:50.710> because<00:00:51.100> you're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
that's really neat about it it depends

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.760 
that's really neat about it it depends
on<00:01:02.770> whether<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.190> like<00:01:03.430> to<00:01:03.640> be<00:01:03.850> away<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.390> that

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
for a week or two at a time I don't mind

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.880 
for a week or two at a time I don't mind
that<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.080> know<00:01:08.260> nothing's<00:01:08.590> better<00:01:08.770> than

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.730 

breakdowns<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.930> road<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.590> can

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
breakdowns on the road because that can

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.480 
breakdowns on the road because that can
really<00:02:13.860> turn<00:02:14.190> disasters<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.920> their<00:02:16.920> pay<00:02:17.130> is

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
really turn disasters that their pay is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
really turn disasters that their pay is
very<00:02:18.420> compatible<00:02:20.300> safety<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.360> very<00:02:21.510> important

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
very compatible safety is very important

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.470 
very compatible safety is very important
that's<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> reasons<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.060> went
