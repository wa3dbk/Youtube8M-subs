00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.950
 where you have seen a curve that takes more than 300 kilometers per hour and in the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.950
 that the brake is never touched 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.480
 there is only one and it is in spain horus red water there is no other curve equal in the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.150
 world 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 the circuit has undergone numerous modifications over the years 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.909
 but curiously this area has never been touched 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:27.390
 pay attention to this image is from the 50s and how you see the line is the 

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:28.810
 same as the current 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.490
 Logically, security measures have been increased and it is now impossible to see 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 someone on the runway when the cars are running 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.490
 the pilots fear and adore her is a cluster of opposite feelings fear 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.400
 overwhelm pleasure 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.980
 not everything is able to keep your foot on the table although since you run 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.280
 with the v8 it's easier 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 By the way you can see that he always wanted to get through but his right foot was never 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.100
 I left him 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.410
 the complete sequence of eyes is incredible extends to the valley 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.270
 more than 310 kilometers per hour a descent with 18 meters of difference in 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.910
 just 100 meters 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.490
 the comeback is still more radical the climb has 25 meters of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.500
 a 13% ramp is a vertical wall of 70 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.480
 in this vertiginous ascent the pilots only see the sky and the exit of the 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 third long tradition curve 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.710
 a triple seventh-speed curve 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.850
 and as radical as the pilots suffer lateral forces and also 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 vertical but problem of savings is not the speed nor that three 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 linked curves not even that the entry and exit are empty the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 main problem especially for engineers is brutal change 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.780
 playing with the basses is easy most of the cars leave their 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.180
 traces on the asphalt from the start of the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.750
 until reaching the top the height of the car can vary up to 25 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.040
 millimeters 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.850
 The most surprising thing is that despite his story of his legend and his 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.150
 accidents his name is due to this stream that crosses it underneath a 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.040
 small stream whose bed has a type of sand 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.560
 retains reddish water
