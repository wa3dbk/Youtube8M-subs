00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:25.630 
know this is for two I'd like him to get
the<00:05:14.850> two-seater

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.310 

let<00:05:26.640> me<00:05:26.730> hear<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:26.970> hissing<00:05:27.120> people<00:05:27.570> he<00:05:28.170> just

that jeweled ed box so I just scraped
out<00:05:51.090> or<00:05:51.270> silicon<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.810> was<00:05:51.990> there<00:05:52.260> now<00:05:52.530> let's

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
out or silicon the was there now let's

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.460 
out or silicon the was there now let's
see<00:05:52.980> really<00:05:53.640> look<00:05:53.790> at<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:56.210> okay<00:05:57.260> as<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.410> can

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
see really look at this okay as you can

see really look at this okay as you can
see<00:05:58.590> all<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.580> glue<00:05:59.940> in<00:06:00.090> silicon<00:06:00.540> is<00:06:00.660> just

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
see all the glue in silicon is just

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.650 
see all the glue in silicon is just
fucked<00:06:01.320> or<00:06:01.890> not<00:06:02.100> just<00:06:02.280> just<00:06:02.520> broken<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.390> seal

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
and now we're going to glue a piece of

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.690 
and now we're going to glue a piece of
MDF<00:06:07.350> on<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.650> bottom<00:06:07.920> here<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.340> we<00:06:08.460> flush

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
MDF on the bottom here that we flush

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.210 
MDF on the bottom here that we flush
against<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.510> then<00:06:10.440> we'll<00:06:10.590> recently<00:06:11.070> can

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
against that and then we'll recently can

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.280 
against that and then we'll recently can
it<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.490> then<00:06:11.730> it<00:06:11.850> be<00:06:11.940> it<00:06:12.120> and<00:06:12.510> Liam<00:06:12.900> by<00:06:13.050> ona

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
it and then it be it and Liam by ona

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.870 
it and then it be it and Liam by ona
standing<00:06:13.620> there<00:06:13.740> watching<00:06:13.920> okay<00:06:14.610> there<00:06:14.760> we<00:06:14.790> go

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
standing there watching okay there we go

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.850 
standing there watching okay there we go
so<00:06:15.300> what<00:06:15.480> I<00:06:15.510> did<00:06:15.690> is<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.840> glued<00:06:16.140> a<00:06:16.170> piece<00:06:16.260> of<00:06:16.410> MDF

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
so what I did is a glued a piece of MDF

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.980 
so what I did is a glued a piece of MDF
to<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.100> bottom<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.550> that's<00:06:18.420> glued<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.870> the

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
to the bottom and that's glued to the

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.760 
to the bottom and that's glued to the
side<00:06:19.430> okay<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:21.060> now<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.990> won't<00:06:22.200> flex<00:06:22.440> if<00:06:22.680> you're

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
side okay so now it won't flex if you're

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.840 
side okay so now it won't flex if you're
not<00:06:22.860> i<00:06:22.920> mean<00:06:22.980> because<00:06:23.280> they<00:06:23.370> were<00:06:23.460> actually<00:06:23.640> to

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
not i mean because they were actually to

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.340 
not i mean because they were actually to
have<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.120> move<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:24.480> which<00:06:24.690> is<00:06:24.720> glued<00:06:25.110> and

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
have to move that which is glued and

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.160 
have to move that which is glued and
then<00:06:25.590> silicon<00:06:26.070> around<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:26.940> edges<00:06:27.170> so

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
then silicon around the edges so

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.570 
then silicon around the edges so
hopefully<00:06:28.470> they'll<00:06:28.830> though<00:06:28.980> is<00:06:29.100> also<00:06:29.400> looking

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
hopefully they'll though is also looking

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.130 
hopefully they'll though is also looking
back<00:06:29.820> to<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.060> corner<00:06:30.420> in<00:06:30.660> there<00:06:30.960> and

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
back to the corner in there and

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.170 
back to the corner in there and
everything<00:06:31.290> I've<00:06:32.190> just<00:06:32.220> got<00:06:32.520> that's<00:06:32.700> in<00:06:33.000> there

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
everything I've just got that's in there

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.630 
everything I've just got that's in there
was<00:06:33.360> just<00:06:33.510> keeping<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:33.900> capable<00:06:34.890> straight<00:06:35.220> so

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
was just keeping it capable straight so

00:06:35.640 --> 00:07:49.600 
was just keeping it capable straight so
that<00:06:35.850> should<00:06:36.360> work

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.669 

you
