00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
like i see how it holds up because you

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.879 
like i see how it holds up because you
know<00:03:36.359> straight<00:03:36.659> hair<00:03:36.870> tangle<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.739> crap

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
know straight hair tangle in and crap

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.039 
know straight hair tangle in and crap
like<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:38.489> we'll<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.239> how<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.389> this

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
like that so we'll see how this this

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.740 
like that so we'll see how this this
stuff<00:03:40.260> works<00:03:40.440> out<00:03:40.650> once<00:03:40.949> it<00:03:41.099> gets<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:42.000> flat<00:03:42.629> iron

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
stuff works out once it gets a flat iron

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.189 
stuff works out once it gets a flat iron
straight<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.760> again<00:03:44.849> it's<00:03:45.659> holding<00:03:46.079> up

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
straight but again it's holding up

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.259 
straight but again it's holding up
pretty<00:03:46.379> good<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.459> guys<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.849> kind<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.090> see

issues with it so far minimal shedding

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.520 
issues with it so far minimal shedding
you<00:03:59.940> know<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> wash<00:04:00.540> my<00:04:00.780> hair<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.229> kind

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
of go through it maybe get about seven

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.009 
of go through it maybe get about seven
strands<00:04:04.979> of<00:04:05.370> hair<00:04:05.430> not<00:04:06.150> much<00:04:06.419> reading<00:04:06.629> at<00:04:06.840> all

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
strands of hair not much reading at all

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.080 
strands of hair not much reading at all
I'm<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:08.129> really<00:04:08.310> impressed<00:04:08.459> with<00:04:08.970> how

I'm really really impressed with how

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.149 
I'm really really impressed with how
it's<00:04:09.269> holding<00:04:09.389> up<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.620> know<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.949> put

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159

really<00:04:14.159> good<00:04:14.900> trials<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.380> go<00:04:16.500> through<00:04:16.829> so

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
really good trials to go through so

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.289 
really good trials to go through so
again<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.479> guys<00:04:18.599> have<00:04:18.840> any<00:04:18.930> class

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
again if you guys have any class

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.200 
again if you guys have any class
just<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.079> brief<00:04:20.259> update<00:04:20.639> about<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.970> head<00:04:22.180> out

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
just a brief update about to head out

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.809 
just a brief update about to head out
right<00:04:22.539> now<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:24.520> thought<00:04:24.639> I'd<00:04:24.699> give

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:24.819 
right now and so I just thought I'd give

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.279 
right now and so I just thought I'd give
you<00:04:24.970> guys<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> brief<00:04:25.449> update<00:04:25.599> and<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.020> really

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
you guys a brief update and it's really

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.260 
you guys a brief update and it's really
warm<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:27.099> actually<00:04:27.400> not<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.580> hot<00:04:27.970> here

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
warm it's actually not that hot here

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.659 
warm it's actually not that hot here
right<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.199> moment<00:04:29.470> but<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.099> going<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.580> get

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
right this moment but it's going to get

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.240 
right this moment but it's going to get
really<00:04:30.729> warm<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:32.020> we'll<00:04:32.440> see<00:04:32.620> how<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.800> holds<00:04:33.039> up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
really warm so we'll see how it holds up

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.920 
really warm so we'll see how it holds up
in<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:33.819> probably<00:04:34.030> better<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.449> because<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
in and it's probably better to because I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.749 
in and it's probably better to because I
don't<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.199> any<00:04:35.440> glue<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.770> my<00:04:35.800> hair<00:04:36.099> so<00:04:36.370> I

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
don't have any glue in my hair so I

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.270 
don't have any glue in my hair so I
really<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.210> worry<00:04:37.479> about<00:04:37.629> it<00:04:38.280> doing

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
really have to worry about it doing

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.710 
really have to worry about it doing
anything<00:04:39.610> because<00:04:40.030> there's<00:04:40.150> no<00:04:40.300> glue<00:04:40.509> in<00:04:40.629> it

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
anything because there's no glue in it

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.629 
anything because there's no glue in it
at<00:04:40.840> all<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.500> those<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.009> really<00:04:42.310> don't<00:04:42.490> want

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
at all so those of you really don't want

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.430 
at all so those of you really don't want
to<00:04:42.729> wear<00:04:42.849> glue<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.330> guess<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.930> don't<00:04:44.110> have<00:04:44.169> to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
to wear glue I guess you don't have to

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.869 
to wear glue I guess you don't have to
have<00:04:44.560> always<00:04:44.860> been<00:04:44.979> against<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.669> guess

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
have always been against it but I guess

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.790 
have always been against it but I guess
you<00:04:46.000> don't<00:04:46.150> have<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.449> if<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.569> do<00:04:46.870> something

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
you don't have to if you do something

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.499 
you don't have to if you do something
like<00:04:47.889> this<00:04:48.159> where<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.550> really<00:04:48.729> doesn't<00:04:49.360> matter

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
like this where it really doesn't matter

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.480 
like this where it really doesn't matter
because<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.110> can't<00:04:50.440> see<00:04:50.889> it<00:04:51.069> and<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.310> won't

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
because you can't see it and it won't

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.399 
because you can't see it and it won't
like<00:04:51.729> mom<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.389> worry<00:04:52.509> about<00:04:52.629> it<00:04:52.810> flipping<00:04:53.229> up

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
like mom to worry about it flipping up

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.709 
like mom to worry about it flipping up
or<00:04:53.710> any<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.030> way<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.599> know

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
just the way that it's on there and it's

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.379 
just the way that it's on there and it's
styled<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.080> that's<00:04:59.259> it<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.669> end<00:05:00.699> of<00:05:00.969> our<00:05:01.060> you
