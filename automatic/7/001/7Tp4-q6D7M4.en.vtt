going<00:00:44.340> into<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.820> freshman<00:00:44.969> year<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> college<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
going into my freshman year of college I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
going into my freshman year of college I
cannot<00:00:46.200> afford<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.129> just
