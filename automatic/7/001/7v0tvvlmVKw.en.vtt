so to demonstrate the hierarchical
navigation<00:00:16.330> pattern<00:00:17.050> I'm<00:00:17.890> going<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.279> use

template<00:00:26.739> here<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:29.140> just<00:00:29.290> going<00:00:29.469> to<00:00:29.500> name

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
template here I'm just going to name

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:35.520 
template here I'm just going to name
this<00:00:30.210> hub<00:00:31.210> example<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:35.230> this<00:00:35.410> particular

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
this hub example now this particular

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.709 
this hub example now this particular
template<00:00:36.250> will<00:00:36.460> give<00:00:36.670> us<00:00:36.820> are<00:00:36.969> three<00:00:37.480> levels

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
template will give us are three levels

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.160 
template will give us are three levels
of<00:00:37.989> hierarchy<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.059> just<00:00:40.390> let<00:00:40.570> visual<00:00:40.870> studio

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
of hierarchy so I just let visual studio

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.729 
of hierarchy so I just let visual studio
do<00:00:41.320> its<00:00:41.440> thing<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:43.270> we<00:00:43.360> go<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.840> I'm<00:00:44.710> just

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
do its thing there we go and I'm just

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.450 
do its thing there we go and I'm just
going<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.010> run<00:00:45.190> this<00:00:45.309> straight<00:00:45.579> away

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.260 

so<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.020> app<00:00:52.140> launches<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.860> takes<00:00:53.370> us<00:00:53.580> to<00:00:53.970> our

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so the app launches and takes us to our

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.890 
so the app launches and takes us to our
hub<00:00:54.600> page<00:00:55.820> now<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:56.970> we<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.240> see<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.420> hub<00:00:57.660> page

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
hub page now as we can see our hub page

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.960 
hub page now as we can see our hub page
is<00:00:58.230> divided<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.370> number<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.700> groups

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
is divided into a number of groups

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.060 
is divided into a number of groups
without<00:01:00.690> group<00:01:01.110> 1<00:01:01.440> group<00:01:01.710> 2<00:01:02.280> group<00:01:02.940> 3<00:01:03.300> etc<00:01:03.960> etc

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
without group 1 group 2 group 3 etc etc

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
without group 1 group 2 group 3 etc etc
and<00:01:05.270> at<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> minute<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.690> template<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and at the minute the template just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
and at the minute the template just
displays<00:01:07.950> different<00:01:08.370> colored<00:01:08.840> grayscale

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
displays different colored grayscale

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
displays different colored grayscale
boxes<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> real<00:01:11.670> app<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.330> some

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
boxes but a real app would have some

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
boxes but a real app would have some
really<00:01:12.930> nice<00:01:13.080> graphics<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> try<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really nice graphics here to try and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.890 
really nice graphics here to try and
draw<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> user<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:16.880> if<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.210> select<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
draw the user in if I select one of

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.060 
draw the user in if I select one of
these<00:01:19.080> groups<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.380> taken<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
these groups now we are taken to the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.109 
these groups now we are taken to the
section<00:01:23.759> page<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.220> section<00:01:26.550> page<00:01:26.759> gives

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
section page so the section page gives

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.730 
section page so the section page gives
us<00:01:27.300> an<00:01:27.390> overview<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.050> this<00:01:28.229> section<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.729 

the<00:02:14.760> easiest<00:02:15.239> way<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.510> demonstrate<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.349> flat

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
the easiest way to demonstrate the flat

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.920 
the easiest way to demonstrate the flat
navigation<00:02:17.340> style<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.239> use<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.629> non

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
navigation style is to use the non

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.229 
navigation style is to use the non
desktop<00:02:19.349> version<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.980> Internet<00:02:20.760> Explorer

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
desktop version of Internet Explorer

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.820 
desktop version of Internet Explorer
that<00:02:21.569> comes<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.290> Windows<00:02:22.709> 8<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.709> we

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that comes with Windows 8 so if we

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.949 
that comes with Windows 8 so if we
right-click<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:27.239> we<00:02:27.420> were<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> touch

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
right-click or if we were on a touch

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.080 
right-click or if we were on a touch
device<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.560> would<00:02:28.739> swipe<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.400> from<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.730> top

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
device we would swipe down from the top

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.589 
device we would swipe down from the top
or<00:02:30.360> swipe<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.019> from<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.260> bottom<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:33.360> got<00:02:33.480> our

or swipe up from the bottom we got our

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.729 
or swipe up from the bottom we got our

using<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> plus<00:02:41.280> button<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.739> if<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.920> go

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
using the plus button here so if I go

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:51.500 
using the plus button here so if I go
ahead<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.579> quickly<00:02:46.790> load<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> web<00:02:48.090> page<00:02:50.360> now<00:02:51.360> if

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
ahead and quickly load a web page now if

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.240 
ahead and quickly load a web page now if
we<00:02:51.599> go<00:02:51.720> back<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.230> top<00:02:52.560> app<00:02:52.739> bar

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
we go back to the top app bar

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.940 
we go back to the top app bar
notice<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.660> representation<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
notice that the representation of the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.210 
notice that the representation of the
tab<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:57.750> familiar<00:02:58.170> image<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> website

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
tab is a familiar image of the website

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.890 
tab is a familiar image of the website
so<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.700> makes<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.000> really<00:03:00.090> easy<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.540> connect

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
so that makes it really easy to connect

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.550 
so that makes it really easy to connect
the<00:03:00.989> two<00:03:01.140> together<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.780> create<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> new

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the two together if I then create a new

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:16.030 
the two together if I then create a new
tab<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.359> for<00:03:06.359> example<00:03:10.849> open<00:03:11.849> my<00:03:12.150> blog

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.540 

again<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> block<00:03:17.340> loads

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.470 

and<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.720> head<00:03:24.870> back<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.380> top<00:03:25.800> app<00:03:26.010> bar

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
and if we head back to the top app bar

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.280 
and if we head back to the top app bar
will<00:03:27.480> notice<00:03:27.720> again<00:03:27.930> we've<00:03:28.050> got<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
will notice again we've got the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.450 
will notice again we've got the
thumbnail<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.610> add<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.970> new<00:03:30.570> tab<00:03:30.870> and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
thumbnail and we can add a new tab and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.280 
thumbnail and we can add a new tab and
to<00:03:32.460> switch<00:03:32.640> between<00:03:32.820> tabs<00:03:33.270> we<00:03:33.600> open<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.170> app

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
to switch between tabs we open the app

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.670 
to switch between tabs we open the app
bar<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.940> select<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.090> item<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:37.530> that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
bar and select the item so know that

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.100 
bar and select the item so know that
it's<00:03:37.800> pretty<00:03:37.920> quick<00:03:38.220> too<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:39.660> switch<00:03:39.900> between

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
it's pretty quick too to switch between

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's pretty quick too to switch between
pages

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.509 

so<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.349> demonstrate<00:03:47.560> semantic<00:03:48.489> zoom

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
so we can demonstrate semantic zoom

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.600 
so we can demonstrate semantic zoom
really<00:03:49.239> easily<00:03:49.629> by<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.290> using<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.160> Windows

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
really easily by just using the Windows

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.750 
really easily by just using the Windows
8<00:03:51.790> Start<00:03:52.060> screen<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.920> I'm<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.280> my<00:03:54.310> Start<00:03:54.700> screen

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
8 Start screen so I'm on my Start screen

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.589 
8 Start screen so I'm on my Start screen
I<00:03:55.239> can<00:03:55.540> scroll<00:03:55.870> around<00:03:56.670> now<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.480> either

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
I can scroll around now I can either

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.199 
I can scroll around now I can either
hold<00:03:58.959> down<00:03:59.140> control<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.010> move<00:04:00.550> backwards<00:04:00.790> on

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
hold down control and move backwards on

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.720 
hold down control and move backwards on
my<00:04:01.450> mouse<00:04:01.720> wheel<00:04:01.989> or<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:03.280> go<00:04:03.400> down<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.580> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
my mouse wheel or I can go down to the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.150 
my mouse wheel or I can go down to the
bottom<00:04:03.940> right<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.480> click<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:05.080> little<00:04:05.319> minus

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
bottom right and click this little minus

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.190 
bottom right and click this little minus
button<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:08.500> activates<00:04:08.950> semantic<00:04:09.459> zoom

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
button and that activates semantic zoom

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.900 
button and that activates semantic zoom
so<00:04:11.200> notice<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.190> we've<00:04:12.340> lost<00:04:12.519> some<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:12.790> the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
so notice that we've lost some of the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.660 
so notice that we've lost some of the
detail<00:04:13.299> for<00:04:13.629> example<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:14.379> tile<00:04:15.129> names<00:04:15.430> have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
detail for example the tile names have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.270 
detail for example the tile names have
disappeared

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
disappeared

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880 
disappeared
and<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.359> can<00:04:18.570> scroll<00:04:18.840> around<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.320> list<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.739> lot

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
and I can scroll around this list a lot

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.670 
and I can scroll around this list a lot
more<00:04:20.670> quickly<00:04:20.850> than<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.209> could<00:04:21.540> if<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.530> was

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
more quickly than I could if it was

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.510 
more quickly than I could if it was
zoomed<00:04:22.890> in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
zoomed in

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.559 
zoomed in
so<00:04:25.389> as<00:04:25.630> well<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.169> providing<00:04:26.669> navigation<00:04:27.669> we

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
so as well as providing navigation we

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.719 
so as well as providing navigation we
can<00:04:28.750> also<00:04:28.900> use<00:04:29.199> semantic<00:04:29.650> zoom<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:30.099> access<00:04:30.520> new

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
can also use semantic zoom to access new

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.749 
can also use semantic zoom to access new
features<00:04:31.289> so<00:04:32.289> one<00:04:32.919> example<00:04:33.069> of<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.520> would<00:04:33.699> be

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
features so one example of this would be

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.200 
features so one example of this would be
naming<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.630> groups<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.349> Windows<00:04:35.770> 8<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.030> can

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
naming of groups in Windows 8 so I can

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.870 
naming of groups in Windows 8 so I can
select<00:04:37.509> a<00:04:37.599> group<00:04:37.630> here<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.729> go<00:04:39.849> down

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
select a group here and I can go down

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.779 
select a group here and I can go down
and<00:04:40.330> name<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:40.960> let's<00:04:41.740> call<00:04:42.009> it<00:04:42.930> social<00:04:43.930> media

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.999 

now<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:48.819> can<00:04:49.120> choose<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:49.449> of<00:04:49.479> these<00:04:49.630> groups<00:04:50.009> for

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
now I can choose one of these groups for

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.700 
now I can choose one of these groups for
example<00:04:51.430> these<00:04:51.520> Pluralsight<00:04:52.000> demos<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.710> we

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
example these Pluralsight demos and we

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.320 
example these Pluralsight demos and we
zoom<00:04:53.919> back<00:04:53.949> in<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:54.669> zoom<00:04:54.819> back<00:04:54.849> in<00:04:55.120> right

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
zoom back in and we zoom back in right

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.439 
zoom back in and we zoom back in right
over<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.930> group<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.620> we<00:04:56.740> chose<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:58.270> it's<00:04:58.389> a

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
over the group that we chose so it's a

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.550 
over the group that we chose so it's a
really<00:04:58.659> quick<00:04:58.840> way<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.319> navigating<00:05:02.550> around
