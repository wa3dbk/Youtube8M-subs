 missing a complement but you arrived 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.020
 at the precise moment you got me into 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.179
 problems because mom did not accept you for 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.399
 the world that you gave me but I needed you 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.380

 you have no idea out of 2008 I recorded my 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.459
 first song was not 14 years old yet 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.560
 I remember the emotion that became 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.959
 passion when we sign the pact that my 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 Iranian life around your compact 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 evils in my vocal cords at your side 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.820

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.440

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.540

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.100
 the street teaches me what I should never 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.870
 make idols and I'm not going to admire them 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.760
 great that fame is cheating their 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.130
 means and that's why it crashes 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.930
 dedicated time and a thousand nights of sleepless nights 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.330
