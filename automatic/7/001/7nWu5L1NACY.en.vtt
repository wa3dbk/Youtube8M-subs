is<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.719> end<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.969> chespin<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.300> grass

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
is what will end up as chespin the grass

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
is what will end up as chespin the grass

massive palm tree on its back however it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
massive palm tree on its back however it
is<00:01:06.960> indeed<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> gopher<00:01:07.799> Gophers<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.909> pretty

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
is indeed a gopher Gophers are pretty

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.760 
is indeed a gopher Gophers are pretty
troublesome<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.810> you've<00:01:10.260> seen<00:01:10.470> Caddyshack

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
troublesome if you've seen Caddyshack

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
troublesome if you've seen Caddyshack
you'll<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> general<00:01:12.090> idea<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.600> I'm

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you'll have a general idea of what I'm

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
you'll have a general idea of what I'm
talking<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
talking about I think it will just get a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
talking about I think it will just get a
little<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.360> nature<00:01:15.659> mature<00:01:16.259> looking<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
little more nature mature looking and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
little more nature mature looking and
look<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.280> bit<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.759> bandit<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.390> extent

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
look a bit like a bandit to an extent

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.109 
look a bit like a bandit to an extent
and<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> predict<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.220> chespin's<00:01:20.729> final

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and so I predict about chespin's final

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
and so I predict about chespin's final
evolution<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.810> type<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.290> grass<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
evolution will be type it's grass and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
evolution will be type it's grass and
dark<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.640> only<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:23.939> Pokemon<00:01:24.600> type<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
dark the only other Pokemon type this

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
dark the only other Pokemon type this
way<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.350> nuzleaf<00:01:25.740> shiftry<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.520> karen<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
way are nuzleaf shiftry and karen so it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.280 
way are nuzleaf shiftry and karen so it
would<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> welcome<00:01:28.049> change<00:01:29.360> look<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> looks

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
would be a welcome change look it looks

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
would be a welcome change look it looks
like<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.530> little<00:01:31.799> assassin<00:01:32.130> yeah<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
like a little assassin yeah this one is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
like a little assassin yeah this one is
trouble<00:01:36.689> especially<00:01:37.619> since<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.009> been

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
trouble especially since it's been

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.649 
trouble especially since it's been
revealed<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> learns<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> glow<00:01:39.390> punch

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
revealed but it learns a glow punch

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.319 
revealed but it learns a glow punch
people<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.380> been<00:01:40.560> flipping<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:42.000> not

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
people have been flipping out I do not

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
people have been flipping out I do not
think<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.750> his<00:01:43.110> final<00:01:43.500> evolution<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:44.280> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
think that his final evolution will be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
think that his final evolution will be
fire<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.790> fighting<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.810> past<00:01:46.049> three<00:01:46.380> were

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

don't<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:06.869> happen<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> look

into Japanese mythology you may discover

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the kitsune well that translates to Fox

entire mythology behind them bean slides
also<00:02:16.650> been<00:02:16.799> White's<00:02:17.069> keep<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:17.609> mind

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
also been White's keep that in mind

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.270 
also been White's keep that in mind
there's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.569> small<00:02:18.840> small<00:02:19.439> possibility<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:20.159> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
there's a small small possibility of it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
there's a small small possibility of it
being<00:02:20.310> fire<00:02:20.760> flying<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.450> again<00:02:21.689> heavy<00:02:21.989> doubt

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
being fire flying but again heavy doubt

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.500 
being fire flying but again heavy doubt
so<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.159> conclusion<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:23.999> the<00:02:24.090> fennekin's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so in conclusion I think the fennekin's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.410 
so in conclusion I think the fennekin's
final<00:02:24.719> evolution<00:02:25.109> will<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.620> fire<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:25.889> psychic

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
final evolution will be fire and psychic

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.610
