good on nicely and something really well

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.050 
good on nicely and something really well
so<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.830> give<00:02:08.979> them<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.100> skin<00:02:09.369> quieter<00:02:09.819> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
so that's give them a skin quieter a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.880 
so that's give them a skin quieter a
soft<00:02:10.890> silky<00:02:11.890> feel<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:14.260> probably<00:02:14.650> will

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
soft silky feel and it probably will

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.190 
soft silky feel and it probably will
prolong<00:02:15.400> memory<00:02:16.150> levels<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> skin<00:02:17.080> well

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
I'm hoping it will anyway and I think

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.620 
I'm hoping it will anyway and I think
that's<00:02:20.010> another<00:02:23.459> sort<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.640> what's<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.299> it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
that's another sort of what's it for it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.180 
that's another sort of what's it for it

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
it doesn't really say a lot a lot about

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.640 
it doesn't really say a lot a lot about
it<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.670> fair<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.390> says<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.840> um

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.759 

what's<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.830> say<00:02:36.690> exude<00:02:37.690> help<00:02:37.959> from<00:02:38.200> vitality

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
with its energizing skin radiance bar

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.560 
with its energizing skin radiance bar

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
but instantly brightens and tightens for

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.680 
but instantly brightens and tightens for
smooth<00:02:43.870> evening<00:02:44.739> juhi<00:02:44.980> luminosity<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.510> it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
smooth evening juhi luminosity so it's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
smooth evening juhi luminosity so it's
it's<00:02:47.200> supposed<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.500> tighten<00:02:47.920> your<00:02:47.950> skin<00:02:48.280> as

it's supposed to tighten your skin as
well<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.579> bit<00:02:48.820> well<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:50.430> think<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:52.590> can't<00:02:53.590> feel<00:02:53.920> it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
well a bit well I think I can't feel it

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.430 
well a bit well I think I can't feel it
tightening<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.750> has<00:02:56.019> left<00:02:56.290> from<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> skin

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
tightening but it has left from the skin

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.319 
tightening but it has left from the skin
really<00:02:59.440> smooth<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.799> think<00:03:03.790> my<00:03:03.850> makeup<00:03:04.209> will

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
really smooth and I think my makeup will

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.270 
really smooth and I think my makeup will
go<00:03:04.359> on<00:03:04.480> really<00:03:05.019> nice<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.440> top<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.859> so<00:03:06.100> I'm

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
go on really nice on top of it so I'm

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.759
