00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
you know that I'm going to tuck some of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.990 
you know that I'm going to tuck some of
the<00:00:36.260> features<00:00:36.610> in<00:00:37.610> order<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:37.880> take<00:00:37.969> advantage

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
the features in order to take advantage

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.970 
the features in order to take advantage
of<00:00:38.630> a<00:00:38.989> lot<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.320> features<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.710> actually

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
of a lot of the features you actually

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.280 
of a lot of the features you actually
have<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.160> download<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.059> driver<00:00:41.570> information

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
have to download the driver information

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.580 
have to download the driver information
and<00:00:43.300> software<00:00:44.300> um<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.960> works<00:00:45.350> with<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
and software um that works with the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.860 
and software um that works with the
mouse<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.010> that's<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.000> in<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.300> prepackaged

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
mouse and that's not in a prepackaged

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.540 
mouse and that's not in a prepackaged
city<00:00:48.080> so<00:00:48.380> you<00:00:48.440> will<00:00:48.890> need<00:00:49.040> an<00:00:49.190> internet

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
city so you will need an internet

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.060 
city so you will need an internet
connection<00:00:49.610> um<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.320> take<00:00:51.620> advantage<00:00:51.829> of

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
connection um so to take advantage of

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.860 
connection um so to take advantage of
that<00:00:52.130> so<00:00:52.460> um<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.180> guess<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.480> bad<00:00:53.630> for<00:00:53.810> people

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
that so um I guess it's bad for people

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
that so um I guess it's bad for people
that<00:00:54.050> don't<00:00:54.079> have<00:00:54.290> internet<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:54.740> if<00:00:54.800> you're

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
that don't have internet but if you're

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.490 
that don't have internet but if you're
getting<00:00:54.980> an<00:00:55.130> FPS<00:00:55.730> mouse<00:00:56.480> like<00:00:56.810> this<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:57.290> guess

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
getting an FPS mouse like this I guess

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.630 
getting an FPS mouse like this I guess
you<00:00:57.590> would<00:00:57.710> expect<00:00:58.040> you<00:00:58.130> to<00:00:58.250> be<00:00:58.340> able<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.520> have

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
you would expect you to be able to have

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.140 
you would expect you to be able to have
an<00:00:58.730> internet<00:00:59.000> connection<00:00:59.470> so<00:01:00.470> yeah<00:01:00.770> um<00:01:01.150> and

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
an internet connection so yeah um and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.259 
an internet connection so yeah um and
then<00:01:02.450> these<00:01:03.290> are<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.500> DPI<00:01:03.860> buttons<00:01:04.309> there's<00:01:05.149> a

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
then these are the DPI buttons there's a

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.090 
then these are the DPI buttons there's a
constant<00:01:05.630> DPI<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.320> have<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:06.829> you<00:01:06.920> could

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
constant DPI that you have but you could

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.609 
constant DPI that you have but you could
always<00:01:07.549> unchanged<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.119> lower<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:09.320> course

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
always unchanged it lower of course

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.319 
always unchanged it lower of course
you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.799> adjust<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.369> how<00:01:10.549> much<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:11.090> if<00:01:11.240> i

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
you can adjust by how much like if i

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.950 
you can adjust by how much like if i
press<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.570> once<00:01:12.549> you'll<00:01:13.549> do<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.390> slowest

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
press it once you'll do it the slowest

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.139 
press it once you'll do it the slowest
profile<00:01:15.350> i<00:01:15.380> have<00:01:15.679> and<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.280> i<00:01:16.369> do<00:01:16.429> it<00:01:16.579> up<00:01:16.670> once<00:01:16.939> or

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
profile i have and if i do it up once or

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.999 
profile i have and if i do it up once or
do<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.329> highest<00:01:17.600> profile<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.170> everything<00:01:18.889> in

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
do the highest profile and everything in

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.889 
do the highest profile and everything in
between<00:01:19.100> will<00:01:19.579> be<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.850> constant<00:01:20.420> one<00:01:20.659> that

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
between will be the constant one that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.660 
between will be the constant one that
you<00:01:21.109> use<00:01:21.170> for<00:01:21.319> you<00:01:22.159> know<00:01:22.249> i<00:01:22.310> guess<00:01:22.520> probably

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
you use for you know i guess probably

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.959 
you use for you know i guess probably
just<00:01:23.060> normal<00:01:23.420> desktop<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:24.189> applications<00:01:25.189> so

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
just normal desktop on applications so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.410 
just normal desktop on applications so
and<00:01:26.569> then<00:01:26.719> a<00:01:26.810> sniping<00:01:27.170> button<00:01:27.469> works<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.130> well

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and then a sniping button works as well

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.029 
and then a sniping button works as well
that<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.450> hold<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.959> down<00:01:30.109> and<00:01:30.469> deal<00:01:30.829> with<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
that you hold it down and deal with the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.010 
that you hold it down and deal with the
keys<00:01:31.219> your<00:01:31.369> dpi<00:01:31.700> or<00:01:31.880> whatever<00:01:32.479> DPI<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.899> have

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
keys your dpi or whatever DPI you have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.709 
keys your dpi or whatever DPI you have
it<00:01:33.109> set<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.319> 0<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:34.219> will<00:01:34.369> enable<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.789> DPI<00:01:35.119> until

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
it set to 0 I will enable the DPI until

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.149 
it set to 0 I will enable the DPI until
you<00:01:35.780> let<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:35.990> go<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:36.439> I'll<00:01:36.709> restore<00:01:37.009> its

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
you let it go and then I'll restore its

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.849 
you let it go and then I'll restore its
normal<00:01:37.520> DPI<00:01:37.819> and<00:01:38.289> obviously<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.499> had<00:01:39.679> little

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
normal DPI and obviously you had little

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.699 
normal DPI and obviously you had little
two<00:01:40.009> buttons<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:40.369> um<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.569> don't<00:01:41.990> really<00:01:42.229> use

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
two buttons here um I don't really use

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.949 
two buttons here um I don't really use
them<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.219> actual<00:01:43.880> games<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:44.749> I'm<00:01:44.840> on

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
them for actual games but when I'm on

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.809 
them for actual games but when I'm on
the<00:01:44.990> internet<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.979> bottom<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.490> right<00:01:46.639> here

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
the internet the bottom one right here

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.999 
the internet the bottom one right here
already<00:01:47.209> can<00:01:47.420> see<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.899> there<00:01:48.709> you<00:01:48.799> go<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
already can see that there you go you

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.649 
already can see that there you go you
can<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:49.219> reaches<00:01:49.549> now<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:50.240> bottom<00:01:50.630> one

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
can see that reaches now this bottom one

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.120 
can see that reaches now this bottom one
I'm<00:01:50.899> currently<00:01:51.170> covered<00:01:51.649> with<00:01:51.770> my<00:01:51.859> thumb

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
I'm currently covered with my thumb

I'm currently covered with my thumb
there<00:01:52.609> you<00:01:52.700> don't<00:01:52.789> see<00:01:53.029> that<00:01:53.179> that<00:01:53.439> would<00:01:54.439> be

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
there you don't see that that would be

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.239 
there you don't see that that would be
going<00:01:55.399> back<00:01:55.579> on<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.849> browser<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:58.039> top

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
going back on the browser and the top

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.129 
going back on the browser and the top
one<00:01:58.399> would<00:01:58.520> be<00:01:58.670> going<00:01:58.909> forward<00:01:59.359> on<00:01:59.719> with<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
one would be going forward on with the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:05.019 
one would be going forward on with the
browser<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.340> um<00:02:01.609> yeah<00:02:01.849> um<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.499> then<00:02:04.249> this<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:04.999> a

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
browser so um yeah um and then this is a

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.699 
browser so um yeah um and then this is a
scroll<00:02:05.329> wheel<00:02:05.509> obviously<00:02:06.109> you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.499> you<00:02:06.560> can

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
scroll wheel obviously you know you can

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:07.779 
scroll wheel obviously you know you can
do<00:02:06.829> whichever<00:02:07.069> you<00:02:07.219> want<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.609> press<00:02:07.759> it

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
do whichever you want you can press it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.630 
do whichever you want you can press it
down<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.300> middle<00:02:08.569> button<00:02:08.750> too<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.250> let's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
down for the middle button too so let's

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.430 
down for the middle button too so let's
get<00:02:10.819> stuff<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.420> then<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.900> bottom<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.410> have

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
get stuff and then the bottom you have

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.309 
get stuff and then the bottom you have
the<00:02:12.680> weights<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.819> remove<00:02:14.270> them<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.690> then

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
the weights you can remove them and then

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.770 
the weights you can remove them and then
you<00:02:16.069> can<00:02:16.280> make<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.490> mouse<00:02:16.640> lighter<00:02:17.030> so

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
you can make the mouse lighter so

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.720 
you can make the mouse lighter so
therefore<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.709> can<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.010> don't<00:02:19.190> know<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.489> guess

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
therefore you can you don't know I guess

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.070 
therefore you can you don't know I guess
if<00:02:19.909> it<00:02:20.030> bothers<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:20.299> that's<00:02:20.780> have

if it bothers you that's have
or<00:02:21.170> something<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> could<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.800> rid<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.980> those

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
or something you could get rid of those

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.960 
or something you could get rid of those
but<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.730> kept<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.270> stock<00:02:23.540> um<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:25.520> yeah<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
but I kept it stock um but yeah so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.920 
but I kept it stock um but yeah so
overall<00:02:26.540> um<00:02:27.280> my<00:02:28.280> review<00:02:29.150> first<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.540> all<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.780> can

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
overall um my review first of all it can

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630 
overall um my review first of all it can
be<00:02:30.080> comparative<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.950> means<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.220> I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
be comparative so that means that I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.100 
be comparative so that means that I
can't<00:02:32.150> say<00:02:32.330> it's<00:02:32.540> better<00:02:32.690> than<00:02:32.870> something

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
can't say it's better than something

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.410 
can't say it's better than something
else<00:02:33.410> that's<00:02:34.100> under<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.430> same<00:02:34.700> category<00:02:34.730> C

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
else that's under the same category C

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.940 
else that's under the same category C
because<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.870> mouse<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.080> geared<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:36.590> gaming

it's not comparative it's wireless which
is<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.770> wired<00:02:52.040> solution<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> can't<00:02:53.300> really

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
is a wired solution so I can't really

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.390 
is a wired solution so I can't really
say<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.680> best<00:02:54.830> gaming<00:02:55.190> mouse

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
that and yeah it's brilliant but again I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.020 
that and yeah it's brilliant but again I
did<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> wireless<00:03:36.950> mouse<00:03:37.310> beforehand<00:03:37.910> so

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
did have a wireless mouse beforehand so

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.729 
did have a wireless mouse beforehand so
automatically<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.810> left<00:03:39.170> me<00:03:39.320> at<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.440> huge

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
automatically that left me at a huge

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.370 
automatically that left me at a huge
disadvantage<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.540> was<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> dramatic

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
disadvantage so it was like a dramatic

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.440 
disadvantage so it was like a dramatic
upgrade<00:03:42.830> from<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.190> wireless<00:03:43.940> solutions<00:03:44.330> is

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
upgrade from that wireless solutions is

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.229 
upgrade from that wireless solutions is
wired<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.590> know<00:03:45.739> beast<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.610> high<00:03:46.760> DPI

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
wired you know beast with the high DPI

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.150 
wired you know beast with the high DPI
ice<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.840> maximum<00:03:48.350> setting<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.890> great

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
ice like maximum setting is a great

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.000 
ice like maximum setting is a great
sensor<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.790> what<00:03:49.940> nuts<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.350> think<00:03:51.769> that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
sensor and what nuts so I think that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.870 
sensor and what nuts so I think that
actually<00:03:52.850> made<00:03:53.090> my<00:03:53.300> results<00:03:53.870> um<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.850> guess<00:03:55.850> uh

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
actually made my results um I guess uh

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.759 
actually made my results um I guess uh
well<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.660> guess<00:03:56.930> my<00:03:57.080> experience<00:03:57.590> was

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
well I guess my experience was

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.860 
well I guess my experience was
dramatically<00:03:58.280> better<00:03:58.670> with<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.239> mouse<00:03:59.510> from

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
dramatically better with this mouse from

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.600 
dramatically better with this mouse from
that<00:04:00.110> previous<00:04:00.380> because<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.010> was<00:04:01.220> at<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> normal

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
that previous because I was at a normal

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.490 
that previous because I was at a normal
I<00:04:01.790> was<00:04:01.910> at<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> very<00:04:02.540> bad<00:04:02.750> disadvantage<00:04:03.320> so

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
I was at a very bad disadvantage so

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.110 
I was at a very bad disadvantage so
anything<00:04:04.070> that<00:04:04.100> was<00:04:04.400> geared<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:04.880> getting

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
anything that was geared for getting

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.640 
anything that was geared for getting
probably<00:04:05.360> would<00:04:05.450> look<00:04:05.600> better<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.470> word

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
probably would look better in the word

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.550 
probably would look better in the word
within<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.220> wireless<00:04:07.550> solution<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.660> um<00:04:08.900> this

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
within the wireless solution but um this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.740 
within the wireless solution but um this
mouse<00:04:09.890> was<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.239> picked<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.720> I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
mouse was the one that I picked and I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.710 
mouse was the one that I picked and I
love<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.800> yeah<00:04:13.040> uh<00:04:13.269> yeah<00:04:14.269> there's<00:04:14.540> no

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
love it so yeah uh yeah there's no

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.229 
love it so yeah uh yeah there's no
comfort<00:04:15.050> issues<00:04:15.680> there's<00:04:16.280> um<00:04:16.580> you<00:04:17.090> know

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
comfort issues there's um you know

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
keep rubbing it on like a surface of the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.600 
keep rubbing it on like a surface of the
mousepad<00:04:20.750> that's<00:04:21.290> kind<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.530> like<00:04:21.739> clot<00:04:22.310> light

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
mousepad that's kind of like clot light

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580 
mousepad that's kind of like clot light
you<00:04:22.850> get<00:04:23.000> shocked<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.630> there<00:04:24.020> once<00:04:24.320> been

a<00:04:52.410> 9.5<00:04:53.160> out<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.400> 10<00:04:53.610> again<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:54.660> is<00:04:54.720> like<00:04:55.080> an

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
a 9.5 out of 10 again this is like an

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.420 
a 9.5 out of 10 again this is like an
independent<00:04:57.320> results<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.650> relates<00:04:59.130> no

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
independent results that relates no

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.550 
independent results that relates no
other<00:04:59.610> gigging<00:04:59.940> mice<00:05:00.120> out<00:05:00.300> there<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:01.320> if

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
other gigging mice out there but if

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.160 
other gigging mice out there but if
you're<00:05:01.800> looking<00:05:01.830> for<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.510> guess<00:05:03.540> if<00:05:03.960> you're

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
you're looking for it I guess if you're

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.410 
you're looking for it I guess if you're
like<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> noob<00:05:04.980> we<00:05:05.310> have<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.460> wireless<00:05:05.760> solution

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
like a noob we have a wireless solution

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.730 
like a noob we have a wireless solution
did<00:05:06.570> not<00:05:06.690> know<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:06.930> will<00:05:07.230> leave<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.620> at<00:05:07.680> a

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
did not know that will leave you at a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.740 
did not know that will leave you at a
disadvantage<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.060> want<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.330> bump<00:05:09.480> up<00:05:09.630> to

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
disadvantage and you want to bump up to

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.630 
disadvantage and you want to bump up to
something<00:05:10.050> dramatically<00:05:10.500> better<00:05:10.710> get<00:05:11.430> this

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
something dramatically better get this

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.270 
something dramatically better get this
um<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:13.020> don't<00:05:13.230> know<00:05:13.470> if<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.800> lot<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.980> people<00:05:14.040> can

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
um I don't know if a lot of people can

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.910 
um I don't know if a lot of people can
relate<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.970> this<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:15.270> sometimes<00:05:15.750> like<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.590> I

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
relate to this but sometimes like if I

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.380 
relate to this but sometimes like if I
could<00:05:17.100> have<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.460> moved<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:18.030> little<00:05:18.210> bit

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
could have just moved a little bit

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.720 
could have just moved a little bit
quicker<00:05:18.840> on<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.260> last<00:05:19.500> turn<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.460> would

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
quicker on that last turn and I would

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.490 
quicker on that last turn and I would
have<00:05:20.820> actually<00:05:20.940> lived<00:05:21.420> or<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:22.080> would<00:05:22.470> have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
have actually lived or I would have

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.040 
have actually lived or I would have
actually<00:05:22.710> shot<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.550> guy<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.150> got<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.870> kill

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
actually shot the guy and got that kill

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.250 
actually shot the guy and got that kill
that<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.260> needed<00:05:25.470> this<00:05:26.310> mice<00:05:26.900> very<00:05:27.900> good<00:05:28.080> for

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
that I needed this mice very good for

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.860 
that I needed this mice very good for
that<00:05:28.380> very<00:05:28.950> very<00:05:29.310> good<00:05:29.550> for<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.180> near<00:05:30.510> like

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
that very very good for that near like

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.600 
that very very good for that near like
oh<00:05:31.020> just<00:05:31.350> one<00:05:31.650> more<00:05:31.680> shot<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:32.460> more

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
oh just one more shot that one more

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.220 
oh just one more shot that one more
bullet<00:05:32.820> would<00:05:33.060> have<00:05:33.090> done<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.390> this<00:05:33.930> is<00:05:34.110> the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
bullet would have done it this is the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.400 
bullet would have done it this is the
mice<00:05:34.410> for<00:05:34.620> that<00:05:34.770> um<00:05:35.070> or<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.120> mouse<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.720> yeah

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
mice for that um or the mouse and yeah

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.340 
mice for that um or the mouse and yeah
so<00:05:37.650> definitely<00:05:38.010> very<00:05:38.760> very<00:05:38.850> good<00:05:39.210> Mouse<00:05:39.540> the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
so definitely very very good Mouse the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.380 
so definitely very very good Mouse the
reason<00:05:40.680> why<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.890> took<00:05:41.130> point<00:05:41.460> five<00:05:41.670> off<00:05:42.030> of

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
reason why it took point five off of

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.550 
reason why it took point five off of
this<00:05:42.870> mouse<00:05:43.230> is<00:05:43.790> because<00:05:44.790> um<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:46.020> sniping

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
this mouse is because um the sniping

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.850 
this mouse is because um the sniping
button<00:05:46.890> is<00:05:47.070> kind<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:47.340> gimmicky<00:05:47.900> like<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:49.290> could

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
button is kind of gimmicky like I could

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.680 
button is kind of gimmicky like I could
just<00:05:50.070> decrease<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.760> but<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.300> could<00:05:51.450> decrease

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
just decrease it but I could decrease

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.090 
just decrease it but I could decrease
the<00:05:51.780> DPI<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:53.190> know<00:05:53.310> like<00:05:53.550> BAM<00:05:53.790> and<00:05:54.170> then<00:05:55.170> like

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
the DPI you know like BAM and then like

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.040 
the DPI you know like BAM and then like
you<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.640> like<00:05:56.850> ill<00:05:57.150> be<00:05:57.270> at<00:05:57.390> that<00:05:57.570> constant

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
you know like ill be at that constant

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.480 
you know like ill be at that constant
load<00:05:58.170> epi<00:05:58.560> that<00:05:58.800> the<00:05:58.890> sniping<00:05:59.130> bun<00:05:59.370> can

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
load epi that the sniping bun can

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.880 
load epi that the sniping bun can
emulate<00:05:59.820> but<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.960> do<00:06:01.050> kind<00:06:01.320> of<00:06:01.440> get<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:01.590> point

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
emulate but I do kind of get the point

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.380 
emulate but I do kind of get the point
that<00:06:02.070> sometimes<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.730> don't<00:06:02.910> have<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.240> time

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
that sometimes you don't have the time

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.360 
that sometimes you don't have the time
to<00:06:03.510> go<00:06:03.540> like<00:06:03.720> down<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:04.350> then<00:06:04.680> back<00:06:04.710> up<00:06:05.100> because

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
to go like down and then back up because

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.400 
to go like down and then back up because
I<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.640> that<00:06:06.210> little<00:06:06.420> Spade<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.990> little<00:06:07.200> time

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
I know that little Spade the little time

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.530 
I know that little Spade the little time
that<00:06:07.650> it<00:06:07.710> takes<00:06:07.860> can<00:06:08.370> get<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:08.640> killed<00:06:08.880> so<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.390> do

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
that it takes can get you killed so I do

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.940 
that it takes can get you killed so I do
to<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.870> point<00:06:10.080> of<00:06:10.110> just<00:06:10.290> grabbing<00:06:10.440> it<00:06:10.830> and

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
to the point of just grabbing it and

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
then using it whenever you need it and

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.630 
then using it whenever you need it and
letting<00:06:12.870> go<00:06:13.050> whenever<00:06:13.260> you<00:06:13.500> don't<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:13.980> but<00:06:14.610> i
