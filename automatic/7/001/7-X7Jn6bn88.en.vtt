00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
line and a lot of people don't realize

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
line and a lot of people don't realize
that<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.989> old<00:00:49.140> fuel<00:00:49.469> line<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.070> sat<00:00:50.370> long

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that that old fuel line if it's sat long

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
that that old fuel line if it's sat long
enough<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.510> doesn't<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.110> dry<00:00:52.350> right<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
enough it doesn't just dry right on the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
enough it doesn't just dry right on the
outside<00:00:53.250> it'll<00:00:53.579> dry<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> inside

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
outside it'll dry right on the inside

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.470 
outside it'll dry right on the inside
and<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.920> happens<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.120> running

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and what happens is then you go running

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
and what happens is then you go running
fresh<00:00:57.719> fuel<00:00:57.960> through<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> sure<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.829> runs<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
fresh fuel through it sure it runs good

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670

for a couple of days and then all of a
sudden<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.250> chunks<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> fuel<00:01:03.180> line<00:01:03.449> on

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
sudden you got chunks of fuel line on

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.299
