00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello dear I've thought I 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.609
 make a small walk like once again 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.440
 for you have already quite again 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.580
 many products bought this as well 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.139
 not had so far 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 That's why I thought I show 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.040
 Maybe you are the ones too 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 what for you and I'll catch four 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.039
 I have completely rediscovered that image 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.080
 and indeed the vegetables are many stripes 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.750
 Girls do not even see them 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.260
 so bad from so williams I have with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.540
 edeka is also very big on it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 usually so I never was so 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.930
 meat eater disgust me really from 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 meat and the reason is since me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.399
 have addressed that is there also helped 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 no account, no pages, nothing 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.730
 in it is because I like this one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 meat products straight on pages 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 Not really that way because of me now 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 So similar to meat are so if 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 you really looking for meat products 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.539
 then it can replace really good 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 Of course, great for someone like me 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 which is really controls on meat 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.579
 that of course then bad though I do 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.830
 knows that there is no animal in it but it is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.560
 just too real you know what I mean 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 it's just too risky headache 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.430
 but I can not turn it off 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 and you say the ingredients list angeguckt 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 and I was just amazed that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.299
 is really vegetables mainly vegetables is so 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 need peas onion juice concentrate 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.549
 doctors protein bit strength water 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.049
 sunflower natural aroma spices 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.330
 paprika pepper ginger nutmeg 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.390
 crunchy cadre of chilli salt and vinegar 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 and that's it and then there comes something 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.869
 at out so I have no idea how 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.350
 that tastes that I have to put you on everyone 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.369
 case because in the eaten video then times 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 says or if you the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.430
 products already I know you show 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.689
 Of course, I also wanted to have your own 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.820
 Write opinion if you are her 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.220
 already knows how it tastes 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.369
 and I have as said by erika 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 and my prices is exactly where two euros 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 89 of elika then I have times 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.650
 again bread spreads brought and that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.590
 From aldi I once like bio 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.450
 harish yummy linsencurry biology 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.649
 spread cream and herbs tomato 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.380
 So biovalley is just raising cancer 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.310
 linsencurry I'm a bit 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 I have never had any 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.490
 occurs with lenses when I have time 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.110
 curious how these herbs taste 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.050
 I already have tomato from 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.330
 alnatura and edeka I want yes 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.010
 mostly just this tomato paprika 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.720
 chilli especially in the field 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.800
 I just taste the best there can 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.280
 I just really want to be sure about myself 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.840
 taste 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.070
 because in south korea i found a lot 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.940
 interesting because I have to look first 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.200
 how they taste 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.730
 and I'll take another look at the others 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 should what is there but I wanted 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 I do not first now remains for me now 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
 Do not pick so much and I have 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 here are 50,000 are always yes 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.959
 again everything bad about it after 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.459
 and after the cost 169 apiece then 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.280
 I have yet to aufstrich brought 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.390
 read from edeka here and that is the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.800
 fine herbs spread soffin resort 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.290
 or nee there is only fine herbs 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.910
 spread okay there are several varieties 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.780
 I still think cutler and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.610
 I think something with pepper 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.739
 not looking closely at it now 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.120
 I've been flirting with that for a while now, yes 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.080
 have him a while ago at edeka 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.780
 discovered there is no genetic engineering on it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.630
 100% vegan fresh and creamy facto 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.780
 fermented tofu and there I already have 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.920
 thought so a little bit again because I 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
 I've even told you how I like it 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.940
 These tofu sides products not so 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.630
 with pleasure 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.760
 and that's just a tofu stroke 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.910
 in the first list in the first place at the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.709
 That's why I first have tofu 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.600
 Waited until others in the way 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.670
 groups evi quaid post because I completely 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.320
 exactly what was new there was completely 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.890
 soon we'll post well or sometime 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.299
 not good 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.070
 That's why I thought okay then 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.410
 I can find it now, too 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.620
 and he was already up 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:55.240
 he cost a bit more expensive 290 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.130
 we are 125 dig in there I am yes 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.870
 wonder if that really like sunbathe 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.550
 how is such a cream cheese or have it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.470
 I also from the reformhaus times 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.890
 something good again and was once organic cocoa 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.170
 is also entirely on vegan because I 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.400
 the last few days have something for her 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.600
 I did not want to know what 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.180
 is true I think it was something 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.860
 beauty area or maybe something too 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.750
 with joost chocolate I do not remember 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.150
 Definitely important for something 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.130
 and then I thought 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.330
 But you do not have cocoa butter right now 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.370
 here because it was not and now 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.350
 So far, no buck will get in extra 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.610
 town center in bioladen previously now have 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.180
 I always tied in advance 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.470
 took 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.170
 I do not remember what I mean now 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.470
 I wanted to have women again 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.120
 what can you do with it what can 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.610
 you can do with it, writes the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.510
 Commission can do it with it 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.090
 293 city then I'm here again 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.130
 such a chocolate brought whole almond too 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.480
 But I can get out of the reformhaus 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.800
 honestly out of print I got 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.210
 namely thought that we are in his hot 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.860
 Milk chocolate as such an extra 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.450
 vegan-made chocolate 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.640
 this is the stink normal tooth 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.810
 bitter chocolate bio time 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.060
 bitter chocolate with whole 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.700
 caramelised almonds has 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.600
 I would have bitter chocolate too 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.390
 can get cheaper these are 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.340
 namely now only 45 grams and the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.620
 150 could because I know myself as a 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.020
 a bit off because at decade for example 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.640
 Out of the drawer and these blogs 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.919
 For example, chocolate costs around 90 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.960
 cent is somehow threefold 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.550
 weight or four research even and 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.110
 I like bitter chocolate on you 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.970
 yes that shows up again that one 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.350
 Just read it before you get them 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.810
 but that will be me 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.470
 someday also offered again 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.060
 I have you in the last vegan wool 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.760
 gyros presented by edeka what investors 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.100
 is awesome 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:47.100
 or is of course the associated peter 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.990
 grote you notice the bread pizza bread and 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.490
 biscuits peter stremmel peter room 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.570
 may not be missing 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.970
 so that you have a really nice 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.480
 can thinner and they are now 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.900
 was the network are five pieces in it 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.310
 and yes had Greek flag and 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.980
 easy and I looked at it 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.460
 there is only water packages feed 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.600
 even and sugar in it and I still have 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.280
 looked at another supermarkets 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.420
 Bikers are also still there which are 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.620
 the ingredients but always a bit 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.510
 different with dk for example is no 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.180
 sugar and vinegar over brandy 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.710
 and as soon as sugar or vinegar is in it 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.690
 questionable always like it 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.510
 is a way to make sure that there 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.680
 really vegan anyway and was there 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.180
 Merkel eight years are definitely 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.580
 suitable for vegans and then I have 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.620
 they also brought me that now 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.060
 the city meanwhile third pack 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.850
 because lately I just too much 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.380
 a lot of pyros it yes they just strengthen you 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.510
 halve a toaster in the 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.710
 stick toaster and then you can use it 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.090
 stop and doner make as month possible 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.840
 it did not cost that much anymore 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.820
 to have 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.900
 then have two things again 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.460
 fetched that I appointed you ever 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.900
 once showed this chocolate 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.340
 soy drink from aldi 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.020
 the cost is 99 cents I had now 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.950
 I'm looking forward to a little bit of chocolate 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.390
 I like it best 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.190
 That's why I really like it very soon 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.290
 is synonymous even cheaper is available 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.940
 ali the vanilla me again 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.010
 but brought it is empty again 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.040
 and what now synonymous with us at net 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.270
 are these mandl drinks so i am 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.710
 does not know if they have been with you for some time 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.540
 in net there are so with us there 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.130
 only now and expect directly at 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.380
 offer therefore at the end a whole 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.600
 pallet taken 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.070
 it costs them the 269 or so 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.020
 that's why it's such a bit
