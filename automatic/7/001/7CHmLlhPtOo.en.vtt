00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 until now 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.800
 everyone 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.710
 I am day 15 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.740
 today I bring you a very good tutorial and I am sure that more 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.550
 one will like it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.240
 this one like changing the initial animation that comes out when you start a psp game 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.080
 but first 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.110
 he clarified that this is a safe method and his psp is not at risk 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.100
 I say it 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.340
 since this operation is known as dangerous for the classes of the psp 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.910
 but nevertheless this one is not 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.280
 This one is 100% safe 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 since nothing will be avoided to the psp system 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 this is possible thanks to a plugin 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.840
 go where I go 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.960
 I leave the download link in the description 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.460
 and I also leave you a pack with five different starts 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.360
 He also clarified that in order to run the plugin they need one of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 these versions of check or in your psp 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.659
 If they have a different one, update it with a custom firmware 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.650
 first download the description files 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.930
 now we open the call madigan where you voted 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 there we will see two folders 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 we pass them to the desk 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.110
 we connect our psp to the pc 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.210
 this is not the real memory of a psp is just the example of it 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.650
 you do connect it and that's how you normally see the memory of the psp 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.540
 we drag directly the two folders to the memory of the psp 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 if you ask to substitute data, they give you yes 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.349
 now look for the folder called mahiga ndonga m booth in the memory of your psp 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.539
 will open 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 there we will place the beginnings 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:33.049
 now open the father starts downloaded 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.179
 there you will see the five 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 now they pass the folders to the desk 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.419
 open the folder with the start they want 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.419
 You can find one or two files 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:08.759
 they pass them to the madigan folder where it snowed from the memory of the psp 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.659
 do not change the name, leave them like that because yes, it will not work 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.590
 if they wish 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.590
 they can put all five and they will be reproduced randomly 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.689
 disconnect your psp and completely turn off the console leaving the 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.230
 power button pressed for 10 seconds and turn on the while 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.849
 you keep the button the challenged 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.429
 you will enter the recovery mode 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.349
 there you give the option that says plugins 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.700
 you open with x now look for one called 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.129
 ripen where better 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.989
 it must appear there 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.180
 they give him with x he has to be on the right with the word 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.489
 as well as in the image 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.819
 if you are already in avilÃ©s has been an example 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.069
 and if you want to disable the start 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.180
 just do the same and put it in 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.569
 and saber 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.690
 now it gives you nothing 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.169
 behind 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.110
 and they give him out 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.539
 I already have our special start for psp 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.719
 now just open an iso and the start will vary 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.360
 now we will have beginnings 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.059
 like these 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.620
 or some of the others that I put 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.430
 these beginnings are not seen in the inhabitant of ps 1 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.830
 only in those and other applications 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.560
 that's it 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.759
 I hope I could explain the 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.490
 Any doubt, tell me I will answer 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.270
