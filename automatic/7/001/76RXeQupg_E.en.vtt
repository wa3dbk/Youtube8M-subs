00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 right now 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.960
 you 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.630
 you would do that kind of cargo and with the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.669
 bald, really, really, I think 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.669
 that all part of the trust that 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.130
 you have with the companions there is 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.930
 my point of view is this I always 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.490
 they hire on a stage and they put me 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.290
 Encourage someone you never know 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.930
 there's a game like that you do 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.030
 but if I know him and I have confidence 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.320
 with him as it can be something in some of 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.670
 my companions here not like the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.520
 problem is that I can order and 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.730
 doing all that means that if you 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.760
 about Aryan succession 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.090
 Now with two people they want to 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.520
 charge to be a strange country or that is not 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.650
 they lost right now, not if it's okay 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 I know well because obviously he does not have 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.800
 studies not certain obvious yes clear 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 your partner does not do the same 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 I imagine no 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.690
 Actually I think I can talk to you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.370
 for me, I mean he's free to do what 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 what you think best in your work 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.250
 because everyone decides that I then 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 I would ask a question a question before 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.840
 to move on to another topic right now while 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.910
 you are here in the program sharing 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.979
 with thousands and thousands of Peruvians who 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.619
 they have fun working, jumping, sweating 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.290
 fat drop jumping hurdles 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 by the tires pulling the bell you know 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.340
 that the child can not be a pure digit 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.210
 I'm bored, you know what 's 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.479
 doing 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.479
 uy 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.020
 ah 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.650
 good kids good now I just got 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.830
 learned by their peers while 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.250
 the child spoke 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.840
 that there are things that have personal 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.610
 I'm not going to say anything because they have not 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 said nothing and personal things that each 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.340
 one has but what the child has not 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 it's nothing bad 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.470
 but something bad I think here is not 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 something would never do that but if it is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.440
 a dance does not bother me 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.000
 there may be nobody let's see what you have 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 hey care and not me with you 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 let's see what we're going to see 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:46.170
 and good being part of a choreography 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.600
 true there he was dancing and he's in 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.170
 full competition 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 and you more 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.930
 there I am 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.150
 true 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.150
 d 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820
 and for many years 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 all the best artists in the world 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:39.480
 travolta also many years and many 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480
 years 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.380
 images until joselito bailo 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:08.240
 and it seems to me that he danced very well in 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.610
 actually I think that there should be 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.190
 I have not seen the program but it comes part 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.440
 of his work the east has to follow 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 growing up and has won a reality show 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.070
 dance so how good to follow 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.780
 profession I walk the steps is that everything 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.350
 all right 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.139
 but and the dance of columbia we have there 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.450
 by tourists that kind of dance and not 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.120
 it's fashionable right now to swing on 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.240
 next month was the maca comes from before 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.760
 they were the rollerblades I do not know 10 7 or they auto 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.260
 you prefer that the Lord go to others 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.870
 programs to do the dances of 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.690
 swing and here it forbids you is to dance and 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.690
 that comes to dance for our team 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.690
 go figure 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.930
 I suddenly entered the audience 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.580
 a bad reaction was part of my way 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.410
 of being I have a difficult character but 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.630
 that does not mean that I forbid 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.220
 so the saying yes no no 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.570
 dancing but let's see let's listen 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.450
 because because we see that it has very 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.690
 movement to the squad girls 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.450
 genesis as you see Luis are very well and 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.180
 I wonder or see and I see it there I see it 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.220
 very loose bone dancing i want 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050
 I remember because I did not miss any 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.240
 welcome chapter when I was with 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.120
 my rehabilitation and polished it remember 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.660
 that Dora was upset to dance here 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.610
 and he is more admitted and said when I speak 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.170
 with the production I was not going to dance 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.930
 because he was not going to do anything that 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:39.500
 will bother worship now that is dancing 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.500
 there he asked me will continue with now 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:49.050
 because he does because he dances paula bueno yo 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.840
 I think it's part of his job 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.060
 when I tell them I did not want to dance here 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.310
 or it was a confusion 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.770
 maybe now it bothered him 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.560
 I gave him to do them because it's his environment 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.950
 work your program but I think it's 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.540
 part of the human listening process he 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.180
 was the program to participate and I do not see him 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.560
 nothing bad and now he also tells us 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.400
 so it's fine 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 jimena 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.040
 the decisions are changing through 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.410
 of time maybe at that moment right now 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.880
 I did not want you to dance here but maybe 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.280
 now they came to a subject one 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.470
 conversation and has allowed him now 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.480
 can participate in those types of dance 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.520
 how ugly the eye can be 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.190
 right now the time is going 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.169
 changing the mission that's the scream 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.570
 good will suddenly see others 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.860
 realities so that he can come here 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.930
 I can dance with some of my 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.280
 partners the arguments if I was hit by a 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.410
 little because in the first time what 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.370
 they invited to dance and it was against me but 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.990
 now normal any other to the squad 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.430
 Well, I'd like you to open it but 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.060
 if they do not produce it said that the platoon is 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.060
 for Peru
