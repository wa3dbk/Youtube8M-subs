00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello youtube friends as they are today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 I bring you a new video tutorial of the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 pixel art series we're just going to do this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 diamond sword minecraft as in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.950
 here is the name is for sword 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.320
 minecraft good since this wool that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.119
 I have here and we are going to think blocks of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.279
 diamond and wood and all the other wins 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 that have inventories are going to need 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.470
 obviously and now we are going to make a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.239
 square here always leaving the center 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.659
 so let's remove this one from here we're going to 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.659
 put lean oak as well as 3 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.940
 rows like that without corners and now surrounded 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.479
 we're going to put the brown nothing here like this 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.539
 then we 're going to put the blackest 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:50.289
 one here always good until we go to 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.960
 mark the quiet and good here 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.739
 know him 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.980
 in the wood block another one here we go to 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.870
 upload 2 as well as the other now 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 here we are going to put without the corners and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 end here if the corners have 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.229
 betrayed as I like it, there's 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 put a corner here, let's go 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.330
 have to put two here we go down 2 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.420
 two 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.430
 we take the corner 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 another two we remove the corners of what 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.830
 that this corner does not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.680
 and now we go down 1 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.710
 always without the corners and now another the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.460
 another corner here we are already going to 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 have that around the corner 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.780
 so we were two others here 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.520
 already the last thing that we would have something like that and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.030
 now this here we are going to fill it with 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 xian wool 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.210
 remember that it has to be the notion 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.460
 if they want it to look good, good face 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.920
 around here for all the spaces that 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.119
 we leave like this we already have as frame is the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.460
 sword now what we 're going to have to 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.340
 to do is this part but the same with the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.420
 black whom we remove this and here we go to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.690
 go up 12 blocks 17 forgive then 12 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 3 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 42 56 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.569
 to 7 and good to this that would be the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.740
 corner 2 so we're going to have to 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.630
 put 3 blocks here and we go down 2 like that and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.170
 same from the other side of here down 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.850
 so here we are the same corner 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.680
 the same we remove the corners always 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.480
 because everything that we are going forward to 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.030
 put to add an effect like 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.410
 Shiny as well as the one here 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.930
 by my side as parents to my side 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
 It looks like bright then I'm better 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 so you know you can put with this 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.980

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.710

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.950

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.960

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.880
