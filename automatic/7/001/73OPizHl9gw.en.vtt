be well the old trailer used to be right
about<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.570> wanna<00:02:31.870> say<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.140> where<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:32.440> ended

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
about here I wanna say is where it ended

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.030 
about here I wanna say is where it ended
and<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.550> stood<00:02:33.730> at<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.420> room<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.980> you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and we stood at all that room so you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.560 
and we stood at all that room so you
could<00:02:36.250> probably<00:02:36.400> fit<00:02:36.760> forward<00:02:37.210> here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
could probably fit forward here

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.750 
could probably fit forward here
I<00:02:37.600> mean<00:02:37.840> you're<00:02:38.050> pretty<00:02:38.170> fits<00:02:38.470> 5<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.130> if

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
I mean you're pretty fits 5 in here if

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270 
I mean you're pretty fits 5 in here if
you<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.570> did<00:02:40.870> them<00:02:41.020> right<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.920> it

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you you know did them right but it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.030 
you you know did them right but it
definitely<00:02:42.490> will<00:02:42.790> fit<00:02:43.000> floor<00:02:43.210> comfortably<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
definitely will fit floor comfortably a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.350 
definitely will fit floor comfortably a
reason<00:02:45.040> why<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.190> get<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.550> kind<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.970> style<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.240> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
reason why I get this kind of style of a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.310 
reason why I get this kind of style of a
trailer<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.020> because<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.830> these<00:02:47.950> walls<00:02:49.320> some

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
trailer is because of these walls some

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.420 
trailer is because of these walls some
of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> other<00:02:51.250> trailers<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.880> not<00:02:52.060> double<00:02:53.430> you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
of the other trailers to not double you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.680 
of the other trailers to not double you
know<00:02:54.460> they're<00:02:54.640> not<00:02:54.730> double<00:02:55.090> insulated<00:02:55.450> these

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
know they're not double insulated these

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.050 
know they're not double insulated these
are<00:02:55.840> double<00:02:56.170> insulated<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.520> these<00:02:57.670> are<00:02:57.850> pretty

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
are double insulated so these are pretty

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.050 
are double insulated so these are pretty
cool<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.800> stubs<00:03:00.070> are<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.850> think

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
cool and the stubs are actually I think

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.199 
cool and the stubs are actually I think
they're<00:03:01.470> sixteen<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.650> two<00:03:02.800> feet<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.160> center<00:03:03.310> so

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
they're sixteen or two feet on center so

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.699 
they're sixteen or two feet on center so
it's<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.480> little<00:03:04.600> bit<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.989> some<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> other

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
it's a little bit of some of the other

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.979 
it's a little bit of some of the other
