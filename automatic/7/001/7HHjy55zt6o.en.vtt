00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.110
 to 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 Question 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.880
 how long you could live 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 without the adult stem cells 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.550
 answer 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.550
 Not that much 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.970
 if adult stem cells would accelerate 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.070
 the constant decomposition of your 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.590
 tissue organs and glands 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 dramatically reaching a result 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.470
 end of life fortunately now 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.360
 these supposed master cells that 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.030
 they are flowing through your torrent 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.729
 blood replacing damaged cells or 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.759
 dead in your heart your brain the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.399
 liver your muscles the tissue of the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.830
 nerve and the list goes on 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.259
 you probably did not know that this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 natural renewal process continues 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.220
 every second of every day these cells 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 hair grows the skin and eyelashes 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.539
 they fix the cut finger and your broken arm 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.310
 repair and maintenance cells 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.789
 adult mother in the bloodstream 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.060
 more repair renovation and 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.550
 rejuvenation that simple in the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.460
 next few minutes you will hear something even more 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.500
 surprising how you can optimize the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.170
 system of natural renewal of your 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.869
 body adult stem cells 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 for your well-being stress factors 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.340
 environmental and the process of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 aging seriously diminish the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 effectiveness and the number of stem cells 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 adults in circulation this decreases their 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.850
 protection and makes you susceptible to challenges 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.459
 significant for health that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.160
 will impact your quality of life now 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 medical science is spending huge 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.870
 sums of money investigating how 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.819
 improve the use of stem cells to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.400
 treat virtually all 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.040
 diseases this is the future hope 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.530
 of stem cell medicine like this 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
 what can you do now to defend yourself 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.150

 of natural renewal of your body to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.980
 through nutrition of stem cells 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 you can choose technology based on 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.959
 science to impact today's health 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.239
 use nature to do what 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.370
 better does it provide you with compounds

 optimal health and defend yourself against 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.050
 Havoc of stress environmental factors 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.020
 and aging is true 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.820
 and to your health in your life, imagine 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.520
 help the natural renewal system 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.710
 of your body to release more stem cells 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.260
 adults and then maintain those 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.480
 adult stem cells circulating and 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.740
 repairing in your body for hours 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.310
 even when you are sleeping if you can 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.400
 naturally we all have stem cells 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.220
 we all all use stem cells all 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.069
 the days we all use stem cells 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.790
 everyday 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.450
 and the stem cells work 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.640
 and they work every day 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.400
 that's why the stem cells are the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 resistance key for me is the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.680
 leader of nutritional supplements 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.660
 without a doubt what is one time that 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.849
 it could be a product thing that 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.700
 make in the body a wide variety of 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.319
 effects so for many years it was 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.900
 a mystery until the beginning of the year 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.209
 2000 with the discovery of the role of 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.980
 the mother cell in the body but all 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.500
 What I can say is that we have more 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.650
 beyond all we expected is 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.599
 truly a game changer 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.849
 existing the nutrition company of the 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.610
 stem cell offers a complete line 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.370
 of clinically documented products 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.920
 to support the circulation proliferation 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.130
 migration and release of cells 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.850
 adult mother the results one more 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.280
 young and vibrant you have been a doctor 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.380

 changing the life of the reasons the of 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
 stem cells is a hope for the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.450
 future the nutrition of stem cells and 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.450
 is here now and ready to change you
