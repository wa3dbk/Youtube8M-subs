00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.630 

and<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.659> shims<00:01:12.070> we're<00:01:13.070> going<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.280> say<00:01:13.430> those

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
and the shims we're going to say those

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.980 
and the shims we're going to say those
are<00:01:13.790> reusing<00:01:14.270> because<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:14.600> using<00:01:14.750> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
are reusing because we're using the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.050 
are reusing because we're using the
original<00:01:15.130> brake<00:01:16.130> pads<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.580> they<00:01:16.700> don't<00:01:16.880> come

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
original brake pads and they don't come

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
original brake pads and they don't come
with<00:01:17.210> shims<00:01:17.479> shims<00:01:17.990> are<00:01:18.140> sold<00:01:18.350> separately

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
with shims shims are sold separately

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.830 
with shims shims are sold separately
okay<00:01:21.610> then<00:01:21.790> next<00:01:22.000> we're<00:01:22.180> going<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.360> remove<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
okay then next we're going to remove the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080 
okay then next we're going to remove the
caliper<00:01:23.170> there's<00:01:23.980> two<00:01:24.190> seventeen<00:01:24.670> millimeter

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
caliper there's two seventeen millimeter

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.660 
caliper there's two seventeen millimeter
bolts<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.540> are<00:01:25.600> mounting<00:01:26.050> on<00:01:26.200> your<00:01:26.670> filter

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
bolts that are mounting on your filter

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.330 
bolts that are mounting on your filter
on<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.140> plugin<00:01:29.140> meal<00:01:29.320> pretty<00:01:29.590> tight<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.130> use<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
on a plugin meal pretty tight so I use a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.120 
on a plugin meal pretty tight so I use a
breaker<00:01:30.730> bar<00:01:36.840> okay<00:01:37.840> then<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.920> make<00:01:39.100> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
breaker bar okay then just to make it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.730 
breaker bar okay then just to make it
easy<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.600> set<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.750> caliper<00:01:41.170> side<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:41.560> gotta

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
easy to set the caliper side we gotta

00:01:41.740 --> 00:02:07.510 
easy to set the caliper side we gotta
take<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.940> 12<00:01:43.720> millimeter<00:01:44.200> bolt<00:01:44.470> out

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.609 

so<00:02:08.030> putting<00:02:08.270> on<00:02:08.420> brand-new<00:02:08.810> rotors<00:02:09.259> here<00:02:09.440> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
so putting on brand-new rotors here and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.160 
so putting on brand-new rotors here and
they<00:02:09.679> have<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.060> oily<00:02:11.060> film<00:02:11.390> on<00:02:11.690> them<00:02:11.870> when

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
they have this oily film on them when

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.350 
they have this oily film on them when
they<00:02:12.260> come<00:02:12.440> out<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.770> package<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.430> I'm

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
they come out of the package so I'm

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360 
they come out of the package so I'm
gonna<00:02:14.570> clean<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.410> off<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:16.010> don't<00:02:16.190> have

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
gonna clean that off so we don't have

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.510 
gonna clean that off so we don't have
any<00:02:16.550> issues<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.950> pads<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
any issues with the the pads and the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.220 
any issues with the the pads and the
rotors<00:02:19.910> when<00:02:20.180> once<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:20.690> get<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.890> enough

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.810 

using<00:02:27.230> acetone<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.830> clean<00:02:27.980> off<00:02:28.459> that's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
using acetone to clean off that's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.030 
using acetone to clean off that's
probably<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.900> much<00:02:30.080> other<00:02:30.320> ways<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.709> can<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:30.890> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
probably a much other ways you can do it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:54.729 
probably a much other ways you can do it
too

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.610 

okay<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.819> caliper<00:02:56.569> mounting<00:02:56.719> bolts<00:02:57.500> here

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
okay so the caliper mounting bolts here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.170 
okay so the caliper mounting bolts here
pretty<00:02:57.950> rusted<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.609> don't<00:02:58.760> want<00:02:58.879> them<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
pretty rusted we don't want them to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.740 
pretty rusted we don't want them to
seize<00:02:59.480> up<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.469> soon<00:03:00.799> put<00:03:01.010> anti-seize<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
seize up so soon put anti-seize on the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.610 
seize up so soon put anti-seize on the
threads<00:03:03.109> and<00:03:03.409> then<00:03:04.370> rust<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.849> area<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> they

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
threads and then rust the area so they

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.349 
threads and then rust the area so they
don't<00:03:06.769> get<00:03:06.859> locked<00:03:07.129> up<00:03:07.310> later<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:08.269> the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
don't get locked up later on for the

00:03:08.359 --> 00:04:05.100 
don't get locked up later on for the
next<00:03:08.599> round

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.920 

okay<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.170> we<00:04:06.440> want<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.800> use<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.720> reuse<00:04:08.720> the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
okay so we want to use the reuse the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.220 
okay so we want to use the reuse the
shims<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.850> these<00:04:10.850> ones<00:04:11.120> are<00:04:11.420> original<00:04:11.990> but

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
shims and these ones are original but

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.710 
shims and these ones are original but
they<00:04:12.890> fit<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.520> same<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.090> taking<00:04:14.480> all<00:04:14.540> the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
they fit just the same so taking all the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.080 
they fit just the same so taking all the
old<00:04:14.750> pads<00:04:15.400> transferring<00:04:16.400> them<00:04:16.519> onto<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.940> new

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
old pads transferring them onto the new

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.840 
old pads transferring them onto the new
ones<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.470> put<00:04:18.739> some<00:04:20.920> anti<00:04:21.920> squeal<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.580> there

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
ones and put some anti squeal on there

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:38.300 
ones and put some anti squeal on there
too<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.080> case

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.860

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.110 
we got to open up the pistons here I
already<00:05:23.050> did<00:05:23.169> one<00:05:23.199> side<00:05:23.680> but<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:24.249> don't<00:05:25.029> have

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
already did one side but I don't have

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.850 
already did one side but I don't have
any<00:05:25.270> special<00:05:25.599> tools<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:26.229> was<00:05:26.349> going<00:05:26.529> to<00:05:26.589> prime

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.690 

yep<00:05:49.490> all<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.600> way<00:05:50.960> okay<00:05:51.890> now<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.100> Pistons<00:05:52.580> are

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
yep all the way okay now the Pistons are

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.400 
yep all the way okay now the Pistons are
spread<00:05:53.000> out<00:05:53.030> when<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.360> put<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.750> new<00:05:53.900> pads<00:05:54.170> in

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
spread out when I put the new pads in

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.000 
spread out when I put the new pads in
with<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.770> shims<00:05:55.070> on<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.700> with<00:05:55.850> some<00:05:57.010> anti

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
with the shims on and with some anti

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.360 
with the shims on and with some anti
squeal<00:05:58.370> on<00:05:58.610> there<00:05:59.620> then<00:06:00.620> we<00:06:00.770> have<00:06:00.890> just<00:06:01.100> line

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
squeal on there then we have just line

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.120 
squeal on there then we have just line
them<00:06:01.490> up<00:06:01.640> so<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.210> pin<00:06:02.830> goes<00:06:03.830> back

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
them up so that the pin goes back

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.380 
them up so that the pin goes back
through<00:06:04.520> I'm<00:06:04.730> going<00:06:04.850> to<00:06:04.970> loop<00:06:05.150> all<00:06:05.360> the

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
through I'm going to loop all the

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.230 
through I'm going to loop all the
contact<00:06:06.050> points<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:07.280> because<00:06:07.400> I<00:06:07.940> want<00:06:08.150> to

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
contact points just because I want to

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.020 
contact points just because I want to
minimize<00:06:08.450> any<00:06:08.810> chance<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.410> noise<00:06:09.710> or

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
minimize any chance of noise or

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.830 
minimize any chance of noise or
squealing<00:06:11.030> or<00:06:11.390> anything

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:23.059 

Oh

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.050 

okay<00:06:24.069> we're<00:06:24.219> going<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.400> put<00:06:24.520> this<00:06:24.610> retainer

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
okay we're going to put this retainer

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.869 
okay we're going to put this retainer
and<00:06:25.300> got<00:06:25.539> one<00:06:25.780> pin<00:06:26.020> in<00:06:26.229> then<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.370> second<00:06:27.729> pin

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879 
and got one pin in then the second pin

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.390 
and got one pin in then the second pin
will<00:06:28.030> hold<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.300> retainer<00:06:28.659> down<00:06:29.159> so<00:06:30.159> I'm<00:06:30.219> just

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
will hold the retainer down so I'm just

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.999 
will hold the retainer down so I'm just
going<00:06:30.580> to<00:06:30.870> get<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.110> in<00:06:32.349> all<00:06:33.009> the<00:06:33.159> way<00:06:33.250> across

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
going to get that in all the way across

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.659 
going to get that in all the way across
here<00:06:36.009> we<00:06:36.159> go<00:06:36.930> then<00:06:37.930> we're<00:06:38.319> gonna<00:06:38.409> put<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.860> wire

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
here we go then we're gonna put the wire

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.170 
here we go then we're gonna put the wire
back<00:06:40.000> in<00:06:40.889> and<00:06:41.889> you've<00:06:42.310> got<00:06:42.490> a<00:06:42.520> twist<00:06:42.819> pin<00:06:43.150> a

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
back in and you've got a twist pin a

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.600 
back in and you've got a twist pin a
little<00:06:43.539> maybe<00:06:43.689> to<00:06:44.469> get<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.680> hold<00:06:45.039> and<00:06:45.189> line<00:06:45.370> up

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
little maybe to get the hold and line up

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:59.200 
little maybe to get the hold and line up
right

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.900 

there<00:07:00.210> we<00:07:00.360> go<00:07:00.800> it's<00:07:01.800> all<00:07:01.950> locked<00:07:02.130> into<00:07:02.400> place

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
there we go it's all locked into place

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.930 
there we go it's all locked into place
now<00:07:03.360> that<00:07:03.600> the<00:07:03.720> pads<00:07:03.990> are<00:07:04.320> locked<00:07:05.220> in<00:07:05.460> and<00:07:05.880> we

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
now that the pads are locked in and we

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.690 
now that the pads are locked in and we
tighten<00:07:06.420> down<00:07:06.480> the<00:07:06.930> caliper<00:07:07.560> bolts<00:07:07.950> last

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
tighten down the caliper bolts last

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.660 
tighten down the caliper bolts last
thing<00:07:08.970> is<00:07:09.150> just<00:07:09.330> to<00:07:09.570> get<00:07:10.320> the<00:07:10.440> brake<00:07:10.680> hose<00:07:10.920> bolt

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
thing is just to get the brake hose bolt

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.510 
thing is just to get the brake hose bolt
in<00:07:11.880> and<00:07:12.870> then<00:07:13.140> that's<00:07:13.380> going<00:07:13.590> to<00:07:13.650> begin<00:07:16.400> put<00:07:17.400> on

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
in and then that's going to begin put on

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.310 
in and then that's going to begin put on
the<00:07:17.640> wheel<00:07:17.820> torque<00:07:18.210> it<00:07:18.330> down<00:07:21.140> okay<00:07:22.140> well

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
the wheel torque it down okay well

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.010 
the wheel torque it down okay well
you're<00:07:22.440> spreading<00:07:22.740> open<00:07:23.070> the<00:07:23.480> pistons<00:07:24.480> on<00:07:24.780> the

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
you're spreading open the pistons on the

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.960 
you're spreading open the pistons on the
calipers<00:07:25.440> make<00:07:26.100> sure<00:07:26.250> and<00:07:26.370> watch<00:07:26.490> the<00:07:26.700> level

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
calipers make sure and watch the level

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.370 
calipers make sure and watch the level
on<00:07:27.090> the<00:07:27.210> brake<00:07:27.390> fluid<00:07:27.420> you<00:07:27.990> don't<00:07:28.140> want<00:07:28.260> to

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
on the brake fluid you don't want to

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.540 
on the brake fluid you don't want to
overflow

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
overflow

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.330 
overflow
typically<00:07:30.270> you<00:07:31.050> don't<00:07:31.170> shouldn't<00:07:32.130> be<00:07:32.190> adding

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
typically you don't shouldn't be adding

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.510 
typically you don't shouldn't be adding
brake<00:07:32.670> fluid<00:07:33.060> when<00:07:34.050> it<00:07:34.170> gets<00:07:34.350> down<00:07:34.560> as<00:07:34.890> a<00:07:34.950> pads

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
brake fluid when it gets down as a pads

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.460 
brake fluid when it gets down as a pads
wear<00:07:35.760> out<00:07:35.970> it's<00:07:36.240> gonna<00:07:36.420> go<00:07:36.630> down<00:07:36.810> and<00:07:37.200> then<00:07:37.320> we

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
wear out it's gonna go down and then we

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.430 
wear out it's gonna go down and then we
had<00:07:37.650> put<00:07:37.980> new<00:07:38.100> pads<00:07:38.370> it<00:07:38.550> goes<00:07:38.760> back<00:07:39.000> up<00:07:39.440> so

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
had put new pads it goes back up so

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.900 
had put new pads it goes back up so
anyways<00:07:40.800> and<00:07:41.010> then<00:07:41.130> also<00:07:41.520> one<00:07:41.670> other<00:07:41.700> thing

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
anyways and then also one other thing

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.810 
anyways and then also one other thing
we're<00:07:42.900> gonna<00:07:42.990> do<00:07:43.230> is<00:07:43.260> pump<00:07:44.100> the<00:07:44.280> brake<00:07:44.460> pedal

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820 
we're gonna do is pump the brake pedal

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.100 
we're gonna do is pump the brake pedal
so<00:07:45.030> that<00:07:45.210> the<00:07:45.390> pads<00:07:45.980> seat<00:07:46.980> into<00:07:47.250> place<00:07:47.490> and<00:07:48.110> so

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.110 
so that the pads seat into place and so

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.930 
so that the pads seat into place and so
the<00:07:49.200> pedal<00:07:49.500> doesn't<00:07:49.680> drop<00:07:49.890> to<00:07:50.100> the<00:07:50.190> floor<00:07:50.370> when

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 
the pedal doesn't drop to the floor when

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:59.240 
the pedal doesn't drop to the floor when
we<00:07:51.120> go<00:07:51.360> to<00:07:51.420> drive<00:07:52.200> away

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250
