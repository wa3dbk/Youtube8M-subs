00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
those sizes has some coordinating ranges

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.109 
those sizes has some coordinating ranges
on<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.820> example<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> large<00:00:26.430> variant<00:00:26.910> brim

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
has 59 to 60 3 centimeters well what

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.990 
has 59 to 60 3 centimeters well what
does<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.300> mean<00:00:30.769> okay<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.189> basically<00:00:32.730> what

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
back and look and let's see I'm about a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
back and look and let's see I'm about a
fifty<00:00:52.350> four<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> half<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.280> fifty<00:00:53.579> five

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
fifty four and a half of fifty five

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
fifty four and a half of fifty five
so<00:00:54.780> obviously<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> large<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.010> too

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so obviously the large is gonna be too

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.410 
so obviously the large is gonna be too
big<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.520> me<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
big for me that's kind of where you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510 
big for me that's kind of where you
start<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.920> measurement<00:00:59.370> like

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
start you take your measurement like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
start you take your measurement like
that<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> match<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that and then you match it up with the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
that and then you match it up with the
range<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
range that you're gonna be in for the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
range that you're gonna be in for the
helmet<00:01:03.120> sizing<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> according<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> Smith<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
helmet sizing so according to Smith a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
helmet sizing so according to Smith a
medium<00:01:07.650> helmet<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.700> Smith<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> variant

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
medium helmet by Smith is in the variant

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.870 
medium helmet by Smith is in the variant
medium<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.990> 55<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.170> 59<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.009> since<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.549> fifty

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
medium is 55 to 59 and since I was fifty

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670 
medium is 55 to 59 and since I was fifty
four<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> half<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.320> push<00:01:19.470> me<00:01:19.650> out

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
four and a half that would push me out

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
four and a half that would push me out
of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> small<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.880> end<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> medium<00:01:21.570> range

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of the small the end of the medium range

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
of the small the end of the medium range
so<00:01:22.590> obviously<00:01:23.040> looking<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so obviously looking at that there's a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
so obviously looking at that there's a
lot<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.540> range<00:01:24.720> within<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> medium<00:01:25.500> 50<00:01:25.890> let's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
lot of range within the medium 50 let's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
lot of range within the medium 50 let's
say<00:01:26.850> 55<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> 59<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
say 55 to 59 so I just want to show you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
say 55 to 59 so I just want to show you
I've<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.850> three<00:01:30.119> different<00:01:30.240> variant<00:01:30.780> brim

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I've got three different variant brim

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
I've got three different variant brim
helmets<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.770> small<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.909> medium<00:01:33.329> one

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
helmets here one small one medium one

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
helmets here one small one medium one
large<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> show

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
large and I just kind of want to show

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
large and I just kind of want to show
you<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> different<00:01:35.549> fits<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you the different fits so this is the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
you the different fits so this is the
small<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:39.450> small<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.650> imperium<00:01:41.130> fit

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
small and the small very imperium fit

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.960 
small and the small very imperium fit
say<00:01:42.390> let's<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.500> 51<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> 55<00:01:44.520> Dozier

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
say let's see 51 to 55 Dozier

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
say let's see 51 to 55 Dozier
theoretically<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.590> fit<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.189> I'm

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
theoretically this would fit because I'm

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
theoretically this would fit because I'm
a<00:01:47.430> 55<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> top<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> range<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
a 55 but that's the top of the range and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780 
a 55 but that's the top of the range and
that's<00:01:49.770> probably<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.130> where<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> want<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> be

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that's probably not where you want to be

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.469 
that's probably not where you want to be
so<00:01:51.450> basically<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.970> BOA

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
so basically you want to take this BOA

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
so basically you want to take this BOA
fit<00:01:54.869> system<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.799> loosen<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
fit system here and loosen it up all the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
fit system here and loosen it up all the
way<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.229> righty-tighty<00:01:58.590> lefty-loosey

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
way and it's righty-tighty lefty-loosey

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.929 
way and it's righty-tighty lefty-loosey
so<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.759> loosening<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> way<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.939> then

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
so I'm loosening up all the way and then

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
so I'm loosening up all the way and then
I<00:02:02.969> put<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> helmet<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> small

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
I put the helmet on now this is a small

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.479 
I put the helmet on now this is a small
so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.930> theoretically<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.710> could<00:02:07.979> wear<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so you know theoretically I could wear a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
so you know theoretically I could wear a
small<00:02:08.970> I've<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> small<00:02:10.170> head<00:02:10.500> but

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
small I've got kind of a small head but

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.979 
small I've got kind of a small head but
when<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.520> put<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> on

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
when I put it on

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.229 
when I put it on
even<00:02:13.890> without<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> strap<00:02:14.489> without<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.030> boa

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
even without the strap without the boa

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.440 
even without the strap without the boa
it's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:16.319> fairly<00:02:16.560> tight<00:02:17.010> fit

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it's a fairly tight fit

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.350 
it's a fairly tight fit
I<00:02:18.480> actually<00:02:19.110> wiggle<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.000> it'll<00:02:21.000> move<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
I actually wiggle it and it'll move the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.509 
I actually wiggle it and it'll move the
skin<00:02:21.599> on<00:02:21.780> top<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.079> my<00:02:22.319> head<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.040> problem<00:02:23.400> with

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
skin on top of my head the problem with

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.789 
skin on top of my head the problem with
this<00:02:23.670> even<00:02:24.030> though<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.689> nice<00:02:24.840> tight

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
this even though it's it's a nice tight

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.309 
this even though it's it's a nice tight
fit<00:02:25.829> as<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> feels<00:02:26.700> almost<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:28.110> not

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
fit as it feels almost like it's not

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.509 
fit as it feels almost like it's not
down<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.099> way<00:02:29.629> so<00:02:30.629> for<00:02:31.349> me<00:02:31.530> even<00:02:32.280> though<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
down all the way so for me even though I

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.190 
down all the way so for me even though I
could<00:02:32.879> do<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> small<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.780> I'm<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.110> very

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
could do a small because I'm at the very

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.460 
could do a small because I'm at the very
top<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.709> range<00:02:34.890> I'm<00:02:35.579> gonna<00:02:35.760> jump<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.209> to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
top of the range I'm gonna jump up to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.710 
top of the range I'm gonna jump up to
medium<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> again<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> take<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.150> BOA<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
medium so again I take the BOA and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.990 
medium so again I take the BOA and
release<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.290> all<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.560> way<00:02:43.849> mmm

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
release it all the way mmm

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.800 
release it all the way mmm
slide<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.510> helmet<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.819> okay<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.569> now<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
slide the helmet on okay so now the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.720 
slide the helmet on okay so now the
helmet<00:02:49.260> actually<00:02:49.680> feels<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> go<00:02:50.579> on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
helmet actually feels like you can go on

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.470 
helmet actually feels like you can go on
my<00:02:50.940> head<00:02:51.769> when<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.799> wiggle<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.970> tight

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
my head when I wiggle it it's tight

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
my head when I wiggle it it's tight
enough<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.859> know<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.459> going

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
enough so that you know it's not going

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.789 
enough so that you know it's not going
to<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.849> sloppy<00:02:57.180> fit<00:02:57.480> at<00:02:57.599> all<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.409> actually

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
to be a sloppy fit at all I can actually

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.979 
to be a sloppy fit at all I can actually
then<00:02:59.010> tighten<00:02:59.909> up<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.180> BOA<00:03:00.389> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> back<00:03:01.609> and

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
then tighten up the BOA in the back and

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.710 
then tighten up the BOA in the back and
when<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.019> do<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:04.879> what<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:06.000> does<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.480> really

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
when I do that what it does is it really

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.809 
when I do that what it does is it really
cinches<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> helmet<00:03:07.950> actually<00:03:08.459> from<00:03:08.639> the

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
cinches in the helmet actually from the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.949 
cinches in the helmet actually from the
back<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.810> kind<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.230> pushes<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.760> helmet<00:03:12.120> fills

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
back it kind of pushes the helmet fills

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.530 
back it kind of pushes the helmet fills
in<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.170> back<00:03:13.379> space<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.099> pulls<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.209> front<00:03:15.450> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
in the back space and pulls the front of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.750 
in the back space and pulls the front of
the<00:03:15.599> helmet<00:03:15.720> back<00:03:15.989> towards<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.579> now

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580 
the helmet back towards you so right now
I<00:03:18.030> actually<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.599> helmet<00:03:18.959> moves<00:03:19.169> with<00:03:19.410> me

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
I actually the helmet moves with me

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.159 
I actually the helmet moves with me
there's<00:03:19.799> no<00:03:20.010> slop<00:03:20.340> whatsoever<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.959> then<00:03:22.079> I

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
there's no slop whatsoever and then I

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.640 
there's no slop whatsoever and then I
tighten<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.769> chinstrap<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:24.199> and<00:03:25.199> I<00:03:25.379> have

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
tighten up the chinstrap here and I have

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.409 
tighten up the chinstrap here and I have
a<00:03:25.680> helmet<00:03:26.099> actually<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.819> chin<00:03:27.000> straps<00:03:27.299> a

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
a helmet actually the chin straps a

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.210 
a helmet actually the chin straps a
little<00:03:27.629> bit<00:03:27.750> too<00:03:27.900> tight<00:03:28.139> but<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:29.010> helmet

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
little bit too tight but the helmet

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.270 
little bit too tight but the helmet
itself<00:03:29.790> fits<00:03:30.209> very<00:03:30.989> well<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.859> way<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.040> want

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
itself fits very well the way you want

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.379 
itself fits very well the way you want
your<00:03:32.370> helmet<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.699> fit<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:32.970> want<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.239> to

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
your helmet to fit you want it to

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.199 
your helmet to fit you want it to
actually<00:03:33.889> without<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.069> strap<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.819> you<00:03:36.030> want

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
actually without the strap on you want

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.390 
actually without the strap on you want
to<00:03:36.269> tighten<00:03:36.449> up<00:03:36.629> so<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.079> can<00:03:37.230> actually

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
to tighten up so that you can actually

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.039 
to tighten up so that you can actually
kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.489> move<00:03:38.639> your<00:03:38.760> head<00:03:38.940> around<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
kind of move your head around and it's

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.720 
kind of move your head around and it's
not<00:03:40.199> gonna<00:03:40.319> fall<00:03:40.560> off<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.010> helmet<00:03:41.190> moves<00:03:41.489> with

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
not gonna fall off the helmet moves with

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.159 
not gonna fall off the helmet moves with
you<00:03:41.940> no<00:03:42.359> slop<00:03:42.859> if<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:44.040> were<00:03:44.160> actually<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:45.109> go<00:03:46.109> to

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
you no slop if I were actually to go to

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.159 
you no slop if I were actually to go to
a<00:03:46.230> large<00:03:46.590> which<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.669> think<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.599> said<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.959> large

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
a large which I think I said the large

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.689 
a large which I think I said the large
range<00:03:49.560> here<00:03:49.949> was<00:03:50.540> let's<00:03:51.540> see<00:03:51.889> and<00:03:52.889> then<00:03:53.040> 59<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
range here was let's see and then 59 to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.259 
range here was let's see and then 59 to
63<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:55.430> bottom<00:03:56.430> measurement<00:03:57.150> is

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
63 so this is the bottom measurement is

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.720 
63 so this is the bottom measurement is
4<00:03:57.449> centimeters<00:03:58.109> in<00:03:58.199> my<00:03:58.290> head<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.799> listen<00:03:59.639> up

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
4 centimeters in my head so listen up

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.330 
4 centimeters in my head so listen up
above<00:04:00.000> strap<00:04:00.389> here<00:04:00.629> then<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.889> this<00:04:02.040> large

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
above strap here then I go to this large

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.270 
above strap here then I go to this large
and<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:02.909> you<00:04:03.419> can<00:04:03.569> see<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:04.440> totally<00:04:04.709> sloppy

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and it's you can see it's totally sloppy

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.819 
and it's you can see it's totally sloppy
on<00:04:05.609> me<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:06.060> mean<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.750> possible<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.650> with

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
on me I mean it is possible that with

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.119 
on me I mean it is possible that with
the<00:04:08.069> BOA<00:04:08.250> strap<00:04:08.639> that<00:04:09.479> I<00:04:09.540> could<00:04:10.129> potentially

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
the BOA strap that I could potentially

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.759 
the BOA strap that I could potentially
tighten<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.329> lot<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.900> still<00:04:13.079> even<00:04:13.590> then

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
tighten it up a lot but still even then

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.279 
tighten it up a lot but still even then
there's<00:04:14.699> still<00:04:14.970> some<00:04:15.209> slop<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:15.900> helmet

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
there's still some slop in this helmet

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.459 
there's still some slop in this helmet
so<00:04:17.120> again<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:21.060> small<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.539> medium<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:21.959> large<00:04:22.200> I

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
so again the small to medium and large I

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.950 
so again the small to medium and large I
can<00:04:22.620> all<00:04:22.800> sort<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.520> work<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> small

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
can all sort of make work but the small

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.000 
can all sort of make work but the small
feels<00:04:25.229> like<00:04:25.409> it<00:04:25.530> wants<00:04:25.620> to

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
feels like it wants to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.860 
feels like it wants to
and<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.580> large<00:04:26.760> has<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> lot<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> slop<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.720> it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
and the large has a lot of slop in it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
and the large has a lot of slop in it
the<00:04:28.320> medium<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.770> perfect<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.370> again<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.700> start

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the medium is perfect so again you start

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.210 
the medium is perfect so again you start
with<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.270> measurement<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:31.620> centimeters

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
with your measurement in centimeters

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.120 
with your measurement in centimeters
around<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.610> widest<00:04:32.910> part<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.210> your<00:04:33.330> head<00:04:34.130> then

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
around the widest part of your head then

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.250 
around the widest part of your head then
you<00:04:35.250> put<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.520> helmet<00:04:35.670> on<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.240> generally<00:04:37.170> you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
you put the helmet on and generally you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.680 
you put the helmet on and generally you
want<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.500> be<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.340> know<00:04:38.460> not<00:04:38.850> at<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> top<00:04:39.360> or

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
want to be you know not at the top or

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.660 
want to be you know not at the top or
the<00:04:39.720> bottom<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.680> centimeter<00:04:41.130> range<00:04:41.430> that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
the bottom of the centimeter range that

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.800 
the bottom of the centimeter range that
they<00:04:41.790> give<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.090> want<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> be<00:04:42.420> somewhere<00:04:42.750> in

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
they give you want to be somewhere in

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.540 
they give you want to be somewhere in
the<00:04:42.930> middle<00:04:43.230> again<00:04:43.650> I'm<00:04:44.010> kind<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.340> tough<00:04:44.520> one

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
the middle again I'm kind of a tough one

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.180 
the middle again I'm kind of a tough one
because<00:04:44.850> I'm<00:04:45.270> right<00:04:45.900> I'm<00:04:46.200> at<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.920> highest

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
because I'm right I'm at the highest

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.760 
because I'm right I'm at the highest
setting<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.750> small<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.470> lowest

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
setting of the the small and the lowest

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.010 
setting of the the small and the lowest
set<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.070> meet<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.490> medium<00:04:50.850> so<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.630> went

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
set of the meet of the medium so I went

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.210 
set of the meet of the medium so I went
with<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.230> medium<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.740> use<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.040> boa

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
with the medium and use the boa

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.610 
with the medium and use the boa
constrictor

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
constrictor

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.680 
constrictor
dial<00:04:55.620> back<00:04:55.830> here<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.790> really<00:04:57.060> take<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.450> some<00:04:57.660> of

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
dial back here to really take in some of

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.540 
dial back here to really take in some of
the<00:04:57.810> volume<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.290> helmet<00:04:58.650> basically<00:04:59.430> you

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
the volume of the helmet basically you

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.570 
the volume of the helmet basically you
want<00:04:59.760> your<00:04:59.820> helmet<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.330> be<00:05:00.710> snug<00:05:01.710> fitting<00:05:02.100> not

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
want your helmet to be snug fitting not

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.900 
want your helmet to be snug fitting not
so<00:05:02.850> tight<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.330> causes<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.840> any<00:05:03.870> pain<00:05:04.910> but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
so tight that it causes you any pain but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.690 
so tight that it causes you any pain but
you<00:05:06.390> know<00:05:06.990> not<00:05:07.260> loose<00:05:07.620> enough<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.670> can

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
you know not loose enough so that it can

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.070 
you know not loose enough so that it can
slop<00:05:09.090> around<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.630> fall<00:05:09.780> off<00:05:09.960> because

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
slop around and fall off because

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.710 
slop around and fall off because
basically<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.800> don't<00:05:10.890> want<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:12.660> a

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
basically you don't want to have in in a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.090 
basically you don't want to have in in a
situation<00:05:12.900> where<00:05:13.290> you<00:05:13.380> hit<00:05:13.590> your<00:05:13.710> helmet<00:05:14.040> you

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
situation where you hit your helmet you

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.620 
situation where you hit your helmet you
don't<00:05:14.250> want<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.490> have<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.760> helmet<00:05:15.060> hit<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
don't want to have the helmet hit and

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.000 
don't want to have the helmet hit and
then<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.900> secondary<00:05:16.410> hit<00:05:16.650> with<00:05:16.740> your<00:05:16.830> head

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
then have a secondary hit with your head

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.620 
then have a secondary hit with your head
you<00:05:17.160> want<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.520> helmet<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.210> head<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.510> be

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
you want the helmet and the head to be

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.480 
you want the helmet and the head to be
together<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.530> when<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.710> helmet<00:05:19.890> takes<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> hit

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
together so when the helmet takes a hit

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.760 
together so when the helmet takes a hit
your<00:05:21.150> head<00:05:21.300> actually<00:05:21.480> is<00:05:21.750> already<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.410> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
your head actually is already on the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.970 
your head actually is already on the
protective<00:05:23.190> membrane<00:05:23.490> inside<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.910> helmet<00:05:24.980> in

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
protective membrane inside the helmet in

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.950 
protective membrane inside the helmet in
general<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.670> think<00:05:26.790> that<00:05:27.090> it's<00:05:27.750> pretty

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
general I think that it's pretty

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.200 
general I think that it's pretty
straightforward<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.860> if<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:29.760> need<00:05:29.940> help

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
straightforward and if you need help

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.540 
straightforward and if you need help
with<00:05:30.570> fitting<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.500> need<00:05:31.620> any<00:05:31.830> hints<00:05:32.220> clues

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
with fitting you need any hints clues

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.550 
with fitting you need any hints clues
