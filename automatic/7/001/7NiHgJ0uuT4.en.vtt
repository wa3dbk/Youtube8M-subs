00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.280
 hello guys today we won't 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.840
 my head is complicated by experiments 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.400
 because the moment is shorter not 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 confused money even for travel 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 it is the secret materials new speech is not about 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.890
 tom will talk about us 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.560
 while saving water is heavy 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.349
 financial position 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 show the counter here the counter we have it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.260
 We react to the magnet if they are 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.530
 ordinary counter bring a magnet 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 behind or in front of us 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.510
 stops this counter shorter on 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.489
 magnet communication how does not affect here you 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 let us show which side a Vulcan is often 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 besides the top we show which side 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 I spend the twist here what kind of notes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.470
 the side goes counter clockwise a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 sweet ass hot tap we close eat 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 such a thing we take a cloth put it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 down because our little 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.890
 some water will run on top open the filter 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 he always comes from above now 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:34.409
 open honestly for this not yet 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:41.360
 until the filter we open our Vodicka 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.360
 run right now it is flowing there 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.160
 Well, in theory, you can open the tap with 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.330
 water but since i have such a thing 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.630
 what is the name of the filter with the hose and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 others much here it will be 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 unscrew 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 Now you understand why all the case 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 all the water we have offended here we have water 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.050
 no next next most interesting ready 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.050
 forest cleaner 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980
 a tray could filter 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:58.319
 see need to help everything works well 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.769
 And in the opposite direction 2 types of clock 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.769
 More 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.330
 reading too much cheeks look 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:16.910
 ideally correct here with such 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 Trends still water energy account in debt 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.800
 drive all the way around spinning 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.800
 perfect 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.810
 the main thing is not to overdo it because too 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.810
 fast can't 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.159
 here and so just right for all the Th 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.409
 damn work we see so yourself how good 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.409
 or in the opposite direction 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:03.090
 roughly speaking 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.270
 no magic everything works okay 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.720
 Yes, the next series of 9 money between 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.500
 appear start continue on 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.519
 experiments are good, of course, not so 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.049
 stupid well, I hope that you something 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.049
 maybe maybe thanks bye
