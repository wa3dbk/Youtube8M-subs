00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
down the speedometer and I was you know

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.700 
doing about the right speed in Florida
which<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> limit<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> 70<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.500> right

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
which is the limit is 70 so I was right

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.240 
which is the limit is 70 so I was right
right<00:00:44.010> around<00:00:44.489> 70<00:00:44.969> ish<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.280> I<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:49.590> pulled<00:00:50.129> me

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
right around 70 ish and I just pulled me

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
right around 70 ish and I just pulled me
over<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.879> coming<00:00:51.149> from<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> long<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.809> back

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
over so I'm coming from a long way back

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
over so I'm coming from a long way back
and<00:00:52.699> I<00:00:53.809> had<00:00:54.809> passed<00:00:55.079> him<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:56.340> pulled

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.290 
and I had passed him he had pulled
another<00:00:56.879> truck<00:00:57.710> over<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.879> seem<00:01:00.149> like

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
