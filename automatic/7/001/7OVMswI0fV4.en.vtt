and what you'll find here is what Neeson

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630 
and what you'll find here is what Neeson
calls<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.479> icon<00:01:40.110> system<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.280> looks

with that turbocharged engine

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.860 
with that turbocharged engine
so<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> Juke<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.550> an<00:02:21.730> absolute<00:02:22.209> blast<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
so the Juke is an absolute blast to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.449 
so the Juke is an absolute blast to
drive<00:02:22.900> which<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.560> unusual<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.160> mean<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.430> are

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
drive which is unusual I mean there are

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.479 
drive which is unusual I mean there are
a<00:02:24.580> lot<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> fun<00:02:25.510> compact<00:02:26.290> crossover<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.340> it's

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
a lot of fun compact crossover but it's

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.640 
a lot of fun compact crossover but it's
sort<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> first<00:02:28.290> subcompact<00:02:29.290> crossover

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650

this<00:02:30.280> thing<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> great<00:02:31.000> package<00:02:31.480> that's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
this thing is a great package that's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
this thing is a great package that's
because<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.590> originality<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.610> vehicle

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
because the originality of the vehicle

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.120 
because the originality of the vehicle
extends<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> drivetrain<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:35.980> only

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
extends to the drivetrain so not only

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.300 
extends to the drivetrain so not only
did<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.489> great<00:02:36.790> 6-speed<00:02:37.569> manual<00:02:37.750> transmission

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
did a great 6-speed manual transmission

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.860 
did a great 6-speed manual transmission
which<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.459> amazing<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.420> CVT

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
which is amazing you can also get a CVT

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.380 
which is amazing you can also get a CVT
which<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:42.040> probably<00:02:42.880> isn't<00:02:43.030> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.269> be<00:02:43.330> as

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
which it probably isn't going to be as
