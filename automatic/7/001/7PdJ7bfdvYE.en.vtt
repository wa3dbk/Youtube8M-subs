Today's episode is sponsored by TokyoFlash Japan.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.050
Hello there unboxers! This is Sakis Karpas in another episode of Unboxholics.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:42.000
Today we will unboxing something quite different and special. This product comes from the "The Land of The Rising Sun" and it promises that it will change the way we look at time.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.500
The retail package is small, simple and beautiful. The first thing we find inside is a manual that will guide us on how to use Kisai Adjust.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.260
Later on, we find the KIsai Adjust watch which we'll leave aside for now to show you the remaining contents of the package.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.700
1. A USB Cable  2. A warranty card  3. A small bag with a screwdriver and a tiny bolt inside

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.800
We're really curious to see the Kisai Adjust watch in action, so let's start!

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:26.200
Kisai Adjust made an amazing first impression to us with its excellent build quality and the fact that each part of Kisai Adjust has been individually designed and manufactured contributes to its authenticity and reliable quality.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.150
Kisai Adjust's chain as well as the watch itself has a matte texture which was produced via the process of sandblasting and its color seems like teal grey rather than black. Kisai Adjust is also available in silver.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.100
The only physical buttons can be found on its right side that help you control several functions of the watch.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.420
Kisai Adjust features 32 LED triangles that show the digital time.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.700
Although it took me a while to get used to it, people around me were seeing little LED triangles while I could tell what time the watch was displaying.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.100
The time can be viewed in horizontal or vertical mode.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.000
Other functions of Kisai Adjust include a date mode and an alarm mode.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.000
Moreover, Kisai Adjust lets you change the display to one of six vivid colors at the touch of a button.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:41.400
Kisai Adjust has a water resistance of up to 29 meters, it weighs 150 grams and it can be recharged by connecting it to your computer with the USB cable provided.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.450
Overall, this an impressive piece of hardware with a sci-fi aesthetic and a minimal look.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.300
