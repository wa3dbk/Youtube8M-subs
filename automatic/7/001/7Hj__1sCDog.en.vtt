00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
presented in the box like that and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.540 
presented in the box like that and
that's<00:03:58.260> how<00:03:58.470> they<00:03:58.680> would<00:03:58.920> go<00:03:59.130> in<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> carry

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
that's how they would go in the carry

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.390 
that's how they would go in the carry
case<00:03:59.820> now<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> bit<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> tight<00:04:01.709> fit<00:04:01.740> in<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
case now is a bit of a tight fit in the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.920 
case now is a bit of a tight fit in the
carry<00:04:02.640> case<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.270> do<00:04:03.330> get<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.720> there

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
carry case but they do get in there

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.920 
carry case but they do get in there
which<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.830> as<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:05.490> I<00:04:05.730> mean<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.900> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
which is as you can see I mean it is a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.949 
which is as you can see I mean it is a
little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.620> tight<00:04:07.830> fit<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.630> had<00:04:09.750> any

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
little bit of a tight fit if I had any

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.690 
little bit of a tight fit if I had any
anything<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.860> say<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> would<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.370> make<00:04:11.580> the

anything to say it would be make the
carry<00:04:12.270> case<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.720> larger<00:04:13.110> but<00:04:13.709> they<00:04:13.800> do<00:04:13.860> get

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
carry case a bit larger but they do get

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.560 
carry case a bit larger but they do get
in<00:04:14.250> they're<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.850> gonna<00:04:14.970> trucks<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.390> might

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570

white color which is superb as well I

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.030

went<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.570> black<00:05:00.780> because<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.710> won't<00:05:01.950> get

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
went for the black because it won't get

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.320 
went for the black because it won't get
as<00:05:02.160> dirty<00:05:02.340> as<00:05:02.610> quick<00:05:02.850> I've<00:05:02.970> already<00:05:03.180> got<00:05:03.300> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
as dirty as quick I've already got a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.290 
as dirty as quick I've already got a
white<00:05:03.600> pair<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.900> headphones<00:05:04.250> but<00:05:05.300> another

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
white pair of headphones but another

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300 
white pair of headphones but another
flaw<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:07.020> guess<00:05:07.230> is<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:07.950> doesn't<00:05:08.190> have<00:05:08.280> a

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
flaw I guess is that it doesn't have a

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.510 
flaw I guess is that it doesn't have a
built-in<00:05:08.580> mic<00:05:09.030> now<00:05:09.960> it's<00:05:10.290> just<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:11.100> know<00:05:11.250> it's

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
built-in mic now it's just you know it's

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.520 
built-in mic now it's just you know it's
a<00:05:11.640> little<00:05:12.330> addition<00:05:12.900> that<00:05:12.990> would<00:05:13.170> make<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
a little addition that would make the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.710 
a little addition that would make the
headphones<00:05:13.860> better<00:05:14.130> but<00:05:14.430> yeah<00:05:15.090> it's<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.570> a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
headphones better but yeah it's just a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.870 
headphones better but yeah it's just a
minor<00:05:15.960> thing<00:05:16.260> I<00:05:16.500> would<00:05:16.890> prefer<00:05:17.070> them<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.550> have

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
minor thing I would prefer them to have

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.980 
minor thing I would prefer them to have
have<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> mic<00:05:19.200> but<00:05:19.400> unfortunately<00:05:20.400> of<00:05:20.520> them

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
have a mic but unfortunately of them

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.510 
have a mic but unfortunately of them
also<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.290> want<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.530> talk<00:05:22.710> about<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.310> noise

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
also I want to talk about is the noise

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.090 
also I want to talk about is the noise
isolation<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.450> absolutely<00:05:25.050> brilliant<00:05:25.260> from

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
isolation is absolutely brilliant from

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.470 
isolation is absolutely brilliant from
the<00:05:26.190> moment<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.640> put<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.940> headphones<00:05:27.360> to

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
the moment you put the headphones to

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.470 
the moment you put the headphones to
your<00:05:27.690> on<00:05:28.020> your<00:05:28.290> ears<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:29.670> can<00:05:30.000> barely<00:05:30.360> hear

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
your on your ears you can barely hear

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.180 
your on your ears you can barely hear
much<00:05:30.780> around<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.290> which<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.560> really<00:05:31.830> good<00:05:32.040> and
