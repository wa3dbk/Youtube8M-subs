 much playing with certain being is not 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.790

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 It's like my son, it's a project that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.319
 was born last year in the month of October 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.930
 approximately before that came 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.140
 punishing only through my channel 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.660
 staff of andrew gamers and all that and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.900
 I saw at this moment the need for 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.200
 create some channel I understand is something 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.700
 that represents another community another 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 something I always wanted 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.790

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.180
 characterized by always punishing only not 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.989
 he had a fixed coke of his things and then 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.780

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.050
