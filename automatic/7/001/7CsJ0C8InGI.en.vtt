it<00:00:06.569> just<00:00:06.720> came<00:00:06.839> out<00:00:06.990> today<00:00:07.170> for<00:00:07.500> those<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:08.010> the

it just came out today for those on the
insider<00:00:08.519> program<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.570> overall<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.349> not<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
insider program and overall it's not a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.320 
insider program and overall it's not a
huge<00:00:11.010> change<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> sense<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.059> there<00:00:12.240> are

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
huge change in the sense that there are

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.970 
huge change in the sense that there are
really<00:00:12.509> no<00:00:12.599> new<00:00:12.900> future<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.740> kind

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
really no new future it's it's this kind

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
really no new future it's it's this kind
of<00:00:14.130> future<00:00:14.549> locked<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.750> see<00:00:15.960> those<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
of future locked but we do see those a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.040 
of future locked but we do see those a
big<00:00:16.560> improvement<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.250> terms<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.699> performance

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
big improvement in terms of performance

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.120 
big improvement in terms of performance
one<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> those<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.410> course<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.890> gonna<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
one of those of course it's gonna be a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
one of those of course it's gonna be a
little<00:00:20.279> hard<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:20.880> suppose<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.390> can

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
little hard to see here suppose I can

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
little hard to see here suppose I can
zoom<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> new<00:00:22.529> battery<00:00:22.769> icon<00:00:23.070> which<00:00:23.910> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
zoom in is the new battery icon which is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.460 
zoom in is the new battery icon which is
now<00:00:24.210> larger<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> people<00:00:25.410> are

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now larger so a lot of people are

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.750 
now larger so a lot of people are
complaining<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> previous<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.640> was

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
complaining that the previous one was

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
complaining that the previous one was
too<00:00:26.970> small<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.199> Microsoft<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.740> basically

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
too small and so Microsoft is basically

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
too small and so Microsoft is basically
we<00:00:29.130> turn<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> its<00:00:29.910> previous<00:00:30.269> incarnation

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
we turn it to its previous incarnation

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
we turn it to its previous incarnation
of<00:00:31.380> Windows<00:00:31.710> Phone<00:00:31.859> 8.1<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.550> least<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.149> how

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of Windows Phone 8.1 at least that's how

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
of Windows Phone 8.1 at least that's how
it<00:00:33.360> seems<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.780> other<00:00:34.440> than<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.620> though

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it seems to me other than that though

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.639 
it seems to me other than that though
the<00:00:35.160> OS<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.730> much<00:00:35.969> faster<00:00:36.870> smoother<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the OS is just much faster smoother I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
the OS is just much faster smoother I
know<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.980> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.329> generic<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
know it's kind of you know generic to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
know it's kind of you know generic to
say<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.100> comes<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
say but that's really what comes down to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
say but that's really what comes down to
is<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.420> launched<00:00:42.629> an

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
is you can see here when I launched an

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.770 
is you can see here when I launched an
app<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.140> how<00:00:43.260> quickly<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.739> goes<00:00:44.539> really<00:00:45.539> nice

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
app just how quickly it goes really nice

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
app just how quickly it goes really nice
haven't<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.230> seen<00:00:46.410> any<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.860> resuming

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
haven't really seen any like resuming

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
haven't really seen any like resuming

like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.620> fact<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.449> I'll

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
like that in fact when you want to I'll

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
like that in fact when you want to I'll
do<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.190> news<00:00:53.190> app<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> right

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
do the news app as you can see right

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
do the news app as you can see right
there<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> pull<00:00:56.160> down

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there and now it's going to pull down

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
there and now it's going to pull down
some<00:00:56.460> data<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.030> goes<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.570> from<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
some data and there goes that was from a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.680 
some data and there goes that was from a
clean<00:00:58.199> boot<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.129> nothing

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
clean boot so that was actually nothing

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
clean boot so that was actually nothing
previously<00:01:00.690> loaded<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.590> bitch<00:01:01.770> up

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
previously loaded you can see bitch up

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
previously loaded you can see bitch up
faster<00:01:02.370> storage<00:01:02.699> load<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
faster storage load now some of this is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.700 
faster storage load now some of this is
dependent<00:01:04.019> upon<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.320> internet<00:01:04.680> connection

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

as<00:01:05.220> well<00:01:06.020> Annette<00:01:07.020> though<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.409> store<00:01:07.799> itself

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
as well Annette though this store itself

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.750 
as well Annette though this store itself
has<00:01:08.670> been<00:01:08.909> returned<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.860> beta<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
has been returned to out of beta so it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.370 
has been returned to out of beta so it
launches<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.330> bit<00:01:12.420> faster<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> people

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
launches a little bit faster and people

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.109 
launches a little bit faster and people
who<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.680> having<00:01:13.890> issues<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.340> downloading

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
who are having issues with downloading

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
who are having issues with downloading
apps<00:01:15.390> should<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> lot<00:01:16.590> better<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.009> now

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
apps should be a lot better right now

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
apps should be a lot better right now
especially<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.479> getting<00:01:18.689> stuck<00:01:19.110> on

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
especially if you're getting stuck on

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
especially if you're getting stuck on
things<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.710> should<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.009> fixed<00:01:20.430> though

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
things that should be fixed though

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
things that should be fixed though
something<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> store<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> perfect<00:01:22.110> i<00:01:22.170> think

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
something the store is perfect i think

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.330 
something the store is perfect i think
there<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.650> still<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.220> more

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there can still be some more

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
there can still be some more
optimizations<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.360> i'd<00:01:24.570> still<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.020> see

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
optimizations here i'd still like to see

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
optimizations here i'd still like to see

which is always kind of a weird thing so
we<00:01:36.060> should<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.360> able<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.869> more

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
came up today but with the previous

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.460 
came up today but with the previous
build<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> went<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> go<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> store<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> it

build when you went to go to store it it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
build when you went to go to store it it
would<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.799> crash<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
would actually crash but look at this

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
would actually crash but look at this
now<00:01:49.259> pulls<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.829> actual<00:01:50.340> apps<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.820> will<00:01:50.939> work

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
now pulls up actual apps that will work

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.730

with<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> new<00:01:51.630> wallet<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.439> pretty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
with the new wallet so that is pretty

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340 
with the new wallet so that is pretty
cool<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> those<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.479> integrate<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:55.110> with

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
cool so those will integrate now with

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.139 
cool so those will integrate now with
the<00:01:55.439> operating<00:01:55.920> system<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.579> we'll<00:01:57.000> give<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the operating system and we'll give that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.940 
the operating system and we'll give that
a<00:01:57.299> shot<00:01:57.420> later<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.200> how<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.439> works<00:01:58.740> as

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
a shot later and see how that works as

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
a shot later and see how that works as
well<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.430> i<00:01:59.729> will<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> link<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> new

little bit
well<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:13.020> actually<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.500> annoying

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
well it was actually kind of annoying

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.290 
well it was actually kind of annoying
but<00:02:14.400> now<00:02:14.490> everything<00:02:14.820> seems<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.180> working

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
but now everything seems to be working

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.570 
but now everything seems to be working
much<00:02:15.870> more<00:02:15.930> fluid<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.770> here<00:02:17.130> when<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.310> watched

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
much more fluid so here when I watched

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.310 
much more fluid so here when I watched
the<00:02:17.820> app<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.210> see<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> check<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.020> device

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
for new photos but you'll see how

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
for new photos but you'll see how
quickly<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.390> goes<00:02:21.600> over<00:02:22.110> all<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.350> browsers

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
different from previous builds but I'm

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.950 
different from previous builds but I'm

what's<00:02:36.900> more<00:02:37.350> consistent<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.610> do

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
what's more consistent now I really do

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
what's more consistent now I really do
appreciate<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.410> how<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> works<00:02:40.680> here's<00:02:41.100> twee

overall<00:02:44.460> really<00:02:45.180> good<00:02:45.330> build<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
overall really good build I think if you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.920 
overall really good build I think if you
are<00:02:47.070> waiting<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.760> jump<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.570> windows<00:02:48.900> 10

mobile<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:50.100> bill<00:02:50.340> will<00:02:50.730> probably<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
mobile this bill will probably be the

mobile this bill will probably be the
one<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:54.000> does

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
one you want to get on to this does

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.930 
one you want to get on to this does
match<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.930> desktop<00:02:55.530> which<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.490> also<00:02:56.700> at

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
match now the desktop which is also at

match now the desktop which is also at
10<00:02:57.150> 166<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.590> kind<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> first<00:02:59.160> time

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
10 166 so that's kind of the first time

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.680 
10 166 so that's kind of the first time
this<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.580> actually<00:03:00.000> happened<00:03:00.360> with<00:03:00.450> both<00:03:00.660> of
