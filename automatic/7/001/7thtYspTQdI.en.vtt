00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
great the tank is the D and that's

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.950 
great the tank is the D and that's
because<00:00:11.070> I've<00:00:11.730> got<00:00:11.910> my<00:00:12.030> new<00:00:12.179> aquarium<00:00:12.540> lights

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
just six mil MDF I'll then cut it all

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.910 
just six mil MDF I'll then cut it all
out<00:00:23.420> me<00:00:24.420> trout<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.900> square<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> everything

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480 
out me trout was square and everything
that's<00:00:26.070> gotta<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.369> perfect<00:00:28.369> put<00:00:29.369> together

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that's gotta be perfect put together

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.870 
that's gotta be perfect put together
with<00:00:29.820> PVA<00:00:30.269> glue<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:31.920> painted<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.579> black

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with PVA glue and then painted it black

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
with PVA glue and then painted it black
like<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> glossy<00:00:33.960> block<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:35.250> sanded<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> down

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
if you look at it from this angle it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.229 
if you look at it from this angle it
matches<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.540> like<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.969> yeah<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> looks

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
matches in like that so yeah it looks

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.920 
matches in like that so yeah it looks
quite<00:00:45.480> nice<00:00:47.120> I've<00:00:48.120> had<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> trouble

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
quite nice I've had a bit of trouble

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.880 
quite nice I've had a bit of trouble
actually<00:00:49.230> fixing<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.370> bulb<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.829> how<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually fixing the bulb in and how to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.150 
actually fixing the bulb in and how to
end<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.600> having<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:54.690> two<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.289> coming

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
end up having these two things coming

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
end up having these two things coming
over<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> top<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> they're<00:00:58.770> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
over at the top of it and they're just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
over at the top of it and they're just
the<00:00:59.160> ends<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> screws<00:01:00.289> because<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the ends of the screws because I

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
the ends of the screws because I
couldn't<00:01:01.620> find<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:01.920> screws<00:01:02.340> small<00:01:02.789> enough<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
couldn't find any screws small enough to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.550 
couldn't find any screws small enough to
go<00:01:03.390> through<00:01:03.600> six<00:01:03.840> millimeter<00:01:05.030> MDF<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.560> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
go through six millimeter MDF so it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
go through six millimeter MDF so it
doesn't<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:07.890> too<00:01:07.950> bad<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.369> suppose<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.970> too

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
doesn't look too bad I suppose not too

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
doesn't look too bad I suppose not too
noticeable<00:01:09.680> got<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> filter<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.250> there<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
noticeable got the filter back there so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
noticeable got the filter back there so
this<00:01:12.630> strip<00:01:12.960> sits<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> middle<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this strip sits in the middle of the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.770 
this strip sits in the middle of the
tank<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> looks<00:01:15.270> too<00:01:15.540> bad

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
tank I don't think it looks too bad

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.249 
tank I don't think it looks too bad
actually<00:01:16.619> while<00:01:17.040> sit<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.700> my<00:01:17.820> bed<00:01:18.259> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
actually while sit down on my bed it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
actually while sit down on my bed it
looks<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.320> crazy<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
looks really good but it's crazy it just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.020 
looks really good but it's crazy it just
brings<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> callosum<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> fish<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
brings the the callosum the fish it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
brings the the callosum the fish it's
just<00:01:27.240> absolutely<00:01:27.810> amazing<00:01:29.630> just<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.840> how

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just absolutely amazing just how how

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.130 
just absolutely amazing just how how
bright<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.460> mean<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.600> compare<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
bright it is I mean if I compare it to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.260 
bright it is I mean if I compare it to
my<00:01:34.259> LEDs<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:35.250> were<00:01:35.400> nothing<00:01:35.820> compared<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
my LEDs they were nothing compared to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
my LEDs they were nothing compared to
this<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:37.409> brings<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.829> read<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> Ludwig

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this it brings a read out in the Ludwig

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.280 
this it brings a read out in the Ludwig
yeah<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> lot<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.340> red<00:01:41.549> from

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
yeah and it looks a lot more red from

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.550 
yeah and it looks a lot more red from
human<00:01:43.290> eyes<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:45.000> red<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:46.170> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
human eyes but it's pretty red it's like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.230 
human eyes but it's pretty red it's like
picking<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> highlights<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.909> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
picking out all the highlights and in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.170 
picking out all the highlights and in
the<00:01:48.360> Ludwig<00:01:48.570> ear<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> hopefully<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> puns

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the Ludwig ear so hopefully the puns

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.560 
the Ludwig ear so hopefully the puns
should<00:01:51.390> benefit<00:01:52.049> from<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.880> higher<00:01:53.880> light<00:01:54.240> oh

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
should benefit from this higher light oh

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260 
should benefit from this higher light oh
it's<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.950> t-virus<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.909> still<00:01:57.090> pretty

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's not t-virus but it's still pretty

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.249 
it's not t-virus but it's still pretty
bright<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:59.329> so<00:02:00.329> yeah<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.630> improves

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
bright and so yeah it just improves

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
bright and so yeah it just improves
everything<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.009> looks<00:02:02.100> great<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
everything that looks great so this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.910 
everything that looks great so this
project<00:02:03.899> steno<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.619> was<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> success<00:02:05.399> overall

could<00:02:21.260> Pina<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.860> matte<00:02:22.129> white<00:02:22.329> because<00:02:23.329> I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
could Pina like a matte white because I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.960 
could Pina like a matte white because I
painted<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.079> shiny<00:02:24.349> wait<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.579> not<00:02:25.790> really

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
painted it is shiny wait I'm not really

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.720 
painted it is shiny wait I'm not really
bothered<00:02:26.239> about<00:02:26.959> getting<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.920> hundred<00:02:28.610> percent

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
bothered about getting a hundred percent

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.420 
bothered about getting a hundred percent
efficiency<00:02:29.390> out<00:02:29.659> of<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> light<00:02:30.110> more<00:02:31.040> I'm

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
efficiency out of the light more I'm

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.009 
efficiency out of the light more I'm
only<00:02:31.700> really<00:02:31.970> bothered<00:02:32.420> about<00:02:32.510> getting

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
only really bothered about getting

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.289 
only really bothered about getting
eighty<00:02:33.650> ninety<00:02:34.190> percent<00:02:34.370> efficiency<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
eighty ninety percent efficiency out of

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.080 
eighty ninety percent efficiency out of
it<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.670> bright<00:02:37.879> enough

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
it because really this is bright enough

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.699 
it because really this is bright enough
for<00:02:38.150> me<00:02:38.420> even<00:02:38.659> like<00:02:39.579> ten<00:02:40.579> percent<00:02:41.409> less<00:02:42.409> bright

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
for me even like ten percent less bright

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.309 
for me even like ten percent less bright
in<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.040> would<00:02:43.400> make<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.879> quite<00:02:44.090> happy<00:02:44.390> but

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
in this would make is quite happy but

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.660 
in this would make is quite happy but
it's<00:02:45.409> just<00:02:45.560> amazed<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> colors<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.920> in

it's just amazed and the colors so in

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.930 
it's just amazed and the colors so in
the<00:02:49.819> future<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.480> might<00:02:51.519> pee<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.639> they're<00:02:52.790> like

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the future I might pee and they're like

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.030 
the future I might pee and they're like
oh<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.329> matte<00:02:53.510> white<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.959> sayd<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.500> it's

fine<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.670> at<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> minute<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:58.220> got

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
fine as it is at a minute and I got

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.720 
fine as it is at a minute and I got
worried<00:02:59.000> about<00:02:59.560> how<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.980> would<00:03:01.099> get<00:03:01.340> put<00:03:01.579> to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
worried about how it would get put to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.930 
worried about how it would get put to
the<00:03:01.849> touch<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.959> only<00:03:03.109> warm<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.730> should

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
the touch this is only warm so it should

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.430 
the touch this is only warm so it should
be<00:03:04.970> alright<00:03:06.700> I'll<00:03:07.700> show<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.970> inside<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.629> design

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
be alright I'll show you inside I design

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.339 
be alright I'll show you inside I design
this<00:03:09.650> would<00:03:09.859> be<00:03:10.010> very<00:03:10.340> light<00:03:10.639> to<00:03:10.819> pick<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
this would be very light to pick up so I

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.610 
this would be very light to pick up so I
picked<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.799> very<00:03:13.069> thin<00:03:13.700> MDF<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.780> picked<00:03:15.170> six

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
picked the very thin MDF I picked six

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.659 
picked the very thin MDF I picked six
millimeter<00:03:16.180> white<00:03:17.180> MDF<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.919> that<00:03:19.310> means<00:03:19.489> it's

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
millimeter white MDF so that means it's

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.670 
millimeter white MDF so that means it's
very<00:03:19.910> light<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.750> only<00:03:20.900> things<00:03:21.169> inside

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
very light so the only things inside

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.409 
very light so the only things inside
here<00:03:21.949> is<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> cube<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:25.459> two<00:03:25.669> plugs<00:03:26.120> for

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
here is just the cube the two plugs for

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.170 
here is just the cube the two plugs for
the<00:03:26.510> tube<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.739> wires<00:03:28.069> on<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.609> box<00:03:28.910> so

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the tube and the wires on this box so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.759 
the tube and the wires on this box so
it's<00:03:29.329> very<00:03:29.510> light<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.989> mean<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.379> pick<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.620> up

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
it's very light I mean I can pick it up

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:40.290 
it's very light I mean I can pick it up
beforehand<00:03:34.510> there<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.660> is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:49.080

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
so yeah quite cool I mention in one of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.560 
so yeah quite cool I mention in one of
our<00:03:49.210> videos

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
our videos

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.670 
our videos
the<00:03:50.020> bulb<00:03:50.260> itself<00:03:51.720> actually<00:03:52.720> looks<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.290> pure

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
the bulb itself actually looks a pure

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.070 
the bulb itself actually looks a pure
blush<00:03:53.920> color<00:03:54.250> her<00:03:54.550> blush<00:03:54.790> blue<00:03:55.060> but<00:03:55.870> as<00:03:55.960> you

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
spectrum but it makes a tank look normal

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.250 
spectrum but it makes a tank look normal
so<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.090> really<00:04:10.360> nice<00:04:10.600> I'm<00:04:10.870> really<00:04:11.110> happy

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
so it's really nice I'm really happy

so it's really nice I'm really happy
with<00:04:11.440> how<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.620> stand<00:04:11.980> out<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.850> overall<00:04:13.480> I'd

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
with how to stand out and overall I'd

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.890 
with how to stand out and overall I'd
say<00:04:13.990> it<00:04:14.320> cost<00:04:14.590> me<00:04:14.860> about<00:04:18.090> 40<00:04:19.090> pounds<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:19.750> that's

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
say it cost me about 40 pounds so that's

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.870 
say it cost me about 40 pounds so that's
$60<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:21.970> isn't<00:04:22.240> too<00:04:22.390> bad<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.870> suppose<00:04:23.880> pretty
