of dynamic switch over and ebb and flow

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.910 
of dynamic switch over and ebb and flow
you<00:02:55.629> basically<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.200> grab<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.530> handle

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you basically going to grab the handle

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
lifts up and you roll it down this was a

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.089 
lifts up and you roll it down this was a
lot<00:03:07.659> of<00:03:07.780> work<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.169> lot<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.349> coordination<00:03:08.709> in

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.050 
a long time coming we were lucky enough
to<00:03:11.169> get<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.530> land<00:03:11.769> essentially<00:03:12.519> for<00:03:12.700> free<00:03:12.730> as

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
to get the land essentially for free as

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.429 
to get the land essentially for free as
part<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.329> an<00:03:13.450> agreement<00:03:13.540> with<00:03:13.900> Union<00:03:14.200> Station

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
part of an agreement with Union Station

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.159 
part of an agreement with Union Station
and<00:03:14.769> then<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.849> a<00:03:15.879> matter<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.269> planning<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
and then it was a matter of planning and

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.599 
and then it was a matter of planning and
designing<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.769> facility<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.430> pretty

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
designing the facility it's a pretty

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.520 
designing the facility it's a pretty
tight<00:03:18.909> space<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.720> see<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.109> we're

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
tight space as you can see here we're

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.740 
tight space as you can see here we're
right<00:03:20.680> between<00:03:21.010> two<00:03:21.400> large<00:03:22.120> historic

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
right between two large historic

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.599 
right between two large historic
buildings<00:03:23.139> one<00:03:23.290> being<00:03:23.470> Union<00:03:23.859> Station<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
buildings one being Union Station and

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.969 
buildings one being Union Station and
one<00:03:24.790> being<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> old<00:03:25.269> post<00:03:25.510> office<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.319> we<00:03:26.859> had

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
one being the old post office so we had

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.770 
one being the old post office so we had
a<00:03:27.010> great<00:03:27.280> architect<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.000> project<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:28.510> he

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
a great architect on the project and he

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.119 
a great architect on the project and he
came<00:03:28.930> up<00:03:29.049> with<00:03:29.139> this<00:03:29.260> shape<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.889> actual

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
came up with this shape the actual

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.830 
came up with this shape the actual
design<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.459> think<00:03:30.609> we<00:03:30.879> looked<00:03:31.209> at<00:03:31.299> bicycles

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
design I think we looked at bicycles

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.689 
design I think we looked at bicycles
bicycles<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.650> elegant<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.190> extremely

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
bicycles and elegant and extremely

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.550 
bicycles and elegant and extremely
efficient<00:03:34.120> structure<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.810> wanted<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.290> echo

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
efficient structure so we wanted to echo

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.229 
efficient structure so we wanted to echo
that<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:36.040> class<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.699> can<00:03:36.819> see<00:03:37.000> through<00:03:37.209> it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
that it's class you can see through it

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.520 
that it's class you can see through it
and<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:37.479> can<00:03:37.599> see<00:03:37.720> around<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.199> at<00:03:38.290> either<00:03:38.409> end

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and you can see around it at either end

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.619 
and you can see around it at either end
so<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.250> doesn't<00:03:39.489> detract<00:03:39.729> from<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.180> historic

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
so it doesn't detract from the historic

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.839 
so it doesn't detract from the historic
buildings<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.650> either<00:03:41.709> side<00:03:42.129> this<00:03:42.609> bike

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.539 
buildings on either side this bike
station<00:03:43.299> was<00:03:43.510> was<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> first<00:03:44.409> it<00:03:44.739> was<00:03:45.129> about<00:03:45.489> a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
station was was a first it was about a

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.649 
station was was a first it was about a
four<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:45.879> half<00:03:45.970> million<00:03:46.180> dollar<00:03:46.419> project

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
four and half million dollar project

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.619 
four and half million dollar project
because<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:47.799> had<00:03:47.889> to<00:03:48.010> match<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
because we had to match the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.659 
because we had to match the
architectural<00:03:49.680> beauty<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.769> Union<00:03:51.069> Station<00:03:51.310> we

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
architectural beauty of Union Station we

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.860 
architectural beauty of Union Station we
had<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.879> build<00:03:52.000> something<00:03:52.299> really<00:03:52.750> really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
had to build something really really

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.110 
had to build something really really
gorgeous<00:03:53.109> however<00:03:53.829> we<00:03:54.549> want<00:03:54.669> to<00:03:54.790> put<00:03:54.909> a<00:03:54.940> lot

gorgeous however we want to put a lot
more<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.419> these<00:03:55.540> around<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.900> city<00:03:56.139> and<00:03:56.319> we're

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
more of these around the city and we're

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.250 
more of these around the city and we're
looking<00:03:57.400> at<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> modular<00:03:58.269> version<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.139> that

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
looking at a modular version of it that

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.140 
looking at a modular version of it that
we<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.500> place<00:03:59.739> at<00:03:59.949> other<00:04:00.099> metro<00:04:00.639> stations

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
we can place at other metro stations

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.030 
we can place at other metro stations
what<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.870> expect<00:04:02.139> hopefully<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.859> that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
what you can expect hopefully is that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710 
what you can expect hopefully is that
there<00:04:03.190> are<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.430> be<00:04:03.489> hundreds<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.239> these

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
there are going to be hundreds of these

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.080 
there are going to be hundreds of these
facilities<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:06.250> you'll<00:04:06.459> be<00:04:06.609> able<00:04:06.699> to<00:04:06.879> park
