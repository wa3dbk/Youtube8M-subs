from Motorola scamp's that are getting
being<00:00:13.559> voiced<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:14.280> mid-range<00:00:14.519> devices<00:00:15.120> can

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
being voiced more mid-range devices can

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
being voiced more mid-range devices can
finally<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.010> respectable<00:00:17.010> high-end

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
finally have a respectable high-end

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.010 
finally have a respectable high-end
device<00:00:17.820> that's<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.330> coming<00:00:18.450> out<00:00:18.720> for

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
device that's going to be coming out for

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.460 
device that's going to be coming out for
them<00:00:19.230> specifically<00:00:20.190> it<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> more<00:00:21.330> inch<00:00:21.570> qhd

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
them specifically it has a more inch qhd

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
them specifically it has a more inch qhd
display<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.940> resolution<00:00:24.410> 540<00:00:25.410> x

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
display so that's as a resolution 540 x

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.060 
display so that's as a resolution 540 x
960<00:00:26.370> pixels<00:00:27.120> so<00:00:27.600> at<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.870> resolution<00:00:28.230> even

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
960 pixels so at that resolution even

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.280 
960 pixels so at that resolution even
the<00:00:29.160> smallest<00:00:29.640> tax<00:00:30.030> is<00:00:30.210> very<00:00:30.420> crisp<00:00:30.810> visitor

we like the overall size it's a little

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.320 
we like the overall size it's a little
bit<00:00:40.830> on<00:00:40.920> inner<00:00:41.190> side<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.490> very<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.210> very

all the metallic elements are finding
some<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.770> motorola's<00:00:52.770> other<00:00:53.220> devices<00:00:53.670> I'm

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
some of motorola's other devices I'm

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.030 
some of motorola's other devices I'm
glad<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.810> and<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> pattern<00:00:55.380> designed<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> back

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
glad this and a pattern designed to back

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.030 
glad this and a pattern designed to back
but<00:00:56.310> it's<00:00:56.700> mostly<00:00:57.000> plastic<00:00:57.660> ian<00:00:57.900> by<00:00:58.079> nature<00:00:58.770> so
