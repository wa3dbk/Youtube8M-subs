 [Music] 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.970
 kids that you are, you know that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 I have not been uploading videos for a week now and it's 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.410
 that if very loose for not the truth be 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.279
 more with the forehead feeding and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.929
 good catches me another and by what 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 would be in the video this along the 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.319
 video we will show how the other one is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.909
 is that it keep or is the cables 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.839
 burned and good since we 're that 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.839
 just the store 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.950
 the company robert 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 what is a lie and once only the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.280
 cobra 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 well I'm seeing that a source 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.739
 850 watt power to an afternoon in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 the cheapest I've seen by lobato 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 that you have since it is the one that has me 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.900
 is not worth a girl because I do not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.930
 I started pulling cattle but I 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.750
 missing good things I'm looking for here 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 where pussy opens up here I do not want 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 break the box just in case 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.490
 defective or something like that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 so good 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 the power cord here we have 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 one that comes 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.710
 that old good whore if you're watching 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 where do they come with the cables that I 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 I wanted good afternoon the source 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.810
 food you are here are for the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.910
 two pc hard drives and that the previous 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 I already had one so now it would be returned 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.780
 Carlos because Carlos gave me one of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.370
 are you these little ones because it made me 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.240
 missing to have the two graphs because 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.340
 I put two 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.520
 here we have other ways of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.780
 feeding with two more more of sac 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 what puts it here is that they are at 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.700
 reverse one and here the other 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 graphic that could be missing me there 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.530
 sorry this is from the plate I was wrong 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.250
 201 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.130
 3 of pci 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.570
 two 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.990
 with other graphics you come alone with 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.120
 one power cord every 192 only 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.210
 dan is perfect I have to put only one 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.550
 good part here we have the source 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.650
 feeding on the other wave we are going to 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.140
 teach was in the next video and has 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 was therefore burned whole or is I 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.740
 when the start 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.480
 did not spend even 20 seconds and left 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.480
 there by a white cloud 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.400
 implying that we have now 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.400
 stuck in nabai 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.960
 apart from how to dismantle the previous 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.720
 let's ride like 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 as we have with the child 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 well here we have the computer already 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.550
 you are seeing that at first glance it seems 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.200
 what is new and 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.580
 in the goats that more so then the other 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.410
 part now we will turn the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.740
 source feed 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.450
 and nothing is going to one that you are seeing 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.430
 the wires are burned look here 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.460
 are burned here is that I do not know 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 jump into the camera but they are burned 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.420
 whole this comes through here in and 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.010
 luck comes to the source as well 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 has melted whole or has left 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.910
 smoke everywhere seems incredible or 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.650
 is not it is cheating us is cheating and 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.630
 all these cables are inside 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
 made dust they have burned all of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.420
 done to get this out we've thrown it away 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.730
 half a life because they are melted 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.260
 connectors and I hope you have not loaded me 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.030
 well we have already changed what will be 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.270
 the power supply to the times of the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.040
 tower we are going to subtract because just 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.020
 the cable that was made shit was the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.150
 of the hard disk and to put the disk 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.690
 hard had melted so let's go 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.690
 to try it to see 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.700
 it looks like it's on 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.200
 to see if the image looks something because it does not 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.650
 you see nothing is by hm 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.380
 good 20 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.910
 let's fix the tower 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.820
 now it 's fine it's already working 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.840
 perfectly the tower gets that this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.840
 it would have to work too 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.540
 and nothing people 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.870
 but what we are going to need this is the 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.660
 ancient source the source that I had 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.040
 is practically burned does not have what 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.410
 only bus that has the fan 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.660
 I will use it for whatever, but 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.160
 we were made dust is burnt 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.150
 entire all cables are burned 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.150
 inside 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.670
 of retirement 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.260
 note that the corpse has it 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.790
 melted whole has it with bubbles and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.810
 all this part is melted has it 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.810
 made polo to see if I can 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.800
 even if you do not see it is not appreciated well in 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.050
 the picture is all the poles 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.120
 melted are made dust so 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.040
 which there is no fix that is the only 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.840
 way of fixing the molex and neither 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.340
 because whatever the account of 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.660
 meditation inside is also done 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.890
 dust and what good implementation because not 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.090
 is what I will do with it the strip of 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.270
 Oropesa because it is good 700 watts 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:40.710
 here 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:43.290
 comes from 700 neighborhood a brand that has 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.620
 of 700 watts at least to put 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.970
 graphics and such goes well so nothing 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.650
 good with this video because we already 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.980
 we said goodbye 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.550
 with the computer 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.950
 there you have it working perfectly 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.330
 with all the fans and everything is 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.710
 of course it does not go because it is not plugged in like this 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.750
 what good people I think you liked the 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.670
 today's video we could not teach 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.100
 how do we assemble the source since 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.130
 We are full of cables and it has been a 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.490
 awful mess and I'll keep things for 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.750
 there so good we said goodbye and we 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.420
 we see in another video and be able to do the 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.420
 gameplay come to see you later chao
