we're<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> reduce<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.559> heat<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we're going to reduce the heat and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
we're going to reduce the heat and
simmer<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.510> need<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.780> watch<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.290> closely
