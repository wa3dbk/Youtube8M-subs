00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.889
 Welcome to a new edition of her 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.599
 culinary serb today we want 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:09.980
 manuel the court does what me though 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.600
 not from the ingredients now 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.120
 but necessarily for the taste all the more 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.890
 has convinced more and that is heaven and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.840
 Earth is called and for that we need 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.939
 a bit of bacon and potatoes 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.249
 onions and to season salt and sugar 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.869
 vinegar actually relatively simple, the 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.489
 potato not no we small one 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.019
 small dice enter 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.159
 a little pot and leave that 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.599
 just cook 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.090
 important is that you do not have the potato 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.170
 absolutely cooked because there was something else 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 on top of it we can go 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.350
 It's going to make me slim in the beginning 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.989
 But you can also only at the end with the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.250
 vinegar the sugar and the salt and if 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.850
 the whole then simmered a bit 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.350
 so ten minutes or an hour to go 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.110
 Let's just get the quartered pieces of apple 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.820
 on top 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.360
 and let it take another ten minutes 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 simmer 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 and so it should look like when it boils 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.379
 until all rich enough 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 and then we just leave the bacon 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.399
 a hot pan sometimes 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.399
 bit out 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910
 and then add the onions too 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.820
 like that and when we finish cooking 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.000
 we just go the bacon and 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.540
 onions from the pan on top 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.970
 above 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.370
 There are also variants since you have that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.500
 So all the apples and the potatoes 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.960
 completely mashed the variant exists 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 also or one has instead of the apples too 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.260
 Pears used to serve on the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.770
 best fried bloodwurst or 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.510
