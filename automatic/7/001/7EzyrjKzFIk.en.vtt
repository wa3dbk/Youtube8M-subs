it now my next project is going to be
the<00:06:54.370> flues<00:06:54.580> Camaro<00:06:55.030> but<00:06:55.300> I<00:06:55.360> got<00:06:55.600> a<00:06:55.630> whole

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
the flues Camaro but I got a whole

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.540 
the flues Camaro but I got a whole
different<00:06:56.620> ballgame<00:06:56.890> with<00:06:57.340> that<00:06:57.520> and<00:06:59.550> again

I'll<00:07:00.760> start<00:07:00.940> keeping<00:07:01.720> these<00:07:01.840> guys<00:07:02.110> up<00:07:02.350> to<00:07:02.470> date

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
I'll start keeping these guys up to date

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.520 
I'll start keeping these guys up to date
on<00:07:02.680> it's<00:07:03.010> probably<00:07:03.460> going<00:07:03.610> to<00:07:03.700> be<00:07:04.530> slower

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
on it's probably going to be slower

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.680 
on it's probably going to be slower
dates<00:07:05.920> and<00:07:06.340> much<00:07:06.580> later<00:07:06.910> dates<00:07:07.210> coming<00:07:07.660> up

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
dates and much later dates coming up

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.870 
dates and much later dates coming up
dates<00:07:08.410> on<00:07:08.650> it<00:07:08.680> only<00:07:09.070> because<00:07:09.370> I'm<00:07:09.580> going<00:07:09.790> back

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
dates on it only because I'm going back

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.580 
dates on it only because I'm going back
to<00:07:10.120> work<00:07:10.270> on<00:07:10.570> the<00:07:10.750> 30th<00:07:11.170> and<00:07:12.990> back<00:07:13.990> to<00:07:14.140> six<00:07:14.380> days

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
to work on the 30th and back to six days

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.800 
to work on the 30th and back to six days
a<00:07:14.620> week

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.950 

so<00:07:18.750> it<00:07:19.750> just<00:07:20.050> going<00:07:20.230> to<00:07:20.320> be<00:07:20.380> slower<00:07:20.680> building

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
so it just going to be slower building

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.210 
so it just going to be slower building
plus<00:07:22.960> especially<00:07:23.560> since<00:07:23.770> it's<00:07:23.950> summer<00:07:24.130> time

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220 
plus especially since it's summer time

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.210 
plus especially since it's summer time
