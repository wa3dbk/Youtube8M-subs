when he grabbed me they wouldn't just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
when he grabbed me they wouldn't just
that<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> think<00:01:08.790> they're<00:01:08.909> coming<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> stab<00:01:09.510> me

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
that I think they're coming to stab me
again<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> they<00:01:10.650> stabbed<00:01:10.920> him<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> arm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
again and they stabbed him in the arm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
again and they stabbed him in the arm
and<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> shoulder<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.510> he<00:01:12.689> deflected<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and in the shoulder and he deflected it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
and in the shoulder and he deflected it
