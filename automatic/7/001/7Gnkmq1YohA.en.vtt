00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the spawn point right here so let's see

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.370 
the spawn point right here so let's see
well<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> love<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.570> i<00:00:28.170> thought

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
was cool is you can't place lava in the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
was cool is you can't place lava in the
spiny<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.679> little

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

thing<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.750> found<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> do

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
thing so the way i actually found a do

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
thing so the way i actually found a do
it<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> put<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.739> inside<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> dispenser

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it was you put it inside of a dispenser

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.690 
it was you put it inside of a dispenser
and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.440> simply<00:00:37.860> dispense<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and then you just simply dispense it out

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.340 
and then you just simply dispense it out
and<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> goes<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> spawn<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and it goes you know in the spawn so I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.389 
and it goes you know in the spawn so I
don't<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.649> know<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.219> use

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
don't know we know what you would use

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
don't know we know what you would use
this<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.200> but<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> mean<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> thought<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this for but I mean I thought it was

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
this for but I mean I thought it was
nice<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> know<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.670> builders

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
nice to know I don't know if builders

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.190 
nice to know I don't know if builders
want<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
want to do it or not but I mean then you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
want to do it or not but I mean then you
can<00:00:46.350> remove<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.739> obviously<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> lava<00:00:47.670> just

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can remove it obviously in the lava just

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
can remove it obviously in the lava just
will<00:00:48.300> stay<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> creative<00:00:49.829> mode

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
will stay there I'm in creative mode

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.110 
will stay there I'm in creative mode
because<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> stuff<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
because you know some of the stuff is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
because you know some of the stuff is
easier<00:00:52.079> during<00:00:52.170> credit<00:00:52.500> mode<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.100> yeah<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
easier during credit mode but yeah so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
easier during credit mode but yeah so
this<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.690> survival<00:00:55.050> mode<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this can be done in survival mode and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
this can be done in survival mode and
you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> ok<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.149> now

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

here<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.470> bottom<00:01:22.580> then<00:01:23.580> where<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.119> can

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
here on the bottom then where they can

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.550 
here on the bottom then where they can
jump<00:01:24.509> onto<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.049> they'll<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.320> get

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
jump onto it and they'll actually get

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
jump onto it and they'll actually get
down<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.070> long<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.610> long<00:01:26.790> as

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
down but as long as I think as long as

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
down but as long as I think as long as
it<00:01:27.119> basically<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.229> fall

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it basically what it is if they fall

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.630 
it basically what it is if they fall
down<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.189> taken<00:01:29.369> damage

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
down and they would have taken damage

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.660 
down and they would have taken damage
then<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.570> simply<00:01:30.869> don't<00:01:31.110> jump<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
then they simply don't jump down so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.359 
then they simply don't jump down so
let's<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:34.409> chicken<00:01:34.619> chickens

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
let's see we can put my chicken chickens

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
let's see we can put my chicken chickens
will<00:01:35.549> stay<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:35.970> cows<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:36.990> stay<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.229> here

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
will stay up here cows will stay up here

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
will stay up here cows will stay up here
you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.799> breathe<00:01:38.250> them<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you can actually breathe them from like

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.289 
you can actually breathe them from like
like<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.380> stick<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> stick<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.909> then

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
like you know stick to stick and then

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
like you know stick to stick and then
the<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> baby

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the one of them will just have a baby

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.170 
the one of them will just have a baby
underneath<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.970> keep

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
underneath them so you could just keep

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
underneath them so you could just keep
stacking<00:01:45.810> cows<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.829> breeding<00:01:47.100> them

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
stacking cows up here and breeding them

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
stacking cows up here and breeding them
and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.119> once<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> were<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.780> done<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.259> can

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and then once you were all done you can

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.690 
and then once you were all done you can
actually<00:01:49.500> slaughter<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.549> they're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
actually slaughter them all when they're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
actually slaughter them all when they're
up<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> stick<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> wanted<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> do
