00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:07.909
 This plant is built for MABE refrigerators, from QuerÃ©taro, Qro. 

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:18.718
 for the total of all its waste, sanitary and process water. 

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:35.392
 This plant is for 200 to 250 cubic meters per day 

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:56.366
 by means of these pumps the waste water is fed 

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.009
 to the treatment plant 

00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:08.985
 the water is collected in a cistern, which is low level 

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:14.157
 this is the water that is being fed to the plant 

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:18.458
 sanitary waters and process waters, 

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:24.356
 this is another car park where process water is received 

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:30.185
 this water is reloaded from here to the previous station 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.210
 to be treated together with sanitary water. 

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:43.668
 This water contains a large number of phosphates, 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:50.864
 a large amount of solids in suspension, and 

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:52.748
 a lot of fat and oil. 

00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.949
 This is our air supply to the plant 

00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:05.695
 by means of blowers of 20HPs each 

00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:16.569
 in these plants a waiting blower is left 

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:18.793
 and two in operation 

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:24.755
 Reactors already working with biomass, air and 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.451
 the residual water to be treated, 

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:32.282
 This plant consists of 5 reactors, 

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.170
 which have the same aeration system 

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:40.427
 and the water is going by gravity from one to another 

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.842
 until you get to the last one and from here 

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:49.200
 go to our clarifier or clarification system 

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:51.699
 of the water already treated. 

00:02:57.207 --> 00:03:01.031
 This is the water that is being cut from the clarification system 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.578
 to our treated water pit, 

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:07.001
 As you can see, this water is already completely 

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:11.025
 well treated and crystalline, 

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:16.910
 On some occasions, this water comes out a small 

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:21.461
 yellowing or straw, but with a color 

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:24.306
 of 30 units or less. 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.928
 This water to be chlorinated to kill microorganisms 

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.632
 it is completely crystalline and white, 

00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:36.504
 as you can see in this jar, 

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:42.000
 This water passes the norms NOM-001, 002 and 003 

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:46.973
 and if it is passed through a bed of activated carbon 

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:50.267
 passes the NOM-127 and NOM-041 

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:57.901
 This water is the one that is cut directly from the plant 

00:03:58.403 --> 00:04:01.081
 and this is passed through activated carbon. 

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:07.601
 Water treated in plant and passed through the bed 

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.659
 of activated carbon, is received in this cistern 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.560
 and from here, pumped to the elevated tank for 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.544
 its re-use. 

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:22.204
 The treated water is pumped from the elevated tank 

00:04:22.676 --> 00:04:26.612
 of the plant passed through a bed of activated carbon. 

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:33.019
 From this tank the water is supplied and used in 

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:38.423
 its total for toilets, for irrigation of green areas 

00:04:38.288 --> 00:04:40.767
 and for plant process
