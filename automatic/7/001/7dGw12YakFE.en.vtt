00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 we started that 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.250
 he started very well one 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.230
 have expired and 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.359
 pinokÃ© and that is typical 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 if I respect 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.499
 for set up you combine with the three front cars and and a good goal 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.960
 because those from the assistance are included in the competition 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.900
 don't have an eel terry after that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.119
 a few more good promotions returns through me I myself we must thing at least two 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:24.919
 score once 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.039
 yes and then yes then you go into peace with the big lead 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.160
 but 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.370
 that many think you are right the two parts today we do not care 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.870
 say 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.100
 That is very positive to come out 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.370
 but on the other hand where we are sloppy and also not good enough and in 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.630
 possession of the ball how about the album with that system to do about it 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.550
 play that purely in this system for the first time 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 well not fast again what so trained 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.659
 better again 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.149
 well i found him especially the gates of the latter 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.530
 the last training sessions 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.350
 it went very well 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.740
 but they are stepping into a home in the making only one today 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.500
 years we were in the time when a sloppy and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.470
 yes you should they should not also a bit actually a bit more guts a bit 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 more dare to play football from backwards 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.510
 and what faster the free people are looking for and 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.870
 no matter how well she said you shouldn't give up on it either went to win much according to 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.370
 a long ball was created 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.930
 but good and then you say there 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 or you should not attach too much value to this type of competition is therefore one 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190
 working harder at nec 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 in a world where different than usual if you do 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 or was it just not good in addition, I do not agree with you because you give 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 no chance really plays away from the zero 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.140
 and there we actually go there where you have a certain victory 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.899
 to invite 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.289
 you see that you are going i have created enough that i say i need a lot myself 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.510
 harder than you have 2 but further is after the 3 0 win 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.800
 so well i don't totally agree with that alone 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.100
 What I do agree with is that we are in possession of the ball that we are sometimes there 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.320
 what there we have to play better and today there was too much trouble with one 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 wrong 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 surround people with you the murdered almost no one yes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
 on the back who wrote about the write yes right I thought 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.100
 yes that was a transaction 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.749
 these two weeks before the wk and 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:13.249
 yes everything nice and nice weather can play the skin but it was just a one 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.229
 dark red card and 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.429
 but well he actually what 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.389
 we are already a year from basts i think always send tsss sense 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.559
 always have to look at what's in your back and i jumped up all up 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.249
 would arrive that really is a battle issue and 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.749
 that is not jump then 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.849
 twa knees thinks I told you at the time yes but I had to descend again 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.500
 the blows to the ground 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.950
 but the familial beerse that is again in the sport 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.259
 only my yes no just think but you think he will come to two weeks dkr 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.590
 what we do what we want 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.419
 who would have thought we were talking about four years ago I didn't make it 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.389
 in addition, one year after the 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.639
 years he worked with his actions I can just wk cost and 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.209
 I think because an open competition is about becoming a tax 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.329
 for example a lot of time researched but found it improved a lot 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.079
 yes well yes I think there are more positive points to take over 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.709
 just having bolsward would say then 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039
 I do not agree with me 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.469
 on top of that he gets
