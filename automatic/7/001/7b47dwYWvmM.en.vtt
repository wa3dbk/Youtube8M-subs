00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
snow ways the ice down the ice is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.140 
snow ways the ice down the ice is
actually<00:02:24.950> floating<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.930> top<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.560> water

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
actually floating on top of the water

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.750 
actually floating on top of the water
you<00:02:29.150> get<00:02:29.300> pressure<00:02:29.630> cracks<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.610> this

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you get pressure cracks and see this

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.840 
you get pressure cracks and see this
crack<00:02:32.620> extends<00:02:33.620> way<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.400> hell<00:02:34.520> over<00:02:34.550> there

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
crack extends way the hell over there

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.199 
crack extends way the hell over there
and<00:02:35.920> come<00:02:36.920> there<00:02:37.250> someone<00:02:37.610> driving<00:02:37.820> by<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and come there someone driving by on the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.380 
and come there someone driving by on the
truck<00:02:39.310> send<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> way<00:02:40.489> over<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.880> way<00:02:41.030> too<00:02:41.980> so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
truck send the way over that way too so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.570 
truck send the way over that way too so
when<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> get<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.660> pressure<00:02:44.900> crack<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.500> that

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
when you get a pressure crack like that

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.070 
when you get a pressure crack like that
the<00:02:46.580> water<00:02:46.970> will<00:02:47.150> come<00:02:47.330> up<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.630> between<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the water will come up in between the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.620 
the water will come up in between the
crack<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.530> top<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.920> ice<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.209> you've<00:02:50.360> gotten

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
crack on top of the ice so you've gotten

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.320 
crack on top of the ice so you've gotten
anywhere<00:02:51.260> between<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.790> couple<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.850> inches<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.300> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
foot of water on top of the ice if your

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.630 
foot of water on top of the ice if your
huts<00:02:55.970> sitting<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.660> ice<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.340> freezes

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
huts sitting on the ice and it freezes

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.699 
huts sitting on the ice and it freezes
in<00:02:59.000> there<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.630> fun<00:02:59.900> getting<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.320> out<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:02.709> using

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
in there have fun getting it out I using

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.550 
in there have fun getting it out I using
my<00:03:03.830> old<00:03:03.950> holes<00:03:04.660> add<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.690> bunch<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.140> people<00:03:06.200> out

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
my old holes add a bunch of people out

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.800 
my old holes add a bunch of people out
last<00:03:09.560> week<00:03:09.800> more<00:03:10.580> efficient<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.480> anyways
