00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 someday should be sorry how will 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.410
 I 'll get rid of tattoos that's lenny 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.099
 abbas two years ago she got involved 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.509
 tattoo tattoo on the arm 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.170
 her friend did not have it then 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:31.710
 Roger that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:33.660
 Today I am unhappy too 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.149
 I thought and I have now 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 recognizable is when the people are constantly 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.989
 to address it somehow found itself 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 I do not want to love at all 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 leave 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.480
 she wants to get rid of it and that's only possible 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.070
 the dermatologist doctor year eagle is the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.629
 black color pigments layer for 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.960
 remove the layer from the skin again 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.449
 with a special ruby laser and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 Lenja was lucky she had that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.289
 tattoo can develop an allergy 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.379
 because nobody controls what in the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.549
 tattoo colors really is 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.549
 safety glasses on and then it starts 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.070
 for the laity it looks like it would 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.540
 dissolve very much color immediately 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.580
 in fact, only the top one bursts 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.780
 skin layer from the laser light destroyed 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.650
 initially only the superficial 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 color pigments 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.399
 just the dark tattoos can be 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.310
 good readers and those after the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.630
 had acted laser are 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.080
 Parted pigment particles in the tissue 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.149
 around 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.610
 some of it will be explosive 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.860
 also discharged to the outside and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.259
 Of course tissue cells also come 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.280
 and digest some of these 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.750
 particles and close them though 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.689
 partly also again 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.429
 three days later the top 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.530
 color pigments have dissolved 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.750
 the lower layers of color now appear 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.390
 the surface is why 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.310
 lettering to see well again 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.940
 in four weeks then this lower must 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.590
 color layer can be attacked 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.989
 colored tattoos, on the other hand, hold mountains 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.549
 considerably more problems with the laser 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.130
 form unpredictable 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.410
 color changes turquoise and green can 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.390
 max brown rot can be very often 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.769
 not remove and also the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.319
 Ingredients of colorful colors 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.819
 are not subject to inspection at 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.410
 it can sting allergic 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.180
 you give reactions completely 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.580
 Often not like the colors put together 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.650
 Which chemicals have been used 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.450
 and at a distance at the same time 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.459
 Laser treatment will be the pigments 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.410
 changed and can at this moment 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.329
 acting toxic can cause allergies 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.650
 and you even try it 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.030
 proved that they partly too 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 can be carcinogenic 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.079
 every four weeks, countries must become one 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.230
 another laser session a total of ten 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.000
 times a tedious procedure after four 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.819
 months, the lettering will finally be 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.650
 pale brightening r &amp; d and also the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.450
 Points are not so and overall 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.140
 Of course, this full black is already 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.440
 a little bit lightened for every session 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.510
 has to pay 190 euros longer so much 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.720
 like the stinging of the tattoo altogether 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.280
 Should have cost in five months 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.859
 nothing more to be seen 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.160
 then spring is back and lenja can 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:26.720
 looking for a job in a short-sleeved shirt 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.720
 without the unloved active 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.819
 today is the first twelfth today 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.020
 world aids day today as well as everyone else 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.020
 other day of the year
