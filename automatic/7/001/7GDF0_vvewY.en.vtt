00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 Hello dear friends with us today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:11.969
 the next issue is again the gun and 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.639
 comparison and selection of the best and best 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.170
 would just talk to us about p2000 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.490
 success let's talk about now 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:29.160
 example p250 than p250 and for example 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 different from the five-seven we have by the way in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.469
 In this case, everything is not bad, we can immediately 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.530
 same on the chart provided by the company 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:44.090
 volvo volvo see what changes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.090
 and here changes the following things demage and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.480
 armor penetration what is armor 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 penetration armor penetration 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.110
 this is armor piercing that is armor piercing 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 at gun five-seven above 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 accordingly this gun is better 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 fit against players with the first and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 second armor on the other side 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 slightly 91 this indicator ufa it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.100
 77 indicator for p250 as well as d major 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.799
 It turns out Dimash caused by a gun 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 p250 a little higher than the pistols 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.220
 files on the other hand it is absolutely not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 so critical on the other hand again 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 35 demage 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.619
 250 each means literally three 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
 patron and so I understand in the near 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.140
 distances need to be put from the gun on 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 250 if this is hp from this 35 demage then 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 a man without armor for example I do not know 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.350
 exactly with these not familiar you again 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.110
 You can check with a friend yourself but three 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.899
 patron spa 250 minus because 35 35 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 35 is 105 respectively 105 x n at us 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.250
 there is no one only in pubs 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.009
 any or modems well here 32 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.500
 32 32 is 96 respectively special 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.049
 five-seven you leave 4 hp somehow 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.799
 all other indicators are enough 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.500
 identical even firerate it turns out 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.000
 firerate is speed, so basically 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 what is five-seven 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.739
 that by 250 is a good gun 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.569
 i prefer fight sam but again 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.560
 after this release I will probably take 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.510
 more often on 205 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.239
 from and because its price is 200 less 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 dollars and a gun and the same but at 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.840
 this one has more cartridges inserted here 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:31.290
 we are 20 by 100 and we have 250 after 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.989
 new patch is now 13 26 but on the other 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.840
 hand this is absolutely enough of course 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.269
 same for any round that is nobody 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.700
 just with a Five Seven you can walk and so 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.610
 nastraivat there there did not get 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.680
 recharged went on 250 question 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.530
 they don't need to waste their ammo need 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.510
 just try to shoot clearly and accurately in 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.019
 purpose and accordingly if you will 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 stick to this criterion 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.340
 accordingly you absolutely never 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.150
 You will need to take a gun for 250 but with 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.190
 other side for example on guns you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 everyone knows you are an amateur 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.750
 go for example to zik if they take 2 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.510
 1000 to the bottom stuck shoot for a minute 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.870
 I always go zik come here 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.190
 listen to change haeshka yo falcon worth 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.859
 500 dollars respectively can 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.900
 buy a grenade listen to yours rush if 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.040
 earlier on already throw a grenade 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.870
 stand at that angle and just 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.150
 kill all the comrades who fall 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.579
 through this window they will believe but 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.739
 if a clear kaeshka is a minus 40 kp there 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.630
 thirty forty two patrons goodbye 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.109
 two patrons goodbye well and make two 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.730
 three kilos 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.390
 your teammates connect and 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.970
 respectively, the round is taken from p250 and can 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.350
 do exactly the same but with this if you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.109
 miss you run out 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.609
 cartridges need to be recharged while the 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:51.180
 seven winters on seven rounds mainly 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.519
 legs more so you are from this position 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.200
 Mansa I can put behind the column 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.329
 longer give Manju respectively kill 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.139
 more players attack the other side 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.889
 flash drive 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.459
 Well, you don't always need us to gun 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.410
 always on the one hand a useful thing 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.900
 not always you can realize therefore 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.329
 if you have a clear combination with 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.489
 Well, of course, take 250 for their nut 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.470
 flash drive and also go here write your 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.299
 headshots are killing the body and 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 for example, there is a miracle throw back the grenade 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.050
 Japan work but again a lot of mine 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.900
 viewers this 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.520
 players are not of the highest level therefore 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.470
 you just donâ€™t have your flash grenade 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.900
 use for you i would recommend 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.970
 of course use a gun 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.050
 five-seven well here is a comparison 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.550
 friends hope you have this comparison 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.520
 I liked it in the next issue 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.370
 we will compare so 9 five-seven p250 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.259
 oh, but such guns for terrorists 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.259
 fingers up bye bye
