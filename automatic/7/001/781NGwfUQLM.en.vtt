I<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.450> important<00:03:02.110> about<00:03:02.350> taking

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
I think that is important about taking

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.110 
I think that is important about taking
the<00:03:03.760> accessories<00:03:04.330> out<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.600> their<00:03:04.720> boxes<00:03:06.120> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the accessories out of their boxes is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.710 
the accessories out of their boxes is
that<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:09.190> figures<00:03:09.550> are<00:03:09.760> made<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.180> PVC

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
that the figures are made of PVC

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.400 
that the figures are made of PVC
material<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.209> material<00:03:13.480> actually

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
material and this material actually

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.810 
material and this material actually
builds<00:03:14.920> up<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.400> gas<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:16.120> non-toxic<00:03:16.560> toxic<00:03:17.820> but

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
builds up a gas it's non-toxic toxic but

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.660 
builds up a gas it's non-toxic toxic but
if<00:03:19.180> they're<00:03:19.480> left<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.739> box<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.580> long

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
if they're left in the box for a long

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.770 
if they're left in the box for a long
time<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:22.989> don't<00:03:23.950> look<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
time if you don't look like you you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.560 
time if you don't look like you you
residue<00:03:26.350> or<00:03:26.769> they<00:03:27.100> can<00:03:27.280> develop<00:03:27.640> black

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
residue or they can develop black

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.740 
residue or they can develop black
blotches<00:03:29.350> because<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.310> gas<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.540> it's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
blotches because of the gas so it's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.710 
blotches because of the gas so it's
really<00:03:32.050> important<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.650> air<00:03:32.920> them<00:03:33.160> out<00:03:33.720> I'm

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
really important to air them out I'm

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
what it is all you have to do is run the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.980 
what it is all you have to do is run the
eraser<00:04:50.500> under<00:04:51.250> water<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.030> rub<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
eraser under water and rub it on the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.240 
eraser under water and rub it on the
figure<00:04:53.170> and<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.590> will<00:04:53.740> get<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.040> black

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
figure and it will get the black

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.120 
figure and it will get the black
blotches<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.420> be<00:04:55.720> careful<00:04:56.170> don't<00:04:56.800> use

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
blotches off just be careful don't use

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.750 
blotches off just be careful don't use
it<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:58.060> dark<00:04:58.990> colored<00:04:59.500> part<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.430> can<00:05:00.610> take

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
it on a dark colored part so it can take

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.900 
it on a dark colored part so it can take
the<00:05:01.000> paint<00:05:01.300> off<00:05:01.510> which<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.960> have<00:05:02.320> learned<00:05:02.910> but

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
the paint off which I have learned but

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.680 
the paint off which I have learned but
anyway<00:05:04.330> if<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:05.020> use<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.680> skin<00:05:06.690> it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
anyway if you use it on the skin it

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.310 
anyway if you use it on the skin it
takes<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.110> off<00:05:08.200> real<00:05:08.560> easily<00:05:09.780> now<00:05:10.780> I'm<00:05:11.050> going

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
takes it off real easily now I'm going

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.290 
takes it off real easily now I'm going
to<00:05:11.410> talk<00:05:11.560> about<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.860> little<00:05:12.160> bit<00:05:12.340> about<00:05:12.700> just

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
to talk about a little bit about just

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.090 
to talk about a little bit about just
letting<00:05:13.570> your<00:05:13.810> fingers<00:05:14.230> so<00:05:14.530> obviously<00:05:14.950> you

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
letting your fingers so obviously you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.430 
letting your fingers so obviously you
can<00:05:15.190> display<00:05:15.610> them<00:05:15.820> in<00:05:16.150> any<00:05:16.570> way<00:05:16.690> you<00:05:16.810> want<00:05:17.110> but

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
can display them in any way you want but

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.670 
can display them in any way you want but
I<00:05:17.910> recommend<00:05:18.910> if<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.050> have<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.290> huge

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
I recommend if you have a huge

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.900 
I recommend if you have a huge
collection<00:05:21.090> um<00:05:22.290> getting<00:05:23.400> some<00:05:24.400> type<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.640> glass

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
collection um getting some type of glass

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.860 
collection um getting some type of glass
casing<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:26.140> actually<00:05:26.770> don't<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.370> one

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.510 

expensive<00:05:31.870> if<00:05:32.590> you<00:05:32.740> can't<00:05:32.950> afford<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.340> I<00:05:33.460> do

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
expensive if you can't afford it I do

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.670 
expensive if you can't afford it I do
recommend<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.270> I'm<00:05:34.810> hoping<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.380> get<00:05:35.500> one

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
recommend it I'm hoping to get one

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.740 
recommend it I'm hoping to get one
eventually<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:36.730> helps<00:05:37.000> keep<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.330> dust<00:05:37.540> out

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
eventually it helps keep the dust out

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.990 
eventually it helps keep the dust out
and<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.800> displays<00:05:39.550> them<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.270> lot<00:05:40.810> better

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
and it just displays them a lot better

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.270 
and it just displays them a lot better

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
can buy to display your figures but

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.440

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
currently I just have them which I got

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.790 
currently I just have them which I got
for<00:05:52.690> $50<00:05:53.460> which<00:05:54.460> works<00:05:54.670> fine<00:05:54.970> um<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:56.650> only

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
for $50 which works fine um the only

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.320 
for $50 which works fine um the only
thing<00:05:56.920> is<00:05:57.070> they<00:05:57.400> get<00:05:58.300> dusty<00:05:58.510> easily<00:05:59.160> and<00:06:00.330> what

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
thing is they get dusty easily and what

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.020 
thing is they get dusty easily and what
I<00:06:01.450> do<00:06:01.510> is<00:06:02.050> if<00:06:02.920> they're<00:06:03.280> stuffed<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.730> leave<00:06:03.880> it

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
I do is if they're stuffed I leave it

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.469 
I do is if they're stuffed I leave it
off<00:06:04.150> but<00:06:04.570> normally<00:06:04.990> I'll<00:06:05.140> just

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
off but normally I'll just

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.989 
off but normally I'll just
every<00:06:05.900> two<00:06:06.680> three<00:06:06.710> weeks<00:06:07.129> so<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.669> don't<00:06:07.879> have

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:07.999 
every two three weeks so you don't have

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.089 
every two three weeks so you don't have
to<00:06:08.210> dust<00:06:08.419> them<00:06:08.599> every<00:06:08.960> day<00:06:09.110> but<00:06:09.169> I<00:06:09.439> mean<00:06:09.710> that's

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
to dust them every day but I mean that's

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.779 
to dust them every day but I mean that's
something<00:06:10.279> like<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:10.849> works<00:06:11.779> just<00:06:12.319> fine<00:06:12.789> so

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
something like this works just fine so

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.029
