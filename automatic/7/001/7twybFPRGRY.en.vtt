00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
the resolution is 5 mega so you may

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.050 
the resolution is 5 mega so you may

a<00:04:36.150> plan<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.500> introduce<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:39.240> around

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
a plan to introduce it I think around

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.650 
a plan to introduce it I think around
late<00:04:40.680> October<00:04:41.190> beginning<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.390> November

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
late October beginning of the November

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.940 
late October beginning of the November
and<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.590> price<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:43.920> expected<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.820> be<00:04:44.970> $1.99<00:04:45.950> a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
and the price is expected to be $1.99 a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.400 
and the price is expected to be $1.99 a
year<00:04:47.250> or<00:04:47.430> retail<00:04:47.730> so<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.660> state<00:04:48.870> price<00:04:49.140> will

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
year or retail so the state price will

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.100 
year or retail so the state price will
be<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.680> bit<00:04:49.770> low
