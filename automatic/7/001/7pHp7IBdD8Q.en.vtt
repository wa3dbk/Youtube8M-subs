00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
actually good machine now I know a lot

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
actually good machine now I know a lot
of<00:00:46.170> people<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.710> bounty<00:00:47.100> hunter<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of people don't like bounty hunter it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.069 
of people don't like bounty hunter it's
gotten<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> bad<00:00:48.780> rap<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.469> years<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.360 
gotten a bad rap over the years but this
little<00:00:52.379> machine<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> actually

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
little machine right here is actually

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
little machine right here is actually
pretty<00:00:53.460> good<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:55.140> basic<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.680> mean

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's got your on/off switch sensitivity

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's got your on/off switch sensitivity
you<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> discrimination<00:00:59.250> knob<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.140> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you got a discrimination knob and you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.830 
you got a discrimination knob and you
got<00:01:01.620> tone<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.579> discriminate<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.570> metal

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
got tone and discriminate and all metal

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.039 
got tone and discriminate and all metal
but<00:01:05.030> yeah<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.180> pretty<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:06.990> a

were to be a compadre for example this

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.569 
were to be a compadre for example this
is<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.319> gonna<00:02:59.409> have<00:02:59.620> even<00:02:59.889> all<00:03:00.159> these<00:03:00.340> buttons

of one 9-volt battery

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.970 
of one 9-volt battery
it's<00:03:11.019> super<00:03:11.590> super<00:03:11.769> light<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.500> only<00:03:14.739> downfall

it's super super light the only downfall

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.740 
it's super super light the only downfall
from<00:03:15.430> what<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.579> understand<00:03:16.000> from<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.329> forums

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
from what I understand from the forums

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.399 
from what I understand from the forums
is<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:18.430> example<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.299> 101<00:03:20.019> here

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
is that for example now on this 101 here

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.710 
is that for example now on this 101 here
you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.489> change<00:03:21.819> out<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.180> coil<00:03:22.510> if

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
you can you can change out this coil if

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.039 
you can you can change out this coil if
you<00:03:22.840> wanted<00:03:23.199> to<00:03:23.379> on<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.489> Tesoro<00:03:25.150> compadre<00:03:25.870> you

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
you wanted to on the Tesoro compadre you

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.990 
you wanted to on the Tesoro compadre you
can't<00:03:26.379> do<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.129> comes<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.519> standard<00:03:27.909> I

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
can't do that it comes with a standard I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.969 
can't do that it comes with a standard I
think<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.359> 5<00:03:28.659> inch<00:03:28.959> coil<00:03:29.319> it's<00:03:29.859> like<00:03:29.949> a

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
think it's a 5 inch coil it's like a

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.309 
think it's a 5 inch coil it's like a
little<00:03:30.159> sniper<00:03:30.489> coil<00:03:31.030> kind<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.479> which<00:03:32.290> is

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
little sniper coil kind of which is

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.319 
little sniper coil kind of which is
really<00:03:32.859> tiny<00:03:33.129> but<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.669> would<00:03:33.790> be<00:03:33.819> really

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
really tiny but that would be really

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.330 
really tiny but that would be really
really<00:03:34.569> good<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.229> useful<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.799> you're<00:03:36.010> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
really good and useful if you're you

the<00:05:08.620> f2<00:05:08.949> will<00:05:09.069> do<00:05:09.190> like<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.370> pin<00:05:09.669> point<00:05:10.469> you<00:05:11.469> know

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
the f2 will do like a pin point you know

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.020 
the f2 will do like a pin point you know
you<00:05:11.620> push<00:05:12.039> it<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.310> your<00:05:12.460> thumb<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:12.819> it<00:05:12.879> just

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
you push it on your thumb and it just

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.719 
you push it on your thumb and it just
makes<00:05:13.120> this<00:05:13.240> really<00:05:13.449> loud<00:05:13.629> noise<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:15.460> has

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
makes this really loud noise and it has

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.379 
makes this really loud noise and it has
a<00:05:15.759> depth<00:05:16.169> tells<00:05:17.169> you<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.379> depth<00:05:17.650> or<00:05:18.550> what<00:05:19.300> it

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
a depth tells you the depth or what it

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.119 
a depth tells you the depth or what it
thinks<00:05:19.629> might<00:05:19.870> be<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.169> depth<00:05:20.409> of<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> item

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
thinks might be the depth of the item

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.999 
thinks might be the depth of the item
and<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.430> also<00:05:21.849> has<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.300> it's<00:05:22.569> a<00:05:22.659> 90<00:05:23.139> it's

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
and it also has I think it's a 90 it's

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.580 
and it also has I think it's a 90 it's
either<00:05:24.099> 98<00:05:24.729> or<00:05:25.000> 99<00:05:25.449> target<00:05:25.990> ID<00:05:26.310> from<00:05:27.900> 0<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.020> 99<00:05:29.440> I

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
either 98 or 99 target ID from 0 to 99 I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.719 
either 98 or 99 target ID from 0 to 99 I
think<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:30.009> is<00:05:30.159> so<00:05:30.819> it<00:05:31.000> kind<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.330> gives<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.690> that

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
think it is so it kind of gives you that

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.620 
think it is so it kind of gives you that
video<00:05:33.729> display<00:05:34.389> to<00:05:35.110> tell<00:05:35.349> you<00:05:35.819> what<00:05:36.819> what<00:05:37.539> it

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
video display to tell you what what it

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.450 
video display to tell you what what it
is<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.900> may<00:05:38.139> be<00:05:38.169> digging<00:05:38.620> up<00:05:38.800> which<00:05:39.099> is<00:05:39.250> kind

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
is you may be digging up which is kind

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.800 
is you may be digging up which is kind
of<00:05:39.490> cool<00:05:39.639> but<00:05:39.789> now<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:39.940> Tesoro<00:05:40.330> compadre

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
of cool but now the Tesoro compadre

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.269 
of cool but now the Tesoro compadre
doesn't<00:05:41.110> have<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.409> I<00:05:41.469> mean<00:05:41.680> it's<00:05:41.830> just<00:05:41.889> a<00:05:42.069> box

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
doesn't have that I mean it's just a box

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.969 
doesn't have that I mean it's just a box
no<00:05:43.150> information<00:05:43.779> but<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.080> does<00:05:44.259> have<00:05:44.500> sounds

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
no information but it does have sounds

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.649 
no information but it does have sounds
and<00:05:45.099> from<00:05:45.729> what<00:05:45.849> I<00:05:45.880> understand<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.389> you<00:05:46.509> get

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
and from what I understand if you get

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.269 
and from what I understand if you get
good<00:05:46.900> enough<00:05:47.139> you<00:05:47.440> can<00:05:47.590> just<00:05:47.740> distinguish<00:05:48.130> the

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
good enough you can just distinguish the

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.709 
good enough you can just distinguish the
sounds<00:05:48.789> and<00:05:48.969> you'll<00:05:49.300> know<00:05:49.509> what<00:05:49.599> you're

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
sounds and you'll know what you're

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.269 
sounds and you'll know what you're
digging<00:05:49.960> up<00:05:50.050> already<00:05:50.440> now<00:05:50.710> that's<00:05:50.889> horrible

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
digging up already now that's horrible

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.580 
digging up already now that's horrible
compadre<00:05:51.879> as<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.479> understand<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.020> it's<00:05:53.199> really

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
compadre as I understand it it's really

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.170 
compadre as I understand it it's really
really<00:05:53.949> good<00:05:54.129> at<00:05:54.250> picking<00:05:54.460> up<00:05:54.699> things<00:05:54.969> that

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
really good at picking up things that

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.659 
really good at picking up things that
other<00:05:55.690> machines<00:05:56.110> just<00:05:56.379> don't<00:05:56.560> see<00:05:56.830> I<00:05:57.069> mean<00:05:57.219> the

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
other machines just don't see I mean the

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.459 
other machines just don't see I mean the
F<00:05:57.849> 2<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.389> compadre<00:05:58.840> operate<00:05:59.319> on

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
F 2 and the compadre operate on

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.769 
F 2 and the compadre operate on
different<00:05:59.620> frequencies<00:06:00.490> I<00:06:00.819> think<00:06:01.629> that

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
different frequencies I think that

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.589 
different frequencies I think that
compadre<00:06:02.379> is<00:06:02.469> like<00:06:02.590> around<00:06:02.889> 14<00:06:03.340> or<00:06:03.490> 15<00:06:03.969> and<00:06:04.270> the

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
compadre is like around 14 or 15 and the

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.070 
compadre is like around 14 or 15 and the
F<00:06:04.930> -<00:06:05.340> between<00:06:06.340> 5<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:06.969> 7<00:06:07.360> someone<00:06:07.690> they're<00:06:07.870> from

F - between 5 and 7 someone they're from

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.709 
F - between 5 and 7 someone they're from
this<00:06:08.319> from<00:06:08.500> memory<00:06:08.680> but<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:10.210> can<00:06:10.360> pick<00:06:10.539> up

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719 
this from memory but you can pick up

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.269 
this from memory but you can pick up
with<00:06:10.870> a<00:06:10.930> compadre<00:06:11.319> you<00:06:11.590> can<00:06:11.710> pick<00:06:11.889> up<00:06:12.039> tiny

with a compadre you can pick up tiny
little<00:06:12.490> gold<00:06:12.909> that<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:13.509> may<00:06:13.690> not<00:06:13.870> be<00:06:13.990> able<00:06:14.050> to

the<00:06:29.620> let's<00:06:30.520> say<00:06:30.639> that's<00:06:30.819> the<00:06:30.909> compadre<00:06:31.539> is

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
the let's say that's the compadre is

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.179 
the let's say that's the compadre is
about<00:06:31.779> a<00:06:31.810> hundred<00:06:32.139> and<00:06:32.169> sixty<00:06:32.560> dollars<00:06:32.680> and

about a hundred and sixty dollars and

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.640 
about a hundred and sixty dollars and
the<00:06:33.699> f2<00:06:34.150> is<00:06:34.360> about<00:06:34.569> two<00:06:34.930> hundred<00:06:35.319> dollars

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
the f2 is about two hundred dollars

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.100 
the f2 is about two hundred dollars
depending<00:06:35.979> on<00:06:36.129> what<00:06:36.430> you<00:06:36.550> get<00:06:36.759> with<00:06:36.999> it<00:06:37.150> so<00:06:37.449> 160
