kind of kind of fun LED light bar on the
back<00:02:19.220> as<00:02:19.430> well<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.390> case<00:02:20.840> you're<00:02:21.019> I

don't know guess your
back<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:23.960> now<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:26.390> tire<00:02:26.660> rack<00:02:26.930> looks

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
back it up now this tire rack looks

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.680 
back it up now this tire rack looks
tough<00:02:29.300> as<00:02:29.510> hell<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> it's<00:02:31.310> beefy<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
tough as hell I like it it's beefy the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.380 
tough as hell I like it it's beefy the
problem<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.730> we've<00:02:34.730> lost

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
problem with this is we've lost

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
problem with this is we've lost
I<00:02:35.420> think<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> functionality<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.250> pickup

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
I think the functionality of a pickup

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.770 
I think the functionality of a pickup
truck<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:37.880> we've<00:02:38.090> still<00:02:38.210> got<00:02:38.360> another<00:02:38.510> spare

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
truck and we've still got another spare

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.490 
truck and we've still got another spare
tire<00:02:38.960> down<00:02:39.110> there

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
tire down there

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.530 
tire down there
definitely<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.160> cool<00:02:40.340> look<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:40.820> for<00:02:41.090> me<00:02:41.360> I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
definitely a cool look but for me I

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.750 
definitely a cool look but for me I
would<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.020> would<00:02:42.260> take<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.530> thing<00:02:42.710> off<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
would I would take this thing off and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.460 
would I would take this thing off and
then<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.120> also<00:02:44.270> lose<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.810> tailgate<00:02:45.170> has<00:02:45.320> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
then you also lose the tailgate has the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.130 
then you also lose the tailgate has the
rear<00:02:45.650> vert<00:02:45.860> rear<00:02:46.160> view<00:02:46.400> camera<00:02:46.700> on<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
rear vert rear view camera on it so you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.420 
rear vert rear view camera on it so you
kind<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.380> lost<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.680> as<00:02:48.860> well<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.070> mean<00:02:49.280> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
kind of lost that as well I mean it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100 
kind of lost that as well I mean it
looks<00:02:49.610> cool<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.970> looks<00:02:50.180> tough<00:02:50.420> certainly<00:02:51.050> in

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
looks cool it looks tough certainly in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.960 
looks cool it looks tough certainly in
the<00:02:51.200> right<00:02:51.320> environment<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:52.490> could<00:02:52.640> use<00:02:52.820> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the right environment you could use it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.610 
the right environment you could use it
for<00:02:53.000> doing<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.720> lot<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.080> off-roading

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
for doing a lot of off-roading

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.820 
for doing a lot of off-roading
but<00:02:55.160> for<00:02:55.700> me<00:02:55.820> I'd<00:02:56.780> swap<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.170> thing<00:02:57.350> out<00:02:57.470> but

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
but for me I'd swap this thing out but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.560

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
it is hinged you can pull these pins and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930 
it is hinged you can pull these pins and
swing<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.080> thing<00:03:00.140> out<00:03:00.470> really<00:03:01.460> really<00:03:01.790> kind

of neat stuff

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.890 
of neat stuff
the<00:03:03.740> graphics<00:03:04.250> package<00:03:04.910> like<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.180> said<00:03:05.240> Sherwin

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the graphics package like I said Sherwin

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.260 
the graphics package like I said Sherwin
Williams<00:03:05.930> did<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.440> paint<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.760> go<00:03:07.910> from<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
Williams did the paint to go from the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.020 
Williams did the paint to go from the
from<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.750> shiny<00:03:09.250> blend<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.460> with<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.790> flat

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
from the shiny blend it in with the flat

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.460 
from the shiny blend it in with the flat
black<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.450> think<00:03:11.480> really<00:03:11.810> looks<00:03:12.050> kind<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.290> cool

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
black I think really looks kind of cool

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.090 
black I think really looks kind of cool
the<00:03:13.010> wheels<00:03:13.280> are<00:03:13.490> great<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.380> lights<00:03:15.620> up<00:03:15.830> front

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
the wheels are great the lights up front

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.550 
the wheels are great the lights up front
not<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.180> bright<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> LED<00:03:18.020> bar<00:03:18.230> but

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
not as bright as the LED bar but

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.310 
not as bright as the LED bar but
drivable<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.400> has<00:03:19.580> both<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.360> pinpoint<00:03:21.080> lights

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
drivable it has both the pinpoint lights

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.690 
drivable it has both the pinpoint lights
and<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.890> wide<00:03:23.200> lights<00:03:24.200> which<00:03:24.680> make<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.520> kind

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
and the wide lights which make it kind

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.060 
and the wide lights which make it kind
of<00:03:25.730> fun<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.150> then<00:03:26.210> this<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.200> 6.2<00:03:27.830> liter

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
of fun and then this is the 6.2 liter

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.490 
of fun and then this is the 6.2 liter
and<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:29.090> had<00:03:29.240> a<00:03:29.270> raptor<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.810> long<00:03:30.020> ago<00:03:30.320> which

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
and we had a raptor on long ago which

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.080 
and we had a raptor on long ago which
was<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:30.920> smaller<00:03:31.250> engine<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
was the smaller engine but this is the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.810 
was the smaller engine but this is the
6.2<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> think<00:03:33.140> they're<00:03:33.260> like<00:03:33.410> 411<00:03:34.070> horsepower

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
6.2 I think they're like 411 horsepower

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.960 
6.2 I think they're like 411 horsepower
maybe<00:03:35.180> 412<00:03:35.750> somewhere<00:03:36.140> around<00:03:36.200> there<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
maybe 412 somewhere around there and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.880 
maybe 412 somewhere around there and
this<00:03:37.970> has<00:03:38.120> been<00:03:38.300> brought<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.750> 525<00:03:39.350> like<00:03:39.740> we

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
this has been brought up to 525 like we

Eaton screws in the middle and then the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
they do such a great job with the OE OE

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.789 
they do such a great job with the OE OE
quality<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:59.150> how<00:03:59.300> this<00:03:59.510> works

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
quality of how this works

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.589 
quality of how this works
we<00:04:01.799> have<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.950> boost<00:04:02.189> gauge<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.939> in<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.390> side

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
we have a boost gauge here in the side

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.479 
we have a boost gauge here in the side
and<00:04:03.930> when<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.170> start<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.500> thing<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:07.489> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
and when you start this thing up and

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.759 
and when you start this thing up and
then<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.269> think<00:04:09.540> Roush<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.319> tune<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
then I think Roush has this tune to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.649 
then I think Roush has this tune to
about<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:13.319> about<00:04:13.500> seven<00:04:13.950> or<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.510> seven<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.629> a

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
about to about seven or so seven and a

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.969 
about to about seven or so seven and a
half<00:04:15.720> pounds<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.229> boost<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.650> see<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
half pounds of boost so you see that

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:26.820 
half pounds of boost so you see that
gauge

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.140 

now<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.889> rest<00:04:28.189> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.430> interior<00:04:28.789> I<00:04:28.819> think<00:04:29.030> is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
now the rest of the interior I think is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.739 
now the rest of the interior I think is
pretty<00:04:29.419> much<00:04:29.689> stock<00:04:30.110> but<00:04:30.499> they<00:04:31.219> did<00:04:31.370> add<00:04:31.749> some

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749 
pretty much stock but they did add some

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.779 
pretty much stock but they did add some
