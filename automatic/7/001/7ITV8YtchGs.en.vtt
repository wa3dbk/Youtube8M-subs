00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.180 

the<00:00:02.520> reason<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:02.970> met<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.300> cockeyed<00:00:03.810> angle<00:00:04.259> is

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
the reason I met this cockeyed angle is

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.880 
the reason I met this cockeyed angle is
that<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.580> are<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:07.020> spot<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> needles

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that we are in the spot on the needles

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.629 
that we are in the spot on the needles
by<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.160> way<00:00:08.309> just<00:00:08.550> maybe<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.599> mile<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.580> where<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
by the way just maybe a mile in where it

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.290 
by the way just maybe a mile in where it
goes<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> 1<00:00:12.590> playing<00:00:15.500> stone<00:00:16.500> tunnel<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
goes to a 1 playing stone tunnel and a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
goes to a 1 playing stone tunnel and a
charter<00:00:18.690> bus<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> trying<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.529> through<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
charter bus is trying to get through and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.900 
charter bus is trying to get through and
I<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.359> had<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.869> video<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.910> because

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I just had to get video of this because

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
I just had to get video of this because
like<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.050> can't<00:00:25.590> imagine<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.099> thing<00:00:26.279> was

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
like I can't imagine this thing was

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:48.160 
like I can't imagine this thing was
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> through<00:00:27.060> there

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.460 

and<00:00:48.710> even<00:00:49.040> if<00:00:49.130> he<00:00:49.250> gets<00:00:49.430> through<00:00:50.110> this<00:00:51.110> route

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
and even if he gets through this route

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.090 
and even if he gets through this route
is<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.040> winding<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.350> was<00:00:54.530> clearly<00:00:54.829> in

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
is so winding then and I was clearly in

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.400 
is so winding then and I was clearly in
their<00:00:55.309> way<00:00:55.430> up<00:00:55.610> here<00:00:55.900> then<00:00:56.900> I<00:00:56.930> can't<00:00:57.290> imagine

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
their way up here then I can't imagine

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.020 
their way up here then I can't imagine
inside<00:00:57.949> of<00:00:58.100> us<00:00:58.220> coming<00:00:58.489> through<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.790> because

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
inside of us coming through it because

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.330 
inside of us coming through it because
it's<00:00:59.180> too<00:00:59.360> long<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.930> go<00:01:00.620> around<00:01:00.890> these<00:01:01.100> things

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's too long to go around these things

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.380 
it's too long to go around these things
nothing<00:01:01.879> turns<00:01:02.470> there<00:01:03.470> near<00:01:03.739> hairpin

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.980 

he's<00:01:11.050> obviously<00:01:11.230> making<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.130> but<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.990> wouldn't

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
he's obviously making it but I wouldn't

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:47.790 
he's obviously making it but I wouldn't
want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.260> talk

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:02:29.500 

there

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.270 

and<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.110> people<00:02:30.440> are<00:02:30.590> cheering<00:02:30.890> because<00:02:31.099> he

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and the people are cheering because he

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.180 
and the people are cheering because he
made<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.610> through<00:02:31.730> there<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:35.769> can't<00:02:36.769> believe<00:02:37.040> he

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
made it through there I can't believe he

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.990 
made it through there I can't believe he
made<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.860> someone<00:02:40.129> would<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.549> told<00:02:40.760> me

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
made it that someone would have told me

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.089 
made it that someone would have told me
I<00:02:41.239> would<00:02:42.019> have<00:02:42.260> told<00:02:42.409> him<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.620> were<00:02:42.709> full<00:02:42.950> of

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
I would have told him they were full of

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.250 
I would have told him they were full of
it
