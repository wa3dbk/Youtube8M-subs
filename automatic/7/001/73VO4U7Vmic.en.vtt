00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 good hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.200
 new video tutorial for more tutorial 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.269
 where we will learn how to use 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.759
 whatsapp on our computer in our 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.400
 pc since it's a question that a lot 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 people do is a question that 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.109
 enough people have asked me in the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 last months and enough people want 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.320
 know since there are people who for example 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.699
 do not have your smartphone or 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 anything your tablet and can not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 use whatsapp let's learn to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.610
 use it on the computer what we 're going 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.020
 to need will be two things first 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 the BlueStacks software he writes 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.270
 so if blue stacks here you can 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.410
 see what I have 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.350
 what this software does is create a 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.780
 species or simulates as if we had a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.890
 smartphone or a tablet in our 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.840
 computer 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.730
 and in this way we can use the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.280
 Android operating system we can also 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.260
 to lower the whatsapp we can lower the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.800
 games that you need the games that 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.210
 you want what is the problem that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.700
 possibly many of you have 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.290
 linked your phone number to 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 whatsapp application of your 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 smartphone or your tablet or what 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 you use then what 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.770
 we will create another number 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.320
 virtual to be able to use this 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.909
 whatsapp on our computer this 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.259
 we can link it with our 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.500
 own number so that when by 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.430
 example call us to the number then we 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.710
 calls appear 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.450
 that are made to the name of fonyou the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.880
 We can receive in our own 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 mobile device what is it for? 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.910
 also well it serves us if we 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.930
 we want to give our numbers 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.600
 phone and we need to use the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.900
 whatsapp with some person from which 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.910
 we do not want to give our number we want 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.540
 Do not know it with this number 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.280
 virtual as I say you can use it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.100
 what we need to create our 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.489

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.890
