and<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.200> all<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.470> other<00:02:59.620> exercises<00:02:59.860> now

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and you have all the other exercises now

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.979 
and you have all the other exercises now
we're<00:03:00.430> also<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.760> utilize<00:03:01.060> an<00:03:01.209> 8<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.660> 12

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
we're also going to utilize an 8 to 12

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.320 
we're also going to utilize an 8 to 12
rep<00:03:02.440> range<00:03:02.709> which<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.519> going<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:03.970> mid<00:03:04.120> rep

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
rep range which is going to that mid rep

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.229 
rep range which is going to that mid rep
range<00:03:04.569> as<00:03:04.720> well<00:03:05.019> as<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> 15<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> 20<00:03:06.220> reps<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.819> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
range as well as a 15 to 20 reps and the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.460 
range as well as a 15 to 20 reps and the
reason<00:03:07.569> being<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.200> hits<00:03:08.349> your

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
reason being is that it hits your

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.620 
reason being is that it hits your
muscles<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:08.980> different<00:03:09.370> rep<00:03:09.549> ranges<00:03:10.030> which

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
muscles and different rep ranges which

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.210 
muscles and different rep ranges which
honestly<00:03:11.079> just<00:03:11.349> gives<00:03:11.620> them<00:03:11.709> different<00:03:12.099> um

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
honestly just gives them different um

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.210 
honestly just gives them different um
different<00:03:12.730> areas<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.799> targeting<00:03:14.799> them<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.160> to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
different areas of targeting them so to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.039 
different areas of targeting them so to
speak<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.640> stimulation<00:03:16.269> that's<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.780> word<00:03:16.900> I'm

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
speak of stimulation that's the word I'm

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.259 
speak of stimulation that's the word I'm
looking<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.829> also<00:03:18.610> with<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.879> higher<00:03:19.030> rep

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
looking for and also with the higher rep

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.520 
looking for and also with the higher rep
range<00:03:19.480> you're<00:03:19.629> going<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.840> elicit<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.260> blood

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
range you're going to elicit the blood

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.920 
range you're going to elicit the blood
flow<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.190> speak<00:03:21.459> or<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.849> pump<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.390> in<00:03:22.780> my

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
flow so to speak or the pump and in my

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.539 
flow so to speak or the pump and in my
opinion<00:03:23.079> regardless<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.860> what<00:03:23.950> science<00:03:24.370> says

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
opinion regardless of what science says

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.890 
opinion regardless of what science says
anytime<00:03:24.879> you<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.269> increase<00:03:25.510> blood<00:03:25.840> flow

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
anytime you can increase blood flow

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.900 
anytime you can increase blood flow
that's<00:03:26.769> increasing<00:03:27.370> nutrient<00:03:27.790> delivery

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that's increasing nutrient delivery

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.150 
that's increasing nutrient delivery
getting<00:03:28.510> rid<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.840> lot<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.260> acid<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.829> pumping

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
getting rid of a lot to acid and pumping

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.100 
getting rid of a lot to acid and pumping
stuff<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.579> there<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.000> making<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:31.930> your

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.020 
in one day right and then we have pool
day<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.169> we<00:04:20.410> actually<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.859> two<00:04:21.130> exercises

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
day and we actually have two exercises

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.390 
day and we actually have two exercises
that<00:04:22.270> are<00:04:22.510> essential<00:04:22.960> for<00:04:22.990> pool<00:04:23.229> day<00:04:23.410> the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
that are essential for pool day the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.650 
that are essential for pool day the
first<00:04:24.610> one<00:04:24.789> is<00:04:24.880> going<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> deadlift

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
first one is going to be the deadlift

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.080 
first one is going to be the deadlift
yes<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:26.860> my<00:04:27.070> opinion<00:04:27.400> that's<00:04:27.669> even<00:04:27.940> more

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
yes in my opinion that's even more

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.219 
yes in my opinion that's even more
important<00:04:28.450> than<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.660> Squawk<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.139> are

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
important than the Squawk is are

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.980 
important than the Squawk is are
actually<00:04:29.530> utilizing<00:04:30.010> grip<00:04:30.370> 1<00:04:30.820> &amp;<00:04:30.970> 2<00:04:31.090> 1<00:04:31.539> &amp;<00:04:31.599> 2<00:04:31.780> with

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
actually utilizing grip 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 with

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.719 
actually utilizing grip 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 with
the<00:04:32.080> dead<00:04:32.260> look<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:32.770> interchangeable<00:04:33.039> yeah

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
the dead look it's interchangeable yeah

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.629 
the dead look it's interchangeable yeah
and<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.590> we're<00:04:35.830> going<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.039> do<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.220> deadlift

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
and so we're going to do the deadlift

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.370 
and so we're going to do the deadlift
and<00:04:36.789> we're<00:04:36.970> also<00:04:37.090> going<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.750> ki-moon

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
and we're also going to do the ki-moon

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.710 
and we're also going to do the ki-moon
for<00:04:38.849> back<00:04:39.849> which<00:04:40.090> would<00:04:40.180> be<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.389> pull-ups

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
for back which would be the pull-ups

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.690 
for back which would be the pull-ups
pull-ups<00:04:41.410> so<00:04:41.740> deadlift<00:04:42.099> is<00:04:42.250> actually<00:04:42.550> hip

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
pull-ups so deadlift is actually hip

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.909 
pull-ups so deadlift is actually hip
dominant<00:04:43.150> leg<00:04:43.390> move<00:04:43.630> yeah<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:44.560> it's<00:04:44.830> again

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
dominant leg move yeah and so it's again

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.500 
dominant leg move yeah and so it's again
so<00:04:45.310> where<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.880> stage<00:04:46.090> with

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
so where the stage with

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.810 
so where the stage with
on<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.720> theory<00:04:47.200> of<00:04:47.380> training<00:04:48.010> legs<00:04:48.220> multiple

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
on a theory of training legs multiple

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.190 
on a theory of training legs multiple
times<00:04:49.030> per<00:04:49.150> week<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.660> we're<00:04:49.930> going<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.080> get

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
times per week and we're going to get

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.960 
times per week and we're going to get
asked<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:50.530> question<00:04:50.980> when<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:51.370> we<00:04:51.490> throw<00:04:51.790> in

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
asked this question when do we throw in

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.850 
asked this question when do we throw in
abdominal<00:04:52.660> exercises<00:04:53.110> now<00:04:53.380> one<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.770> argue

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
abdominal exercises now one can argue

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.580 
abdominal exercises now one can argue
that<00:04:54.070> with<00:04:54.370> squats<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:54.970> deadlifts<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:56.350> can

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
that with squats and deadlifts you can

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.040 
that with squats and deadlifts you can
you're<00:04:57.310> actually<00:04:57.670> hitting<00:04:57.820> your<00:04:58.690> core
