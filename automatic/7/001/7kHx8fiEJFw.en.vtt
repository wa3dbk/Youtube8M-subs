 and that it helps and it will not work out exactly well 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.279
 I do not know on the planets the best fish is like 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.870
 says sausage 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.870
 they now will be discussed 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.350
 preservatives nutritional supplements 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.540
 genetically modified soybean and booster 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.580
 flavor to all this hide this 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.520
 main charge to the Russian 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.590
 We decided to find out the wealth of sausage 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.940
 Is this the example of the national standard? 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.430
 Meet the doctoral year of birth 1936 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.760
 there is such a reference book 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.670
 36 years doctoral she is today 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.129
 from the same, nothing has changed 60 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.790
 percent semi fatty pork 35 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.970
 percent beef premium when 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.800
 breaking the go go very big 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.440
 penalties that you never in life 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 don't go for these things 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.370
 the remaining 5 percent 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.379
 carefully read the modern guest 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.040
 acidity regulators extracts 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.170
 spices 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.629
 colorant staining sodium nitrite this 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
 the most deceiver of taste is MSG 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.850
 clarification we went to Moscow 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.310
 score 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.190
 Oryol farmers supplements such as 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.960
 sodium nitrate monosodium glutamate phosphate 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.270
 sodium is all added to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.130
 decorate the kind of product and so that it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.170
 longer stored on store shelves 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.560
 in our case we do not use it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.320
 us production is completely 347 days 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 some items 14 days that is by 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.020
 deadlines 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.160
 everything else is all very fast 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.620
 spoiling product 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.510
 farmer can't feed all of Moscow 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.790
 check what happens on large 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.740
 enterprises this year permits 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.550
 for example monosodium glutamate flavor enhancer 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.370
 and aroma 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.810
 an explicit child of the era of hamburgers is considered 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.640
 that he makes us eat more 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 causes fullness and serves as a wonderful 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.500
 camouflage for low-quality raw materials 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.770
 let's say the amount of the whole and a half 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.030
 gram per average person per day 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.400
 we add to the sausage 50 grams per 100 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.230
 kilogram no harmful food additives 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 for our viewers we decided to find 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.570
 really natural sausage 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.060
 company mister borodina not use 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 flavor enhancers so meat which we 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.600
 use 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.990
 preparations 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.970
 sea sausages 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.060
 passes the stage of preliminary shashev 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.160
 within 24 hours the meat quarrel with 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.230
 nitrite salt and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.810
 meat 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.690
 reveals your taste and accordingly 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.090
 sausage is obtained natural meat 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 call the taste enhancer from she 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.730
 dozing 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.530
 Of course, such production requires 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.820
 more time and spices should be 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 expensive and real 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.680
 but the position of the owners of the local Tom Borodina 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 out of it businessmen should be anywhere 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.960
 head only one change life 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.010
 consumer to better 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.380
 this is not my idea this is canon here if not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.910
 from then it means you not for long 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.160
 so just follow the laws of business 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.760
 marketing law branding it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.740
 lump so in sausage meat there is a choice 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.390
 for you and next thursday in our 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.350
