00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
like that yet the levels will get

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.110 
like that yet the levels will get
progressively<00:02:14.860> harder<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:17.350> find<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> coins

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
progressively harder to find the coins

showing<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.269> could<00:03:13.420> fall<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.080> first

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
showing you you could fall in the first

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710 
showing you you could fall in the first
maze<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.420> expands<00:03:16.420> on<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
maze and then this one expands on the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.910 
maze and then this one expands on the
idea<00:03:16.989> showing<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.530> you're<00:03:17.709> gonna<00:03:17.769> have

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
to jump over gaps you need to watch

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.190 
to jump over gaps you need to watch
corners<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.830> might<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.400> come<00:03:21.640> get<00:03:22.390> on

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
corners you might have to come get on

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.080 
corners you might have to come get on
coins<00:03:23.500> while<00:03:23.920> jumping<00:03:24.190> over<00:03:24.519> holes<00:03:24.760> are

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
coins while jumping over holes are

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.300 
coins while jumping over holes are
trying<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.840> aim<00:03:25.959> for<00:03:25.989> small<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.769> pedestals

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
trying to aim for small little pedestals

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.890 
trying to aim for small little pedestals
like<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.610> without<00:03:27.700> falling<00:03:28.209> off<00:03:28.360> who<00:03:28.750> I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
like that without falling off who I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.330 
like that without falling off who I
almost<00:03:29.110> fell<00:03:31.140> it's<00:03:32.140> also<00:03:32.350> implements<00:03:33.220> this

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
almost fell it's also implements this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.539 
almost fell it's also implements this
idea<00:03:33.850> right<00:03:34.180> here<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.780> there<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.500> be

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
idea right here that there can be

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.800 
idea right here that there can be
multi-level<00:03:36.549> mazes<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.970> mazes

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
multi-level mazes and as the mazes

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.620 
multi-level mazes and as the mazes
increase<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.709> get<00:03:42.160> way<00:03:42.340> harder<00:03:42.700> this

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
increase and get way harder this

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.479 
increase and get way harder this
multi-story<00:03:44.380> thing<00:03:44.709> here<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.280> play

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
multi-story thing here is going to play

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.199 
multi-story thing here is going to play
a<00:03:45.519> big<00:03:45.790> role<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:47.280> coins<00:03:48.280> here<00:03:48.549> this<00:03:49.000> one's

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
a big role in that coins here this one's

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.699 
a big role in that coins here this one's
straight<00:03:49.450> forward<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:49.989> almost<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.470> path

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
straight forward it's almost like a path

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.009 
straight forward it's almost like a path
there's<00:03:51.190> only<00:03:51.910> one<00:03:52.030> little<00:03:52.390> spot<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.959> you

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
there's only one little spot that you

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.920 
there's only one little spot that you
can<00:03:53.200> get<00:03:53.620> off

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
can get off

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.569 
can get off
and<00:03:55.620> then<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.829> just<00:03:55.920> walk<00:03:56.099> into<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.430> finish

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and then you just walk into the finish
