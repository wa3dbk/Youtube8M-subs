00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
so i don't really like to wear lipstick

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.180 
so i don't really like to wear lipstick
that<00:03:06.769> much<00:03:07.159> it's<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.549> mostly<00:03:07.790> glitter<00:03:08.299> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
that much it's just mostly glitter I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.080 
that much it's just mostly glitter I
don't<00:03:10.190> know<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.400> guys<00:03:10.549> really<00:03:10.700> can't<00:03:10.970> see

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
don't know you guys really can't see

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.349 
don't know you guys really can't see
that<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.420> I'll<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.879> put<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.090> my<00:03:14.209> lips

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
that but I'll just put it on my lips

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.180 
that but I'll just put it on my lips
it's<00:03:14.569> very<00:03:14.780> glittery<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.409> it's<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.829> lot<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.099> fun

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
it's very glittery and it's a lot of fun

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's very glittery and it's a lot of fun
so<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.669> carry<00:03:16.849> this<00:03:16.970> around<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.419> just<00:03:17.599> wear

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
so I can carry this around and just wear

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.539 
so I can carry this around and just wear
it<00:03:17.989> instead<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.440> lip<00:03:18.739> gloss<00:03:18.769> because<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.459> so

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
it instead of lip gloss because it's so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.689 
it instead of lip gloss because it's so
moisturizing<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:21.680> not<00:03:21.919> too<00:03:22.190> dramatic

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
moisturizing and it's not too dramatic

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.759 
moisturizing and it's not too dramatic
but<00:03:22.879> it<00:03:23.180> does<00:03:23.359> add<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.629> little<00:03:23.900> bit<00:03:24.109> of<00:03:24.169> pink<00:03:24.470> and

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
but it does add a little bit of pink and

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.640 
but it does add a little bit of pink and
it<00:03:25.730> adds<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.660> lot<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.900> glitter<00:03:27.199> and<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.470> love

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
it adds a lot of glitter and I love

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:41.430 
it adds a lot of glitter and I love
glitter<00:03:27.859> so<00:03:28.190> it's<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.639> fun<00:03:28.940> look<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.419> love<00:03:29.959> this

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.130 

and<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:42.740> I<00:03:43.040> ended<00:03:44.030> up<00:03:44.120> at<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.420> mac<00:03:44.599> store<00:03:44.630> and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
and then I ended up at the mac store and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.170 
and then I ended up at the mac store and
I<00:03:45.170> didn't<00:03:45.440> buy<00:03:45.560> anything<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:46.340> terms<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.819> makeup

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
I didn't buy anything in terms of makeup

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.330 
I didn't buy anything in terms of makeup
but<00:03:47.360> i<00:03:47.720> did<00:03:48.050> get<00:03:48.170> another<00:03:48.440> palette<00:03:48.830> because<00:03:48.950> i

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
but i did get another palette because i

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.880 
but i did get another palette because i
can't<00:03:49.760> really<00:03:50.030> fit<00:03:50.390> my<00:03:50.780> eyeshadows<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.530> my

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
can't really fit my eyeshadows in my

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.880 
can't really fit my eyeshadows in my
makeup<00:03:52.190> storage<00:03:52.640> bin<00:03:53.300> anymore<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.020> I<00:03:54.260> could

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
makeup storage bin anymore and I could

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.410 
makeup storage bin anymore and I could
just<00:03:55.069> get<00:03:55.220> another<00:03:55.430> makeup<00:03:55.730> storage<00:03:56.120> bin

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
just get another makeup storage bin

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.260 
just get another makeup storage bin
which<00:03:57.050> would<00:03:57.200> be<00:03:57.350> another<00:03:58.280> solution<00:03:58.550> but<00:03:59.060> I

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
which would be another solution but I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.110 
which would be another solution but I
just<00:03:59.690> feel<00:03:59.870> like<00:03:59.900> if<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.860> depart<00:04:01.250> them<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.580> can<00:04:01.819> go

last<00:06:15.020> thing<00:06:15.170> i<00:06:15.320> got<00:06:15.350> was<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:16.340> pair<00:06:16.700> of<00:06:16.790> pants<00:06:17.030> and

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
last thing i got was a pair of pants and

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.060 
last thing i got was a pair of pants and
they're<00:06:18.110> really<00:06:18.260> not<00:06:18.440> that<00:06:18.590> interesting<00:06:19.040> but

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
they're really not that interesting but

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.100 
they're really not that interesting but
I<00:06:19.340> called<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.850> lining<00:06:20.120> anyway<00:06:20.870> they<00:06:21.050> were

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
I called this lining anyway they were

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.470 
I called this lining anyway they were
from<00:06:21.380> H&amp;M<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:22.040> was<00:06:22.160> pouring<00:06:22.610> rain<00:06:22.880> in<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:23.270> city

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
from H&amp;M it was pouring rain in the city

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.940 
from H&amp;M it was pouring rain in the city
and<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.780> was<00:06:23.900> freezing<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.470> my<00:06:24.590> pants<00:06:24.920> were

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
and I was freezing and my pants were

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.650 
and I was freezing and my pants were
soaked<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.850> rest<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.060> me<00:06:26.180> was<00:06:26.300> soaked<00:06:26.480> too

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
soaked and the rest of me was soaked too

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.150 
soaked and the rest of me was soaked too
but<00:06:26.840> I<00:06:26.870> don't<00:06:27.110> want<00:06:27.230> to<00:06:27.290> buy<00:06:27.380> an<00:06:27.500> entire<00:06:27.710> outfit

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
but I don't want to buy an entire outfit

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.520 
but I don't want to buy an entire outfit
so<00:06:28.640> these<00:06:28.760> pants<00:06:29.090> were<00:06:29.210> twenty<00:06:29.630> dollars<00:06:30.020> so

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
so these pants were twenty dollars so

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.800 
so these pants were twenty dollars so
they're<00:06:31.130> just<00:06:31.370> they're<00:06:31.850> skinny<00:06:32.240> jeans<00:06:32.570> I

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
they're just they're skinny jeans I

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.540 
they're just they're skinny jeans I
would<00:06:33.080> walk<00:06:33.230> back<00:06:33.470> but<00:06:33.770> they're<00:06:34.220> really<00:06:34.250> just

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
would walk back but they're really just

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.550 
would walk back but they're really just
plain<00:06:35.270> black<00:06:35.630> skinny<00:06:35.990> jeans<00:06:36.050> and<00:06:36.350> I<00:06:36.410> actually

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
plain black skinny jeans and I actually

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.930 
plain black skinny jeans and I actually
don't<00:06:36.920> have<00:06:37.130> them<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.370> think<00:06:37.520> they're<00:06:37.760> going<00:06:37.880> to

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
don't have them I think they're going to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.150 
don't have them I think they're going to
be<00:06:38.090> pretty<00:06:38.240> useful<00:06:38.480> and<00:06:38.930> I<00:06:39.350> actually<00:06:39.680> do

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
be pretty useful and I actually do

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.740 
be pretty useful and I actually do
really<00:06:40.190> like<00:06:40.610> them<00:06:40.850> but<00:06:41.000> they<00:06:41.060> were<00:06:41.180> kind<00:06:41.600> of

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
really like them but they were kind of

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.390 
really like them but they were kind of
emergency<00:06:42.080> pants<00:06:42.590> I<00:06:42.710> did<00:06:42.860> not<00:06:42.980> want<00:06:43.220> to<00:06:43.250> go

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
emergency pants I did not want to go

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.220 
emergency pants I did not want to go
into<00:06:43.610> New<00:06:44.180> York<00:06:44.420> store<00:06:44.630> and<00:06:44.810> buy<00:06:44.900> a<00:06:44.930> pair<00:06:45.170> of

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
into New York store and buy a pair of

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.540 
into New York store and buy a pair of
sweatpants<00:06:45.650> or<00:06:45.800> anything<00:06:46.130> like<00:06:46.160> that<00:06:46.280> because

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
sweatpants or anything like that because

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.400 
sweatpants or anything like that because
that<00:06:46.880> would<00:06:47.480> just<00:06:47.510> be<00:06:47.660> a<00:06:47.750> waste<00:06:47.840> of<00:06:48.110> money<00:06:48.170> and

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
that would just be a waste of money and

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.320 
that would just be a waste of money and
these<00:06:48.710> were<00:06:48.860> probably<00:06:49.070> cheaper<00:06:49.760> and<00:06:50.000> I<00:06:50.150> like

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
these were probably cheaper and I like

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.430 
these were probably cheaper and I like
them<00:06:50.480> a<00:06:50.510> lot<00:06:50.660> more<00:06:50.870> and<00:06:51.050> I'm<00:06:51.140> going<00:06:51.290> to<00:06:51.320> wear

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
them a lot more and I'm going to wear

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.140 
them a lot more and I'm going to wear
them<00:06:51.560> all<00:06:51.710> the<00:06:51.740> time<00:06:51.830> so<00:06:52.190> I'm<00:06:52.670> really<00:06:52.880> happy
