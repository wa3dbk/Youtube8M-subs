do hands-on this but uh yeah here's the
results<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.620> can<00:01:25.830> focus<00:01:26.730> on<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:28.310> difference

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
results if I can focus on a difference

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
results if I can focus on a difference
between<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.620> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> like

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
between that one down is kind of like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.210 
between that one down is kind of like
just<00:01:32.370> dirty<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:34.380> one's<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.010> little

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
just dirty and that one's just a little

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
just dirty and that one's just a little
wider<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.740> uh<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:39.020> think<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
wider you know but uh I think the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.620 
wider you know but uh I think the
biggest<00:01:40.320> improvement<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.280> probably<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.090> if

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
biggest improvement is probably like if

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
biggest improvement is probably like if
you<00:01:42.810> compare<00:01:43.410> it<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.830> sides<00:01:46.490> like<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you compare it to the sides like this is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.530 
you compare it to the sides like this is
brighter<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.300> tell

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
brighter than that you can really tell

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.350 
brighter than that you can really tell
the<00:01:54.630> difference<00:01:54.660> between<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:56.180> see<00:01:57.180> how

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the difference between that see how

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.810 
the difference between that see how
bright<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.690> is

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
bright that is

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.660 
bright that is
and<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.690> mean<00:02:05.180> big<00:02:06.180> difference<00:02:06.660> I
