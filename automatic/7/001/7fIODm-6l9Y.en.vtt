 headings and deliveries 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.980
 Crystal Ball School 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
 I have to present my story in the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 Journal of school before 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.910
 exclusive of the gems swarm by 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.910
 the fangs the tula gems beat me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.350
 how strange I did not even know that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 were writing 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.720
 I assure you is the key is a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.250
 dragon claw or a faucet joke or 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.510
 Pen is not claw tap 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.510
 dragon when 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.199
 that does not look like a dress 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.469
 and the exclusive double 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.469
 say cheese 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.020
 i 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.480
 not the gems the tula won me from 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 new but since they are not even here 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.020
 it was better to go to the gym the squadron 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.040
 zombie is playing the final with the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.920
 writing the story and I'll put the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 score at the last second 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.610
 the burned tula will not win me this time 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.649
 the twins beat me again and 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.899
 they sent the story five minutes ago 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.920
 that does not make sense the game ended 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.300
 two seconds ago and tell me look at the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.130
 zombies win 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.830

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.080
 polish flash of unemployment brad the each 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.980
 work shows the future that is weird 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.960

 what they are doing here are witnesses 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.330
 so that interviews about what the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.490
 recovery of the screaming ball no 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.160
 I knew the news before it happened 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:56.450
 maybe they want to see on the ball what's going to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.450
 I go then to know what will 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.390
 the twins in trouble again brad
