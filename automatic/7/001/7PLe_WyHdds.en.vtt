 first 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.309
 today he turned mistake let me introduce myself 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.440
 Can you speak badly on the ball and then, personally? 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.449
 said on rio galera 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.309
 now I will win here from you here as 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.690
 always the channel of the two will be here

 in the general description has already appeared in several 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.890
 channel videos he is already the first time 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.350
 who is recording with it and it is 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.870
 recommended next rlt everything was ok 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.400
 on average, it's delicious here with our 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.540
 Guys, I did not want to say no, but it's 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.740
 ours is not them and I threw the guy is not 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.980
 out 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.870
 I killed him, he will not stay I will 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.630
 explain why this map has 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.400
 that being is was the gta to have the nitro that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.600
 if anyone not only in vertical design 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.820
 How crazy is it that it did not work again? 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
 looking like our tail war 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.380
 subsidy here and so our area because 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.450
 after a profit I could not 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.910
 pick up the checkpoint is still too early 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.590
 to speak to sister and three kilometers from 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.840
 track the pilot is the guy who takes nina 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.510
 to the ballad with its surroundings 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.900
 logic winding a funk of 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 voice in one has to have 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.860
 they make our a steal a car 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.780
 fish woman with second place but no 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.190
 very fuck this map guys are super 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.930
 recommended 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.060
 you saw what is the instant 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.500
 project aline is green with the project well 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.290
 I've done a track similar to that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.420
 which is more than a thousand fitch is more than a thousand 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.920
 feet of height 300 meters which is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.660
 considered the largest of the game but I think 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.880
 this super hero here 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.800
 Who has dishes and this camera here? 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.750
 woman who knew about the points to 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.640
 team has to let the car fell crazy 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.070
 man believes at night is this 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.560
 at noon our lady made a 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.780
 goal the church first record no 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.060

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.180
 How is he? But okay with her. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.080
 relax and third, the channels can 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.750
 really doing was what was the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.330
 Our best took second place without 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.520
 insulated sleeves so I told our 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.130
 lane I'm going to have to be sure here guys 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.470
 arrives in a rover and chery that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.140
 car would I know if I 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.820
 like this very legal national map 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.010
 always when I really liked 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.040
 It's good that I put 40 laps 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.840
 has it that wins who in the second 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.390
 first maybe the first hole 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.130
 maybe oil maybe arrived 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.780
 bora otoni trolo 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.980
 Let's take a bookstore in project. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.960

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.480
 who will win here for the first time in 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.270
 television is what woman would have to 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.360
 No, but who's going to win the game there? 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:50.290
 each map that falls there must navigate 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.110
 on the ramp have to win the galera ours is 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.730

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.990
 explosions continue 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.280
