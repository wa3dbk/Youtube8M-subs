00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
same type of shimmery finish so it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.810 
same type of shimmery finish so it
blends<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.469> last<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.579> really

nicely and then I'm going to take defy
which<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.689> most<00:02:03.840> beautiful<00:02:04.490> dark<00:02:05.490> grey

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
which is the most beautiful dark grey

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.479 
which is the most beautiful dark grey
shade<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.079> lot<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.350> depth<00:02:07.799> than<00:02:08.069> just

blue<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.459> purple<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.239> think

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
blue and purple in it I think

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.680 
blue and purple in it I think
it's<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:12.920> really<00:02:13.130> beautiful<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.630> i'm

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's really really beautiful so i'm

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.210 
it's really really beautiful so i'm

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
putting that on the outer one third is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.310 
putting that on the outer one third is
patting<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.730> into<00:02:16.940> place<00:02:17.180> that's<00:02:17.840> actually<00:02:18.080> a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
patting it into place that's actually a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.290 
patting it into place that's actually a
brush<00:02:18.680> from<00:02:18.860> ELF<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.460> here<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.120> very

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
small brush from Kevin tequan but that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.310 
small brush from Kevin tequan but that
wasn't<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.270> working<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.080> went<00:02:24.230> back

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
to my Sigma e25 and really worked it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.580 
to my Sigma e25 and really worked it
into<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.310> transition<00:02:29.180> area<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.810> soften<00:02:30.470> that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590

more than just using a light gray or

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.670 
more than just using a light gray or
black<00:02:43.180> taking<00:02:44.180> angel<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.870> kind<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.230> smooth

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
this is an Universal so it should work

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
this is an Universal so it should work
for<00:03:26.810> anyone<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.320> just<00:03:27.530> it's<00:03:28.160> too<00:03:28.370> dark<00:03:28.790> for
