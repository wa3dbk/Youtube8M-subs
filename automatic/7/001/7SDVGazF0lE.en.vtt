00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 Good people are giving continuity to 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.860
 second part of the video 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 right now it declined but it was the night to 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.470
 to clarify some doubts in the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 The team may have stayed because they're doing it. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 emerging think not pay attention 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.050
 well no one said 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.050
 all things correct that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.230
 this was the marketing with a tank of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:46.110
 fuel 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.239
 356 and 400 as it was to achieve this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 brand 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.920
 good first thing I want 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.690
 She ended up leaving here. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 the fuel tank of the car that does not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.670
 It's 50 liters of fuel to stay here. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 is 40 liters 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:14.850
 because this is what I used when I filled it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.460
 the streep tank ae b 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 that's when I left about 10 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 liters lessened the pampered tank 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.790
 least four or five bars and I 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.140
 I filled it again, certain it was sic 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 when you fill the normal tank 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.560
 01 2 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:47.020
 e rolled about a 90 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.540
 kilometers and totally kicked opera 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.110
 You'll see if the tank stays that way. 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.630
 functionally 50 liters 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 he is to make this mother that with a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.070
 fuel tank 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:06.460
 as she only 40 he does it here is that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.990
 I did the valve adjustment to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:16.590
 more important the day before 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:22.300
 He made the exchange of emission candles 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.960
 exchange of fuel and air filter in 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.290
 same car engine you can see that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.070
 after the 50 thousand kilometers 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.550
 the round is to be exchanged for the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.830
 ignitions and also guides the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.959
 valve adjustment 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.260
 That's what I did, but I did not do it. 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.850
 concessionaire he did not know would have 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.280
 even told me not to trust service 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.800
 concessionaire must take 11 office and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.410
 I trust those who teach classes 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.050
 came in the woods other pieces and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.360
 expeditionary 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.750
 I spoke with a renato mechanic renato 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.959
 made a new report for me and now 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.510
 I was satisfied and thus remembering the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:20.530
 I got past this shit that I 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 I did was an average road plus and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.780
 rapid transit would be rapid transit 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.860
 a thing that also consumes a little bit of 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.890
 fuel 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.280
 at least in that car here are you do 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.860
 is to have small resources 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.140
 my job is very very close here 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.830
 in my house and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.110
 when I do not go to other places it is 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.420
 from home to work and work to 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.819
 home then the lans does not give any time 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.490
 of the car to warm up right 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.500
 I already arrived at work and when I 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.150
 I left work and came home the same 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.800
 thing then it also hurt a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.930
 little consumption at least in that car 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.890
 who makes small paths 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.910
 now I'm going to record the third part of 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.200
 video 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.180
 briefly what I'm going to do 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.709
 the average of this car here totally in 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.300
 road or take a trip now to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.280
 next week and I think I'm glad 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.840
 fuel I should make a good average 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.070
 and I'll show you the tank bushel. 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.520
 and will run until end until the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.130
 reservation and then I'll see how much of d 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.290
 she goes after I did here're giving 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.919
 doctor made almost 9 with 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.210
 the liter 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.700
 remembering that the year always in the air 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:00.370
 Direct conditioning does not lower the finger to 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:02.620
 nothing ever in the air conditioner and it was 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.470
 the one that followed him a little 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.479
 on the road but I think that after 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.090
 half the fuel 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.320
 I was running small paths only from the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.090
 work for home 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.760
 in the house of work 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.800
 and still got the average is 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.540
 good about 10 with milk with this 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.360
 Car here for who this guy is. 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:29.419
 doing a maximum of 465 and now I'm 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.449
 with that one came back a little satisfied 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.949
 now with cigarette smoking car 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.949
 very good stable comfortable 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.770
 certain is it folks the saw now 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.740
 purpose of halting the third party when 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.790
 I made the trip to see his consumption . 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.790
 totally on the road
