00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
bad players because you would lose a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.020 
bad players because you would lose a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
say fifa 14 was the worst thief i've

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.310 
say fifa 14 was the worst thief i've
ever<00:02:32.280> played<00:02:32.460> my<00:02:32.670> life<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.690> terms<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
ever played my life but in terms of the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.080 
ever played my life but in terms of the
actual<00:02:34.500> gameplay<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> way<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> players

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
actual gameplay and the way the players

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.600 
actual gameplay and the way the players
felt<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.900> ball<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.890> was<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.370> really

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
felt on the ball it was a really really

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.800 
felt on the ball it was a really really
good<00:02:38.820> game<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.420> better<00:02:39.540> than<00:02:39.690> few

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
good game I think it's better than few

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.590 
good game I think it's better than few
of<00:02:39.900> 15<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> wasn't<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.390> dramatic<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
of 15 because it wasn't so dramatic and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780 
of 15 because it wasn't so dramatic and
over<00:02:43.200> emphasized<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> touches<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.610> stuff

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
over emphasized on the touches and stuff

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.449 
over emphasized on the touches and stuff
like<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.390> 15<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.260> too<00:02:46.530> much<00:02:46.680> touches

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
like they in 15 I do too much touches

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.800 
like they in 15 I do too much touches
it's<00:02:47.760> kind<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.240> stupid<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.690> my<00:02:48.720> opinion

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's kind of stupid in my opinion

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's kind of stupid in my opinion
because<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> video<00:02:49.709> game<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
because in a video game it's like it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
because in a video game it's like it
ruins<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> aspects<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.620> reaction<00:02:52.620> time<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
ruins the aspects of reaction time and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.220 
ruins the aspects of reaction time and
all<00:02:53.489> those<00:02:53.700> basics<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.239> make<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> good<00:02:54.780> player<00:02:55.020> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
all those basics I make a good player a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.930 
all those basics I make a good player a
good<00:02:55.260> player<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.070> that's<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> conclude

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
good player so that's going to conclude

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.729 
good player so that's going to conclude
