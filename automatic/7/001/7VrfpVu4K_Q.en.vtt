 It caught the attention that a cross team 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.250
 importance in Reynosa that I said do not

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.570
 truth how can you also get some 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.740
 other ideas for example here is 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.440
 Here is a picture that I took from the game 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 past of the team of tigers at the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.330
 of at the level of the court true and has 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 has its all everything look there is what 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.170
 I know what I took out 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.259
 what is that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.790
 It's a picture with my great friend Willie 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.610
 gonzález 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.050
 we go there in the stadium of 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 volcano was very cold those are 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.790
 the things that I took from television that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.010
 obviously I like nature and the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 I took it there but I'm still taking it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.030
 many things 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.400
 I take many things look are what I keep 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.700
 me in my on my phone on my phone 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.399
 I have more than 4,000 pictures imagine 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 everything to entertain me a good time not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.330
 but it turns out that it also has video 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.680
 and also has to record voice and to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 record everything you want and a cell phone 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.819
 it's practically a weapon 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.680
 true 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.230
 chacón as professional arbitrator 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.799
 he has to have an ethic and a respect 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.590
 above all, the referees' school 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:45.239
 he climbed into a truck here and a person 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.469
 in bad faith he put the cellphone directly 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.569
 towards him so that to get him soup but 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:55.079
 be you what is that there are no people 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.780
 advantageous that the video has there and we're going 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.120
 to get him that for chacon and they start him 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.299
 to talk to chacón and soup 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.540
 talking to him about don robert del viejito don 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.120
 Robert and Chacón throw me an amount 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.439
 of nonsense of which you are 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.919
 to be witnesses and then say such things 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:20.219
 as they did not give a final and there is a 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:23.010
 little bit angry is very brief what I 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.680
 they sent the person who took the picture me 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.349
 he sent her with his cousin who also 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.060
 love the one who speaks in which 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.180
 talk about you in which they speak ill of you 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.140
 and now donne brother enzar tc well 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.600
 what 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.770
 I have been told what he told me 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.780
 chacón 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.270
 every day they tell me 100 people in 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.430
 the program so it does not hurt me 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.790
 I do not hurt but for the school of 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.520
 referees who knows what can happen 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.070
 let's hear the first part not the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.830
 first part for the first time in the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:01.310
 program the video that was taken to 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.310
 chacón that took the monterrey to japan 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.460
 the two teams 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.080
 mother with me 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.080
 the artists do not lose with me doing 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.970
 I do not know how much 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.070
 the end 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.390
 concreted 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.720
 culero rod is a very used word 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.780
 in Mexico to offend a person is 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:56.420
 he tells him so for that reason he became famous 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.340
 the scream of uh lero lero are aggression is 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.800
 an offense what they say to the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.340
 referees when they want to protest 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.500
 that good way we're going to repeat it 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.320
 because it was not very clear in the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.480
 public and drew attention to them but 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.360
 the best are left with things that are not 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.340
 very clear, it seems good, we are going to 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.370
 but yes, look, I want to 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.060
 warn I want to warn you get so 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.880
 bad faith the recording to chacón that when 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.830
 says that virgilio who I know that the 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.040
 person laughs of 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.350
 satisfaction as saying already fell already 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.569
 offended the one I wanted them to offend 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.270
 truth is clear 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:44.759
 so clear is it clear is it clear is yes or 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.069
 yes bad milk bad milk bad milk 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.199
 milk from him and the one who brought the video here 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.469
 the channel that brought the video to the 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:56.090
 channel brought it with the signal that it 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:59.090
 laugh from don robert and ami 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.940
 good so I say respectable 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.540
 public let's go to a commercial break and 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.540
