00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello mo internet and cordial 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.509
 welcome to the works council tv with 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.919
 Great power comes with great responsibility 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.570
 this claim is not only valid for 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.610
 spiderman but also for works councils 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 now works councils do not have much 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.230
 But there are a few things where he is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.270
 Nobody can talk into it 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 theme exemption that is also such a topic 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
 where works councils and employers the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.390
 company constitution law completely wrong 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 understood as one reads then somehow from 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.789
 a certain size of one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 works council is a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 member of the works council completely from the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 work free yes and we expect 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.020
 they can do that a bit 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 exempt the so a bit 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.829
 indemnify the thing does not hit quite 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.770
 That's the way every works council is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.870
 may be required for 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 his works council work from the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.450
 normal work is free that means 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 not just for the works council meeting 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.719
 or if you guess one now 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 company meeting prepared or something 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.100
 No, that's not just how you're there 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.629
 somehow one or two types in the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.520
 works council all the work on 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.530
 but if that work in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.030
 works council then gives you the done 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 also and how do I do that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.010
 I give to my boss or team leader 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.250
 or project manager, and you say so 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.650
 do some works council work then says 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 he 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.390
 how long as long as that is possible or 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.040
 which one makes into the works council office then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.180
 works ie you have no one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.799
 ask for permission 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.060
 You just do it and we do it 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.130
 Do not want to ask anyone for permission 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.600
 must come here also the responsibility 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 in the game in principle we would have the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 possibilities after a durchzechten 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.990
 to say night in the morning you can manage 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.759
 i do where the works council work and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 then the new office and drums leave 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 First of all, nobody can 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.560
 contradict yourself somehow 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.509
 your net I net against net you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 you have chosen the possibility now 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.189
 has to indemnify yourselves 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.270
 so go with this power 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.009
 Responsibly around us for the time being 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 there are no exemptions 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.200
 limit 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.780
 yes there is in the works constitution law 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 there is one in there maybe 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 completely free but the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.979
 certain size you can also 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.009
 Completely leave for a week two 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.020
 weeks three weeks four weeks 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.730
 provided her work as a works council too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 to do 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.880
 I could only do it for half 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.250
 hour free but you could 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.050
 say business you have me again 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.130
 a lot of shit installed I have so now 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.600
 really busy 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.730
 you'll see me the next 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.130
 unfortunately not at work 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.630
 that is power and with that you go 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.070
 responsibly 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.710
 because if someday I will 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.600
 We are talking about works council Meyer goes 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.120
 back to the office around 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.000
 to sleep off and drink coffee and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.310
 then your support will be in the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.950
 staff also sometime against zero 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.960
