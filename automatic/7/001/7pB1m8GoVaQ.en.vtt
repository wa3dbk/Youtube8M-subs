because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> wanted<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.299> enough<00:01:55.009> still

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
because I wanted it to be enough still

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.889 
because I wanted it to be enough still
really<00:01:56.219> tacky<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.240> painting<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.630> several

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
really tacky on my painting it several

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.880 
really tacky on my painting it several
hours<00:01:58.049> ago<00:01:59.329> but<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.590> did<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> lot<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
hours ago but it's kind of did a lot of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.899 
hours ago but it's kind of did a lot of
drying<00:02:02.219> too<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> cut<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
drying too but I had to cut some of the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.369 
drying too but I had to cut some of the
brackets<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:08.629> here<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
brackets off on this thing here so I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.260 
brackets off on this thing here so I
could<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.430> thing<00:02:11.550> under<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
could get this thing under but this

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.839 
could get this thing under but this
thing<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.750> really<00:02:13.020> bolted<00:02:13.500> on

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
thing is like really bolted on

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.000 
thing is like really bolted on
so<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.930> don't<00:02:15.049> really<00:02:15.109> put<00:02:15.379> much<00:02:15.530> weight<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:15.920> in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
so we don't really put much weight on in

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.250 
so we don't really put much weight on in
any<00:02:16.159> way<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:16.939> gonna<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.329> like<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
any way so it's not gonna be like you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.690 
any way so it's not gonna be like you
know<00:02:18.290> we're<00:02:18.560> putting<00:02:18.829> like<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> million<00:02:19.340> pounds

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
know we're putting like a million pounds

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.339 
know we're putting like a million pounds
on<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.849> front<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.239> thing<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.170> don't

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
on the front of that thing so we don't

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.259 
on the front of that thing so we don't
really<00:02:21.439> need<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.650> keep<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.099> brackets<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:23.239> I

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
really need to keep the brackets so I

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.849 
really need to keep the brackets so I
just<00:02:23.450> took<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.629> brackets<00:02:24.109> off<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.560> and

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
just took the brackets off and and

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.910 
just took the brackets off and and
bolted<00:02:25.639> bring<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.269> bolt<00:02:26.659> layer<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.530> bolt<00:02:27.739> on

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
bolted bring a bolt layer and a bolt on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.739 
bolted bring a bolt layer and a bolt on
the<00:02:28.040> other<00:02:28.219> side<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:28.819> threaded<00:02:29.659> it

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:29.749 
the other side and just threaded it

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.569 
the other side and just threaded it
right<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.139> to<00:02:30.319> where<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.650> things<00:02:31.129> are<00:02:31.370> it's

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
right in to where the things are it's

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.729 
right in to where the things are it's
kind<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.819> kind<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.359> cool<00:02:32.629> but<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.260> didn't<00:02:33.590> take

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
kind of kind of cool but it didn't take

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.110 
kind of kind of cool but it didn't take
me<00:02:33.859> that<00:02:33.920> long<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:34.489> kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:34.969> where

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
me that long you can kind of see where

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.300 
me that long you can kind of see where
they're<00:02:35.269> located<00:02:35.629> inside<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.680> they<00:02:37.280> just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
they're located inside there they just

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.160 
they're located inside there they just
bolt<00:02:37.639> right<00:02:37.819> into<00:02:38.090> there<00:02:38.239> mm-hmm<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.139> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
bolt right into there mm-hmm then I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.349 
bolt right into there mm-hmm then I
found<00:02:39.379> some<00:02:39.620> bolts<00:02:39.859> that<00:02:39.980> threaded<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.519> they

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
found some bolts that threaded in they

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.619 
found some bolts that threaded in they
kind<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.629> looked<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:41.870> this<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.760> they're

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
kind of looked like this and they're

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.659 
kind of looked like this and they're
actually<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.049> little<00:02:45.230> bit<00:02:45.379> longer<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.159> 2x4

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:46.669 
actually a little bit longer so the 2x4

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:47.920 
actually a little bit longer so the 2x4
just<00:02:46.879> sits<00:02:47.090> right<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:47.299> in<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.569> middle<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
just sits right there in the middle and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.729 
just sits right there in the middle and
it<00:02:48.079> can<00:02:48.260> spin<00:02:48.769> while<00:02:49.159> this<00:02:49.340> thing<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.639> tight<00:02:49.909> um

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
it can spin while this thing is tight um

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.140 
it can spin while this thing is tight um
but<00:02:51.739> when<00:02:51.859> I<00:02:51.889> lift<00:02:52.159> it<00:02:52.280> up<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.519> down<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.060> I'll

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
but when I lift it up and down and I'll

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.420 
but when I lift it up and down and I'll
show<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.449> that<00:02:53.719> function<00:02:54.260> next<00:02:54.530> what<00:02:55.280> got<00:02:55.400> I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
show you that function next what got I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.149 
show you that function next what got I
gotta<00:02:55.909> figure<00:02:56.419> out<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.719> way<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.079> like<00:02:57.739> rig<00:02:58.010> this

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
gotta figure out a way to like rig this

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.770 
gotta figure out a way to like rig this
thing<00:02:58.219> up<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.669> where<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.180> hold<00:02:59.329> it<00:02:59.540> say

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
thing up to where I can just hold it say

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.929 
thing up to where I can just hold it say
if<00:02:59.870> I'm<00:02:59.959> driving<00:03:00.349> a<00:03:00.439> long<00:03:00.620> way<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.760> is

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
if I'm driving a long way but this is

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.369 
if I'm driving a long way but this is
just<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.329> made<00:03:02.510> this<00:03:03.459> piece<00:03:04.459> here<00:03:04.699> is<00:03:04.849> 45<00:03:05.629> and<00:03:05.959> 45

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
just I made this piece here is 45 and 45

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.199 
just I made this piece here is 45 and 45
um<00:03:07.040> kind<00:03:07.939> of<00:03:08.030> hard<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.109> by<00:03:09.230> myself<00:03:10.209> but

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
um kind of hard to do it by myself but

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.080 
um kind of hard to do it by myself but
what<00:03:11.689> you<00:03:11.780> do<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.159> what<00:03:13.159> you<00:03:13.280> will<00:03:13.489> do<00:03:13.699> is<00:03:13.760> after

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
what you do is what you will do is after

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.800 
what you do is what you will do is after
it's<00:03:14.329> done<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.760> pull<00:03:17.030> back<00:03:17.060> like<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.750> and

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
it's done just pull back like that and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.199 
it's done just pull back like that and
it<00:03:18.079> lifts<00:03:18.379> it<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.560> off<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.769> ground<00:03:19.099> so<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:20.090> can

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
it lifts it up off the ground so you can

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.030 
it lifts it up off the ground so you can
move<00:03:20.359> it<00:03:20.509> and<00:03:21.139> I<00:03:21.259> got<00:03:21.409> paint<00:03:21.650> all<00:03:21.799> over<00:03:21.829> my

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
move it and I got paint all over my

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.509 
move it and I got paint all over my
thumb<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.699> oh<00:03:22.879> well<00:03:23.419> um<00:03:24.069> that's<00:03:25.069> basically

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
thumb but oh well um that's basically

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.119 
thumb but oh well um that's basically
how<00:03:25.729> it's<00:03:25.909> gonna<00:03:26.299> be<00:03:26.389> done<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:27.680> pretty<00:03:27.859> cool

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
how it's gonna be done it's pretty cool

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.039 
how it's gonna be done it's pretty cool
I<00:03:28.189> like<00:03:28.400> how<00:03:28.819> I<00:03:28.849> did<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.239> um<00:03:29.509> and<00:03:31.720> she's<00:03:32.720> real

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
I like how I did it um and she's real

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.080 
I like how I did it um and she's real
quick<00:03:33.439> and<00:03:33.709> easy<00:03:33.859> this<00:03:34.189> is<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.729> took<00:03:34.939> me

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
quick and easy this is this took me

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.140 
quick and easy this is this took me
probably<00:03:35.239> an<00:03:35.540> hour<00:03:35.720> at<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> max<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:38.120> I

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
probably an hour at the max to do but I

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
tomorrow I'm probably going to make a

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.259 
tomorrow I'm probably going to make a
video<00:03:44.689> of<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.409> actually<00:03:46.069> operating<00:03:46.729> I'm<00:03:47.090> gonna

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
video of it actually operating I'm gonna

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.460 
video of it actually operating I'm gonna
be<00:03:47.359> testing<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.049> don't<00:03:48.229> even<00:03:48.290> know<00:03:48.439> if

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
be testing it so I don't even know if

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.920 
be testing it so I don't even know if
it'll<00:03:48.650> work<00:03:49.060> but<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.449> know<00:03:50.599> if<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.840> never

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
it'll work but you know if it never

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.259 
it'll work but you know if it never
snowed<00:03:51.379> or<00:03:51.590> anything<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.729> can<00:03:52.849> also<00:03:52.939> see<00:03:53.239> that

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
snowed or anything you can also see that

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.659 
snowed or anything you can also see that
it's<00:03:53.930> really<00:03:54.229> strong<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.129> this<00:03:55.280> thing's<00:03:55.489> not

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
it's really strong so this thing's not

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.899 
it's really strong so this thing's not
gonna<00:03:55.819> really<00:03:56.180> be<00:03:56.419> bowing<00:03:56.829> way<00:03:57.829> or<00:03:58.280> anything

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
gonna really be bowing way or anything

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.369 
gonna really be bowing way or anything
like<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.540> only<00:03:59.569> thing<00:03:59.719> is<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.199> thing

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
like that the only thing is this thing

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.929 
like that the only thing is this thing
scraping<00:04:00.979> across<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.310> ground<00:04:01.489> which<00:04:01.639> could

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
scraping across the ground which could

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.059 
scraping across the ground which could
damage<00:04:02.090> grass<00:04:02.930> which<00:04:03.319> I'm<00:04:03.469> not<00:04:03.620> using<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:03.949> on

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
damage grass which I'm not using it on

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.699 
damage grass which I'm not using it on
anybody<00:04:04.280> else's<00:04:04.669> property<00:04:04.909> but<00:04:05.299> mine's<00:04:05.709> gonna

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
anybody else's property but mine's gonna

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.649 
anybody else's property but mine's gonna
have<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.979> worry<00:04:07.159> about<00:04:07.280> any<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.609> that<00:04:07.669> um<00:04:08.030> but

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
have to worry about any of that um but

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.629 
have to worry about any of that um but
it<00:04:08.780> could<00:04:08.930> also<00:04:09.079> probably<00:04:09.590> push<00:04:09.799> firewood<00:04:10.400> it

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
it could also probably push firewood it

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.360 
it could also probably push firewood it
could<00:04:10.729> probably<00:04:10.939> also<00:04:11.329> push<00:04:11.870> snow<00:04:12.319> if<00:04:12.650> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
could probably also push snow if I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.249 
could probably also push snow if I
wanted<00:04:13.759> to<00:04:13.969> which<00:04:14.209> responds<00:04:14.689> get<00:04:14.900> some<00:04:15.049> snow

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
tomorrow but not enough to even get

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.819 
tomorrow but not enough to even get
close<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.169> sticking<00:04:18.709> but<00:04:19.430> um<00:04:20.590> that's<00:04:21.590> what

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
close to sticking but um that's what

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.010 
close to sticking but um that's what
would<00:04:21.919> happen<00:04:22.130> I'd<00:04:22.340> use<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:22.729> maybe<00:04:23.000> if<00:04:23.240> if<00:04:23.599> it

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
would happen I'd use this maybe if if it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.520 
would happen I'd use this maybe if if it

could come up with a good enough idea
and<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.100> quick<00:05:01.310> enough<00:05:01.550> idea<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.090> do<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.890> we'd

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
and a quick enough idea to do it we'd

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.650 
and a quick enough idea to do it we'd
have<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.130> put<00:05:04.310> two<00:05:04.580> one<00:05:04.850> on<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:05.120> side<00:05:05.360> one<00:05:05.510> on

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
have to put two one on that side one on

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.180 
have to put two one on that side one on
that<00:05:05.780> side<00:05:05.840> which<00:05:06.350> we<00:05:06.500> did<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.710> run<00:05:06.919> them<00:05:07.040> way

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
that side which we did to run them way

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.150 
that side which we did to run them way
out<00:05:07.220> so<00:05:08.020> way<00:05:09.020> out<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:09.530> that<00:05:09.560> these<00:05:09.800> tires

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
out so way out so that these tires

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.110 
out so way out so that these tires
couldn't<00:05:10.610> turn<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.070> can<00:05:13.220> see<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
couldn't turn but you can see that the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.480 
couldn't turn but you can see that the
tires<00:05:14.450> don't<00:05:14.780> hit<00:05:15.550> there<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:18.250> it's<00:05:19.250> gonna
