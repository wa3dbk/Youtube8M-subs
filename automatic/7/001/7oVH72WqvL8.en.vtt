low for PC this may be disabled but you
should<00:04:14.489> check<00:04:14.699> how<00:04:15.000> black<00:04:15.419> level<00:04:15.989> look<00:04:16.260> if

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
should check how black level look if

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.279 
should check how black level look if
it's<00:04:16.789> more<00:04:17.789> gray<00:04:18.120> than<00:04:18.150> black<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.260> you

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's more gray than black then you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.159 
it's more gray than black then you
should<00:04:19.739> adjust<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.729> like<00:04:21.389> level<00:04:21.780> setting

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
should adjust this like level setting

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.060 
should adjust this like level setting
local<00:04:23.010> dimming<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.930> suggest<00:04:24.930> using<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.470> at<00:04:25.710> low

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
local dimming I suggest using it at low

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.510 
local dimming I suggest using it at low
or<00:04:26.400> medium<00:04:26.580> setting<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.599> should<00:04:27.630> try<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.520> it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
or medium setting you should try it it

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.000 
or medium setting you should try it it
really<00:04:29.760> improves<00:04:30.180> black<00:04:30.510> level<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.289> contrast

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
really improves black level and contrast

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.820 
really improves black level and contrast
so<00:04:32.520> play<00:04:32.880> with<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.180> settings<00:04:33.599> through<00:04:34.349> motion

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
so play with the settings through motion

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.540 
so play with the settings through motion
