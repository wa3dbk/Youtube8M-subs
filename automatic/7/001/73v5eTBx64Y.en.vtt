more woody stem so the key to making
really<00:02:13.380> good<00:02:13.650> compost<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.580> add<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> balanced

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
really good compost is to add a balanced

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.070 
composting bug started and the Browns
will<00:02:25.629> give<00:02:25.780> structure<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.470> body<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:26.980> heap

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
will give structure and body to the heap

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.570 
will give structure and body to the heap
if<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.409> material<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.980> add<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> bin<00:02:30.549> is

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
if the material you add to the bin is

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.850 
if the material you add to the bin is
dry<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.690> will<00:02:31.810> also<00:02:31.959> need<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.379> add<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.620> bit

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
dry then you will also need to add a bit

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610 
dry then you will also need to add a bit
of<00:02:32.890> water<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.269> final<00:02:34.690> ingredient<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.349> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
of water the final ingredient is the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.319 
of water the final ingredient is the
many<00:02:35.830> microorganisms<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.879> will<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.209> the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
many microorganisms that will do the

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.630 
many microorganisms that will do the
composting<00:02:37.959> for<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.950> can't<00:02:39.159> see<00:02:39.400> them

composting for you you can't see them

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.220 
composting for you you can't see them
but<00:02:39.819> there<00:02:40.000> are<00:02:40.090> millions<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:40.870> handful

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
but there are millions in this handful

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.229 
but there are millions in this handful
of<00:02:41.290> compost<00:02:41.860> they<00:02:42.519> moving<00:02:42.909> in<00:02:43.000> their<00:02:43.120> own
