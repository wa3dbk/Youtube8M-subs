00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.350
 that there flag here is renewed I hope 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.930
 that they are super super better than 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 me today and always tomorrow every day and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.470
 I also hope you are having it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.219
 super super cool anywhere 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.630
 of the world where they are going then flag 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.409
 I want to take this video and that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.449
 to give some news and then we are going to 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.720
 start with the first one is that it has 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.839
 updated now I no longer have windows 7 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.489
 but windows 8 as you can see good if 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.679
 I have windows 7 but in a partition in 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.329
 another partition but what I want 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 to arrive is that we are going to start working 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 with windows 8 not the new one or that one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.620
 microsoft that so far so that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.289
 as you can see the metro menu runs 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 quite adequate and my subway menu 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.730
 customized because obviously at 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 pass me windows 8 we will work with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.289
 what is personalization in the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 windows 8 obviously some tips 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.380
 optimization 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.500
 many many things the applications that 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.860
 new that has windows 8 and many 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.080
 things that then basically follows 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.540
 being the same from microsoft follow 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.050
 still being windows, but 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.790
 there are improvements and updates things 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.060
 different and obviously I want to 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.160
 work with them already know always 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.050
 base personalization because then I think 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 What is it that identifies us well? 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.300
 Cr9 channel and there are many others 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.040
 the personalization identifies us many 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.770
 but without leaving behind the da 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.110
 the optimization work with 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 software with many softwares that has 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.800
 windows 8 the truth super pro the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.100
 applications of the windows store 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.960
 store and then everything there are many things 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.710
 what to see and then I just wanted to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 were aware of this 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 restaurant aware of this because 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.190
 Well now windows 7 we will follow 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.820
 working but not as soon 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.430
 no longer so regular no longer so daily by 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.190
 so to say it but let's get into 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.619
 filled a little windows 8 there as they 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.300
 I tell the truth is the truth is super 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.050
 quick as you can see things there 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.739
 they open up, that is, up to the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.350
 do not even criticize me towards windows 8 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.819
 It is good this has not let me down by the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.820
 moment with time I've taken it 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.239
 using that they are like since when it came out 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.560
 in October they were not using from 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.260
 November the end of November and then 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 mop tillage has not disappointed me 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.600
 no blue screenshot no crater 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.400
 none of those things that then 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.980
 basically the operating systems 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.220
 new brings not here as you can see here 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.260
 yes yes gentlemen are the 644 of Friday 8 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.319
 February for the one that I asked 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 have the curiosity yes 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.910
 see here in metro menu, as you would see 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.280
 It is customized 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 with the personalized wallpaper 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.900
 with the background because the bottom where there 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.790
 is another with the background and with these or 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.190
 tiles that I think they say 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.250
 stems because personalized because 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.960
 Obviously, we have to add coconut to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.360
 this and we have to get into this 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.430
 and these are the first steps that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.350
 given with windows 8 x installed my pc 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.260
 because he had a laptop already with windows 8 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.420
 but I prefer to have it here because it's very 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.370
 super very much more comfortable not also 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.040
 discarded the laptop but I like it more 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.380
 here not and then here as you can see the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.020
 Metro menu is up to it but the 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.210
 already modified sizes that I have taken 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.020
 my time to modify the social 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.540
 is putting time that is a truth and 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.400
 well here the truth is that the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.360
 internet opens super super fast as 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.350
 can see here 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 let's wait 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.610
 and then it is for your use and now here 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.060
 you simply type 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.350
 for example to some youtube 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.040
 and then here youtube mexico 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 we open it and then the truth is that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.379
 is super Peruvian and here you can 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.219
 start opening your videos or things 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:12.219
 common but that the truth has improved 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.959
 in windows 8 for example here we have 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.310
 a browser from our metro menu 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.009
 aside we have the google chrome 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.739
 many things that we will come seeing already 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.110
 later on but basically that's what 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.080
 I wanted to mention to you that now it's going to be 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.220
 windows 8 in its entirety good in its 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.289
 mostly not and windows 7 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.970
 a little less obviously not 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.160
 I discard a digit because then the themes 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.780
 from there I love it is a system 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.570
 operative that I loved after 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.070
 x but because sight has been a garbage and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.740
 as I tell all those who 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.889
 want to upgrade to windows 8 because the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.889
 truth is that from 1 to 10 I put a 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.590
 98.5 maybe because then I tell them what 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.540
 the time that I have worked it the truth 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.550
 I was disappointed you are very, very, very 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.590
 Quick 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.460
 just as good because it is that windows 7 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.840
 I also remembered I was running fast but 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.520
 if I had the opportunity if it were 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.170
 you if I had the opportunity to 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.570
 change my windows 8 for surely what 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.670
 would do because if they come super new 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.760
 new things the truth is that the menu 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.650
 metro is quite striking 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.580
 it is not so routine to work with 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.550
 windows but that 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.610
 is something already different I will not know the 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.770
 things with time tires or bores 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.469
 then windows 8 that come to refresh 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.270
 is a refresh or for your computer already and 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.720
 apart so format your disk that sure 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.640
 they have it super super congested no 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.650
 Well nothing brothers are going to get us 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.200
 filled with your personalization the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.020
 optimization applications and thousands of 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.230
 things and thousands of things so if they have 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.300
 doubt and have advice and have tips or 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.600
 if they have any questions for me that 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.920
 they want me to make a video just 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.800
 send it and it 's in the comments it's 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.570
 the system tray send an inbox 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.980
 it's easy and simple no gentlemen to start 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.950
 from the next video I'm going to start 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.380
 share and do not believe that with this law 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.150
 what I did, I'm going to forget about things 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.240
 that students of the icons of the 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:19.100
 wallpapers and things have been clear there 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.040
 there are 22 people who asked me to 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.020
 go up 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.300
 is that I can not say everything but the 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.640
 most of my wallpapers and well clear 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.140
 your people believe me I tell you from 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.390
 right now no no I'm not going to rule them out 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.040
 obviously yes yes I have them in mind and 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.570
 I will upload the wallpapers too and 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.120
 many applications that there are but 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.860
 windows 8 customization so no 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.310
 be afraid this channel is not going to 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.680
 come back as well as that 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.480
 pure tutorial and tutorial also there goes 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.150
 to have customization style never 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.060
 is lost if the flag is not improved and 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.580
 because the wallpapers'm going to raise no 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.180
 I know soon let's wait because there's a lot 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.540
 people that I am asking for the 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.640
 sorry and the net this saga wallpaper 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.640
 has a lot for a lot that does not 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.320
 upload and you'll see they're super close 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.150
 I think they had them here 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.190
 this is a preview of the 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.920
 good wallpapers this is not only 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.930
 a folder as you can see quite a few 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.680
 blows because some of these because 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.860
 but from here, I think 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.530
 Not because I have not seen them, no bands 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.450
 and then wait for the pac and nothing with this 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.870
 I think that everything is more than clarified 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.960
 now it's windows 8 and not windows 7 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.550
 and remember that the quintet evolution of 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.920
 steam of the world 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.400
 I went I am and I will be cr9 and see you in the 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.400
 next
