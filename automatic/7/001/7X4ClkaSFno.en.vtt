from<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> takeoff<00:02:34.840> when<00:02:35.020> i<00:02:35.080> square<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
from the takeoff when i square up the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.650 
from the takeoff when i square up the
jet<00:02:36.100> right<00:02:36.340> into<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> vertical<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.240> start

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
jet right into the vertical and start

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.550 
jet right into the vertical and start
putting<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.930> through<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.140> sequence<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
putting it through a sequence of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.140 
putting it through a sequence of
maneuvers<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> lot<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.370> other<00:02:39.490> airplanes

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
maneuvers that a lot of other airplanes

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.690 
maneuvers that a lot of other airplanes
can't<00:02:40.420> execute<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.370> maneuver

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
can't execute actually the the maneuver

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700 
can't execute actually the the maneuver
sequence<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.180> I'm<00:02:43.330> executing<00:02:43.690> while<00:02:44.620> I'm

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
sequence that I'm executing while I'm

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.290 
sequence that I'm executing while I'm
flying<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> display<00:02:45.460> are<00:02:45.700> actually<00:02:46.090> right<00:02:46.270> in

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
flying the display are actually right in

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.580 
flying the display are actually right in
the<00:02:46.450> part<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> envelope<00:02:47.050> for<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the part of the envelope for the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.560 
the part of the envelope for the
aircraft<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.400> performing<00:02:49.210> those<00:02:49.270> maneuvers

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
aircraft so performing those maneuvers

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.720 
aircraft so performing those maneuvers
is<00:02:50.080> actually<00:02:50.470> relatively<00:02:51.070> simple<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.700> terms

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
is actually relatively simple in terms

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.370 
is actually relatively simple in terms
of<00:02:52.000> my<00:02:52.060> inputs<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.050> flight

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
of my inputs to the to the flight

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.870 
of my inputs to the to the flight
controls<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.100> see<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.460> that's<00:02:54.580> one<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.820> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
controls and see and that's one of the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.580 
controls and see and that's one of the
things<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.120> separates<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> f-22<00:02:56.290> from<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
things that separates the f-22 from a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.020 
things that separates the f-22 from a
lot<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> other<00:02:57.010> jet<00:02:57.370> demonstrations<00:02:57.880> is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
lot of the other jet demonstrations is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.640 
lot of the other jet demonstrations is
these<00:02:58.210> are<00:02:58.240> combat<00:02:58.750> coated<00:02:59.080> aircraft<00:02:59.440> there

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
these are combat coated aircraft there

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.260

where it's designed to fly I like the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.320 
where it's designed to fly I like the
entire<00:03:11.920> demonstration<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.850> thrill<00:03:13.120> for

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
me every time I get to do and every time

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.570 
me every time I get to do and every time
I<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:14.770> interact<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> crowd<00:03:15.460> and

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
I get to interact with the crowd and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.790 
I get to interact with the crowd and
showcase<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.900> capability<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.500> we<00:03:17.560> have

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
showcase the capability that we have

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.770 
showcase the capability that we have
with<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.459> fifth<00:03:18.730> generation<00:03:19.030> fighter<00:03:19.180> but

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
with this fifth generation fighter but

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.300 
with this fifth generation fighter but
probably<00:03:20.080> my<00:03:20.200> favorite<00:03:20.530> maneuvers<00:03:20.920> are<00:03:21.130> the

the aircraft in front of the public

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.890 
the aircraft in front of the public
which<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:08.830> we<00:04:09.010> are<00:04:09.850> core<00:04:10.150> objective<00:04:10.630> and

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.710 
taking the aircraft back to the people
which<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.709> whole<00:04:17.829> point<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.310> project

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
which is the whole point of the project

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.690 
which is the whole point of the project
and<00:04:19.720> getting<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:20.829> many<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.100> them<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.370> close<00:04:21.579> to

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and getting so many of them so close to

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.340 
and getting so many of them so close to
the<00:04:21.790> aircraft<00:04:22.120> pays<00:04:22.390> dividend<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.170> we're

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
the aircraft pays dividend so we're

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.140 
the aircraft pays dividend so we're
having<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.650> great<00:04:23.860> show<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.250> year<00:04:24.430> we're

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
