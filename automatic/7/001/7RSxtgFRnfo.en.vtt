00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
start today as well just just quite in

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.850 
start today as well just just quite in
the<00:01:46.310> beginning<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.939> first<00:01:47.149> 1i<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.500> felt

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
the beginning of the first 1i I felt

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.410 
the beginning of the first 1i I felt
that<00:01:49.009> something<00:01:49.219> is<00:01:49.460> ending<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.820> bit<00:01:50.149> strange

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
that something is ending a bit strange

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.819 
that something is ending a bit strange
and<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.850> think<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.360> eight<00:01:54.319> ten<00:01:54.590> guys

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
and and then I think just eight ten guys

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.300 
and and then I think just eight ten guys
before<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.490> end<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.880> state's<00:01:56.119> just

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
before the end of the state's just

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.969 
before the end of the state's just
completely<00:01:58.310> got<00:01:58.549> loose<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.119> then<00:01:59.600> when<00:02:00.439> we<00:02:00.470> go

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
completely got loose and then when we go

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.090 
completely got loose and then when we go
to<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.220> end<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.549> states<00:02:01.789> we<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:03.100> checked

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
to the end of the states we just checked

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.330 
to the end of the states we just checked
off<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.429> god<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.819> then<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.659> saw<00:02:05.840> that
