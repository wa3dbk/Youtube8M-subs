if<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.040> were<00:02:40.190> thinking<00:02:40.580> about<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.700> is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
if you were thinking about it this is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850 
if you were thinking about it this is
also<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.180> thicker<00:02:44.570> wand<00:02:44.930> than<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.320> lot<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.680> them

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
also a thicker wand than a lot of them

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.699 
also a thicker wand than a lot of them
so<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.700> harder<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.360> crack<00:02:47.630> or<00:02:48.019> break<00:02:48.050> but<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
so it is harder to crack or break but it

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.310 
so it is harder to crack or break but it
still<00:02:49.010> will<00:02:49.250> because<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.209> collectible<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
still will because it is collectible and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.030 
still will because it is collectible and
is<00:02:51.440> fragile<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.280> made<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.640> resin<00:02:53.860> thank<00:02:54.860> you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
