00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.000 

the<00:03:54.310> last<00:03:54.580> one<00:03:54.850> in<00:03:55.000> here<00:03:58.350> now<00:03:59.350> this<00:03:59.710> is<00:03:59.890> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
the last one in here now this is the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.500 
the last one in here now this is the
part<00:04:00.250> that's<00:04:00.310> going<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.700> take<00:04:00.850> some<00:04:00.880> patience

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
part that's going to take some patience

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.660 
part that's going to take some patience
I<00:04:02.580> found<00:04:03.580> if<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.630> can<00:04:04.840> get<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.780> two<00:04:08.670> bolts

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
I found if you can get the two bolts

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.150 
I found if you can get the two bolts
that<00:04:09.730> were<00:04:10.030> sitting<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:11.500> we're<00:04:11.650> building<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
that were sitting that we're building on

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.070 
that were sitting that we're building on
the<00:04:12.310> original<00:04:12.730> hitch<00:04:13.710> started<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.720> know<00:04:16.810> a

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
the original hitch started you know a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.490 
the original hitch started you know a
few<00:04:17.560> threads<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.870> all<00:04:20.020> it's<00:04:20.200> going<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.410> take

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
few threads then all it's going to take

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.140 
few threads then all it's going to take
is<00:04:20.920> that<00:04:22.860> swivel<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:25.240> long<00:04:25.420> extension

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
is that swivel and a long extension

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.870 
is that swivel and a long extension
quarter<00:04:28.150> inch<00:04:31.800> extension<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.220> swivel<00:04:33.790> is

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
quarter inch extension and swivel is

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.910 
quarter inch extension and swivel is
probably<00:04:34.150> going<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.330> be<00:04:34.420> your<00:04:34.570> best<00:04:34.810> bet<00:04:35.110> just

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
probably going to be your best bet just

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.700 
probably going to be your best bet just
because<00:04:36.220> they're<00:04:36.430> smaller<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.860> size<00:04:40.710> won't

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
because they're smaller and size won't

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:51.300 
because they're smaller and size won't
take<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:47.830> whole<00:04:48.760> lot<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.000> do<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:50.160> there's<00:04:51.160> if

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
take a whole lot to do that there's if

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.780 
take a whole lot to do that there's if
you've<00:04:51.550> got<00:04:51.760> somebody<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:53.010> got<00:04:54.010> small<00:04:54.580> and

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
you've got somebody that's got small and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.190 
you've got somebody that's got small and
agile<00:04:54.940> fingers<00:04:56.040> won't<00:04:57.040> be<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.430> good<00:04:57.700> job<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.450> ask

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
agile fingers won't be a good job to ask

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:10.370 
agile fingers won't be a good job to ask
a<00:04:59.410> favour<00:04:59.680> on<00:04:59.830> right<00:05:00.220> here

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
out here tighten up all four of these

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.120 
out here tighten up all four of these
bolts<00:05:18.759> out<00:05:18.880> here<00:05:19.120> tighten<00:05:19.600> them<00:05:19.810> up<00:05:19.949> to<00:05:20.949> where

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
bolts out here tighten them up to where

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.439 
bolts out here tighten them up to where
it's<00:05:21.449> squished<00:05:22.449> good<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.350> tight<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:25.150> plate

it's squished good and tight the plate

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.689 
it's squished good and tight the plate
might<00:05:25.720> bend<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.139> little<00:05:26.259> bit<00:05:26.460> basically<00:05:27.460> just

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
might bend a little bit basically just

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.090 
might bend a little bit basically just
taking<00:05:27.910> up<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> gap<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:29.169> way<00:05:29.289> squeezing

taking up the gap that way squeezing

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.640 
taking up the gap that way squeezing
these<00:05:30.250> pipes<00:05:30.699> you<00:05:31.419> know<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.720> frames<00:05:32.229> really

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
these pipes you know the frames really

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.640 
these pipes you know the frames really
good<00:05:32.880> isn't<00:05:33.880> moving<00:05:34.030> once<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:35.139> tighten<00:05:35.380> them

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
good isn't moving once you tighten them

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
the back u-bolts and that will finish up

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.540 
the back u-bolts and that will finish up
yeah<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.289> guess<00:05:50.530> we<00:05:50.650> got<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.860> put<00:05:51.070> this<00:05:51.220> plate
