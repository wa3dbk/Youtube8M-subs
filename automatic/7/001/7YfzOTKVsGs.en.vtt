hey<00:00:05.090> guys<00:00:05.270> one<00:00:05.990> more<00:00:06.110> quick<00:00:06.920> video<00:00:07.220> with<00:00:07.430> the

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
hey guys one more quick video with the

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.390 
hey guys one more quick video with the
Leica<00:00:07.730> m9<00:00:08.469> but<00:00:09.469> I<00:00:09.500> just<00:00:09.770> run<00:00:10.040> through<00:00:10.219> the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
Leica m9 but I just run through the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.740 
Leica m9 but I just run through the
controls<00:00:10.820> quickly<00:00:12.400> it's<00:00:13.400> a<00:00:13.520> whole<00:00:14.240> lot<00:00:14.510> more

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
controls quickly it's a whole lot more

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.930 
controls quickly it's a whole lot more
basic<00:00:15.230> than<00:00:15.260> an<00:00:15.469> SLR<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.160> this<00:00:16.309> shouldn't<00:00:16.490> take

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
basic than an SLR so this shouldn't take

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.730 
basic than an SLR so this shouldn't take
too<00:00:16.970> long

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
too long

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.710 
too long
basically<00:00:18.939> on<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.029> top<00:00:20.179> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.359> camera<00:00:20.539> here

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
basically on the top of the camera here

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.550 
basically on the top of the camera here
manual<00:00:23.720> aperture<00:00:23.900> ring<00:00:25.480> focus<00:00:26.480> ring<00:00:26.750> is<00:00:27.380> there

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
manual aperture ring focus ring is there

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.400 
manual aperture ring focus ring is there
on<00:00:27.650> all<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:27.919> lenses<00:00:28.330> hyper<00:00:29.330> focal<00:00:29.810> scale<00:00:30.050> here

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
on all the lenses hyper focal scale here

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.020 
on all the lenses hyper focal scale here
to<00:00:31.390> help<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.480> focus<00:00:32.720> nice<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.170> quickly<00:00:33.350> and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
to help you focus nice and quickly and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.480 
to help you focus nice and quickly and
then<00:00:35.290> on<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.530> top<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.860> camera<00:00:37.010> itself<00:00:37.340> you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
then on the top of the camera itself you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.460 
then on the top of the camera itself you
got<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.610> shutter<00:00:37.880> button<00:00:38.860> off<00:00:40.210> position<00:00:41.470> this

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
got a shutter button off position this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.780 
got a shutter button off position this
is<00:00:42.650> continuous<00:00:43.220> shooting<00:00:43.400> mode<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:46.640> can

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
is continuous shooting mode so you can

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.900 
is continuous shooting mode so you can
hear<00:00:46.970> it's<00:00:47.390> not<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.600> speediest<00:00:47.960> camera<00:00:48.380> but

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
hear it's not the speediest camera but

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.280 
hear it's not the speediest camera but
there<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:50.000> go<00:00:50.060> that's<00:00:50.150> that's<00:00:50.690> continuous

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
there you go that's that's continuous

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.270 
there you go that's that's continuous
and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:51.880> single<00:00:52.880> shot<00:00:53.090> mode<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:57.100> then<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
and then single shot mode and then the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.840 
and then single shot mode and then the
final<00:00:58.580> position<00:00:58.850> there<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.030> timer<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.850> then

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
final position there is timer so then

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.780 
final position there is timer so then
you<00:01:01.940> have<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.240> dial<00:01:02.510> here<00:01:03.159> this<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.369> pretty

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you have this dial here this is pretty

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.990 
you have this dial here this is pretty
simple<00:01:05.059> as<00:01:05.269> well<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.659> which<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.710> for<00:01:07.370> automatic

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
simple as well a which is for automatic

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.550 
simple as well a which is for automatic
and<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.480> an<00:01:08.660> aperture<00:01:08.960> priority<00:01:09.260> mode

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
and that is an aperture priority mode

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.860 
and that is an aperture priority mode
obviously<00:01:09.830> II<00:01:10.240> set<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.330> aperture<00:01:11.480> with<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
obviously II set the aperture with the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.320 
obviously II set the aperture with the
ring<00:01:12.050> there<00:01:12.260> then<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:13.190> have<00:01:13.370> all<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.030> various

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
ring there then you have all the various

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.120 
ring there then you have all the various
shutter<00:01:14.600> speeds<00:01:14.900> for<00:01:15.260> thousandth<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.010> a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
shutter speeds for thousandth of a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.280 
shutter speeds for thousandth of a
second<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.880> fastest<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:20.780> turns<00:01:21.050> all<00:01:21.200> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
second is the fastest that turns all the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.040 
second is the fastest that turns all the
way<00:01:21.380> down<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.430> have<00:01:22.610> one<00:01:23.600> second

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
way down and then you have one second

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.399 
way down and then you have one second
two<00:01:24.320> seconds<00:01:24.770> four<00:01:25.159> seconds<00:01:25.640> eight<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.480> then

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
two seconds four seconds eight and then

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.610 
two seconds four seconds eight and then
bulb<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.110> bulb<00:01:30.350> setting

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
bulb so when you have it on bulb setting

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.240 
bulb so when you have it on bulb setting
obviously<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.880> hold<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.360> Oh<00:01:33.040> got<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.130> on

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
obviously you hold it in Oh got it on

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.540 
obviously you hold it in Oh got it on
time<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.520> ever<00:01:34.990> if<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.190> on<00:01:37.280> bulb

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
time and ever if you have it on bulb

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.500 
time and ever if you have it on bulb
then<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.970> hold<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.490> it'll<00:01:40.490> take<00:01:40.760> as

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
then you hold it in and it'll take as

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.330 
then you hold it in and it'll take as
long<00:01:41.570> as<00:01:41.930> exposures<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:42.770> want<00:01:42.979> if<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.190> doing

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
long as exposures you want if you doing

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.539 
long as exposures you want if you doing
some<00:01:43.520> nighttime<00:01:43.700> shots<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.220> back<00:01:46.370> of<00:01:46.490> the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
some nighttime shots on the back of the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.300 
some nighttime shots on the back of the
camera<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:48.400> for<00:01:49.400> position<00:01:49.850> job<00:01:50.950> dial<00:01:51.950> I

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
camera then for position job dial I

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.039 
camera then for position job dial I
guess<00:01:54.940> there<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.180> dedicated<00:01:56.510> button<00:01:57.020> for

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
guess there is a dedicated button for

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.340 
guess there is a dedicated button for
ISO<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.850> hold<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.390> button<00:01:59.630> down<00:01:59.750> for<00:01:59.869> ISO

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
ISO so you hold that button down for ISO

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.770 
ISO so you hold that button down for ISO
and<00:02:00.560> then<00:02:00.680> select<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.610> ISO<00:02:01.970> using<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.510> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and then select the ISO using the the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.960 
and then select the ISO using the the
jog<00:02:02.990> dial<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.700> taking<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.760> picture

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
jog dial here if you taking a picture

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.349
