00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 remember that the front camera iphone 5 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.350
 already records at 720p while it is not 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.869
 they record h the rear camera is coming 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 recording the iphone 5 in what is 1080p 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.099
 the iphone 4s also in 1080p but we 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.200
 good camera or it's not good we're going to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 megapixels on the back just like 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 camera for you to give your own 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 opinion like this whole week 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 we are going to be doing videos of versus 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.899

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.750
 versus the iphone 4s and we're also going to 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 bring kisses against the galaxy s3 or the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 note and tell us there in the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.580
 description or in the comments 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.220
 you want videos of versus in 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.200
 what aspect and against what 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 good phone today let's see from 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:47.379
 cameras then how about we start 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:47.379
 [Music] 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:03:33.510
 yes 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:03:36.030
 [Music] 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.150
 now let's move on to the verses of the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.549
 front camera this prinstein camera in 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.650
 as to video and then we are going to 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.120
 see what the photos are and then the photo 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.829
 will not start to see what the video is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.480
 let's try what the new ones are 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.250
 microphones and let's make a 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
 difference as to the microphone the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.349
 iphone 4s the iphone 5 microphone and the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.750
 professional microphone that in this 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.170
 moment we are using to see how they are doing 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.170
 it looks like you 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:24.280
 [Music] 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.280
 Hello 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.809
 now there are 5 and now we are listening 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.789
 the sound of what a microphone is 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:42.490
 professional if you already would be 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.559
 looking at what is your screen we are 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.969
 seeing that at this moment we are 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.699
 looking at the screen of what is the 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.319
 iphone 5 del ayunta 13 good iphone 5 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.009
 I think they handle the 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.620
 colors does not saturate it so much one does not 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.270
 it has them as bad as the iphone 4s here 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.099
 the previous one that I am seeing seemed to me 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.589
 which have better quality colors what 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.020
 that is the iphone 5 does not have them so 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.060
 dark and sometimes it does not make them so 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.099
 bright shows a picture just like 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.529
 is and well then if you take advantage of what 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.539
 which is the camera that now records in 720 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.880
 p and at this moment we have it 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.010
 in this way by trade 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.050
 the way as if we were 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.060
 making feist on call via text 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.700
 we are doing there at this moment with 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.400
 the sound of iphone 5 so that you 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.400
 try to see what the sound is now 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 and 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.280
 in such a good general well it was true and 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.450
 sense 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.450
 in terms of food 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.080
 they say 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560
 and 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.350
 for direct 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.300
 Now we are examining the iphone 5 for 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.130
 that you believe it and now we are 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 listening to the professional microphone 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.150
 lussier and for you to be there 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.040
 proving they are listening to 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.080
 you decide that you have to buy it 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.060
 I recommend it is a lot the iphone 5 and 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.790
 well that was all for the video of the 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.040
 front camera thank you very much for this 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.800
 front camera video let's move on to 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.720
 what is the other chamber that was all ok 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.340
 for this video today we take into account what 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.710
 which is the verse of these two things 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.990
 very recognized cameras in what is the 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.090
 market the truth I prefer one of the 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.730
 iphone 5 it shows that they have improved it 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.710
 and especially the front camera that if you 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.530
 they had to make many arrangements since 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.570
 it was not as good as the one that is now 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.850
 the iphone 5 seems very good to me 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.560
 quality of this iphone and I think it's a 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.140
 good look where you have to 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.270
 improve when updating the 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.070
 design of a telephone that was all 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.560
