00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello then here today we're going to make a salmon in fine 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.389
 we start with the back 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.389
 a dudon incision 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 in the same sense what we do is not necessarily lorca 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.659
 always to remember them 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.140
 but never blows like that because otherwise we took things in hand 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 and after that comes alone 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 - to degrease a little 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 gold this technique and thought the fish 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.000
 we have a nice filet of salmon 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.520
 it's the cpi if it's the part to make the carpaccio so the same 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.810
 very fine 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.690
 and if it's the party to advance for sushi 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.790
 once salmon runs with her 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 a little broccoli or on the leeks secretary 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.290
 let's start on the other side so that's a little bit more complicated 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 we will take a small knife 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.930
 always for that 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.930
 the first time 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.530
 a small slit 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.049
 but here we do not try this fish because a year ago some people 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.420
 who want to keep 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300
 who want to keep the scales to make 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.830
 the rfid or adoption 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.720
 the pitfalls will protect the fish 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 he will not become his critics 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 so here we have there lakers we will add 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.010
 we will take back our son m 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.009
 I am 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.419
 after 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.419
 I'm traveling well 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 now that the people 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.779
 so now we have opened a small salmon pavement or that we see 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:40.679
 orders 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.269
 but then deposited 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.269
 george mitchell beneteau stranger arras that saturate 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.369
 if it's part of the floating coast we saw earlier but 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 understandable but also missiles towards pulled by science 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.359
 clint eastwood for her that will start immediately prompted the ire 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.339
 another sign 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.039
 and for that are a little bit hidden to are always tempted in the expensive 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.039
 that's why we need to know our morphology 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.569
 Why 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.059
 now stay in our turn 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.059
 etc merged for the patriotic hero 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.909
 why otherwise it will soon be a market that is under pressure from the 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:40.729
 employment 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.729
 ckb on prices 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.409
 g 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.769
 Yes
