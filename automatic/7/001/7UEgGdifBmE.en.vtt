00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
to me as a combination of regular

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.710 
to me as a combination of regular
commander<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.320> legacy<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.510> little

card<00:06:20.090> before<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.570> actually<00:06:21.940> at<00:06:22.940> first<00:06:23.180> see<00:06:23.660> one

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
card before I actually at first see one

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.290 
card before I actually at first see one
thing<00:06:24.080> I<00:06:24.170> do<00:06:24.230> like<00:06:24.470> about<00:06:24.530> tiny<00:06:24.950> leaders<00:06:25.310> is<00:06:25.550> it

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
thing I do like about tiny leaders is it

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.820 
thing I do like about tiny leaders is it
really<00:06:28.630> emphasizes<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.930> power<00:06:30.170> level<00:06:30.650> of

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
really emphasizes the power level of

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.990 
really emphasizes the power level of
cards<00:06:31.430> that<00:06:31.930> cost<00:06:32.930> more<00:06:33.470> than<00:06:33.740> three<00:06:34.010> like

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
cards that cost more than three like

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.910 
cards that cost more than three like
obviously<00:06:35.390> the<00:06:35.540> smuggler<00:06:35.930> cost<00:06:36.140> one<00:06:36.440> but<00:06:36.830> his

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
obviously the smuggler cost one but his

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.030 
obviously the smuggler cost one but his
ability<00:06:37.310> is<00:06:37.550> valued<00:06:38.510> at<00:06:38.660> four<00:06:38.960> yes<00:06:39.410> based<00:06:39.890> on

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
ability is valued at four yes based on

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.980 
ability is valued at four yes based on
the<00:06:40.130> card<00:06:40.370> so<00:06:40.790> cards<00:06:41.030> that<00:06:41.150> could<00:06:41.270> kind<00:06:41.420> of<00:06:41.600> go

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
the card so cards that could kind of go

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.640 
the card so cards that could kind of go
above<00:06:42.290> what<00:06:42.620> it<00:06:42.710> says<00:06:42.860> on<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.010> card<00:06:44.470> are<00:06:45.470> gonna

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
above what it says on the card are gonna

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.960 
above what it says on the card are gonna
be<00:06:45.830> even<00:06:46.100> better<00:06:46.220> than<00:06:46.490> they<00:06:46.580> normally<00:06:46.760> would

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
be even better than they normally would

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.790 
be even better than they normally would
because<00:06:47.420> they're<00:06:47.690> providing<00:06:47.840> much<00:06:48.440> larger

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
because they're providing much larger

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.250 
because they're providing much larger
effects<00:06:49.100> and<00:06:49.340> then<00:06:49.490> probably<00:06:50.419> I<00:06:50.630> think<00:06:50.720> the

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
effects and then probably I think the

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.659 
effects and then probably I think the
best<00:06:51.500> creature<00:06:51.800> of<00:06:51.979> talent<00:06:52.250> leaders<00:06:52.460> true

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
best creature of talent leaders true

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.770 
best creature of talent leaders true
