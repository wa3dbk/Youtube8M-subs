00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
me that I don't know why do they work on

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.340 
me that I don't know why do they work on
planted<00:02:20.300> tanks<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.840> these<00:02:20.930> lights<00:02:21.200> on

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
planted tanks I have these lights on

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260 
planted tanks I have these lights on
every<00:02:21.740> single<00:02:22.070> one<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.190> my<00:02:22.310> tanks<00:02:22.820> now<00:02:23.000> i'm

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
every single one of my tanks now i'm

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.600 
every single one of my tanks now i'm
pretty<00:02:23.510> sure<00:02:23.750> if<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:25.040> didn't<00:02:25.310> work<00:02:25.459> on

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
pretty sure if they didn't work on

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.310 
pretty sure if they didn't work on
planted<00:02:26.090> tanks<00:02:26.420> i<00:02:26.510> probably<00:02:26.750> wouldn't<00:02:27.200> have

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
planted tanks i probably wouldn't have

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.060 
planted tanks i probably wouldn't have
put<00:02:27.530> them<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.860> all<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.370> my<00:02:28.610> tanks<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:30.140> yes<00:02:30.650> they

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
put them on all of my tanks so yes they

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.770 
put them on all of my tanks so yes they
work<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.430> planted<00:02:31.910> tanks<00:02:32.270> they<00:02:32.570> work<00:02:32.750> just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
work on planted tanks they work just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.480 
work on planted tanks they work just
like<00:02:33.140> any<00:02:33.380> other<00:02:33.470> light<00:02:33.920> that's<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
like any other light that's in the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.800 
like any other light that's in the
correct<00:02:34.790> spectrum<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.570> will<00:02:36.230> grow<00:02:36.709> plants

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
correct spectrum that will grow plants

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.080 
correct spectrum that will grow plants
huzzah<00:02:41.410> what<00:02:42.410> does<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> other<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:43.370> don't<00:02:44.030> know

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
huzzah what does the other I don't know

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.490 
huzzah what does the other I don't know
I've<00:02:44.209> been<00:02:44.360> getting<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.930> many<00:02:45.050> questions

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I've been getting so many questions

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.110 
I've been getting so many questions
about<00:02:45.709> these<00:02:45.830> lights<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.640> don't<00:02:46.910> make

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
about these lights like I don't make

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.720 
about these lights like I don't make
them<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.600> bought<00:02:48.500> them<00:02:48.560> off<00:02:48.830> amazon<00:02:49.310> I've<00:02:49.489> made

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
them I bought them off amazon I've made

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.490 
them I bought them off amazon I've made
a<00:02:49.760> lot<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> videos<00:02:50.330> about<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.930> don't<00:02:51.380> make

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
a lot of videos about it I don't make

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.710 
a lot of videos about it I don't make
them<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.580> light<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
them I just it's a light that is in the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.920 
them I just it's a light that is in the
correct<00:02:53.900> spectrum<00:02:54.709> they<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.220> happen<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.580> be

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
correct spectrum they just happen to be

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.260 
correct spectrum they just happen to be
led<00:02:57.280> instead<00:02:58.280> of<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:01.580> know<00:03:01.610> fluorescent

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
just by the correct spectrum you can

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.690 
just by the correct spectrum you can
look<00:03:09.170> anywhere<00:03:09.470> online<00:03:09.830> if<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.340> don't

believe<00:03:10.940> me<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:12.680> buy<00:03:12.860> them<00:03:13.040> between<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.519> 5000k

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
believe me to buy them between the 5000k

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.660 
believe me to buy them between the 5000k
to<00:03:14.989> 10,000<00:03:15.560> k<00:03:15.709> spectrum<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.370> they<00:03:16.459> will

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
to 10,000 k spectrum and they will

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.930 
to 10,000 k spectrum and they will
effectively<00:03:17.680> send<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> correct<00:03:19.250> spectrum<00:03:19.820> of

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
effectively send the correct spectrum of

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.940 
effectively send the correct spectrum of

finding<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.550> dead<00:04:13.970> fish<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.599> there's<00:04:14.840> no

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
finding a dead fish and there's no

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.800 
finding a dead fish and there's no
evidence<00:04:15.290> of<00:04:15.650> why<00:04:15.890> they<00:04:16.099> died

evidence of why they died

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.410 
evidence of why they died
maybe<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.930> was<00:04:18.960> just<00:04:19.080> old<00:04:19.500> age<00:04:20.180> because<00:04:21.180> you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
maybe it was just old age because you

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.690 
maybe it was just old age because you
didn't<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.600> any<00:04:21.780> kind<00:04:22.050> of<00:04:22.250> illness<00:04:23.250> or

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
right but yeah there's the repense it's

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.210 
right but yeah there's the repense it's
like<00:06:38.840> going<00:06:39.840> buck<00:06:40.170> wild<00:06:40.200> now<00:06:40.650> that<00:06:40.890> I<00:06:40.920> trimmed

like going buck wild now that I trimmed

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.620 
like going buck wild now that I trimmed
it<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:41.520> stuff<00:06:41.760> it's<00:06:42.030> just<00:06:42.150> starting<00:06:42.390> to<00:06:42.420> take

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
it and stuff it's just starting to take

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.410 
it and stuff it's just starting to take
it<00:06:42.750> off<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:42.870> go<00:06:43.080> ape<00:06:43.290> so<00:06:44.180> probably<00:06:45.180> going<00:06:45.360> to

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
it off and go ape so probably going to

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.560 
it off and go ape so probably going to
have<00:06:45.510> to<00:06:45.570> trim<00:06:45.870> it<00:06:45.960> again<00:06:46.170> soon<00:06:46.440> so<00:06:47.450> all<00:06:48.450> right

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
have to trim it again soon so all right

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.590 
have to trim it again soon so all right
I<00:06:48.780> think<00:06:49.230> it's<00:06:49.350> a<00:06:49.590> good<00:06:50.070> enough<00:06:50.330> video<00:06:51.330> for<00:06:51.570> a

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
I think it's a good enough video for a

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.980 
I think it's a good enough video for a
Saturday<00:06:51.960> night<00:06:52.140> I<00:06:52.350> later
