00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:10.300
 and work ring more than 30 years I 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.350
 created already for more than 200 films 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.350
 this gunsmith 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.360
 I make a drawing on paper for later 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 use it as a template and make by 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.320
 him a few betarangs i'm going 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.300
 do no batarang because I want 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.580
 poke them wall so you need to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 enough know for those who think that 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.989
 line tracing is not real 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.360
 work i do these betarangs i cut out 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.430
 metal pattern to all baht rank 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.410
 turned out the same size of course I 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.180
 I can cut them by the eye but then everything 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.900
 six pieces would not be so 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 neat 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.100
 I cut out the template using the already known 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.590
 you berry balls these scissors for metal 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.020
 can even pass steel thickness of 2 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 centimeter at the template after dinner rishar 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 the edges are razor sharp so 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.290
 amazing how I didn't cut my hands 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.640
 this batarang is 30 centimeters wide and he 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.640
 more than they were movie 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.330
 Now I can cut 6 betarangs with 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.010
 using a plasma cutter plasma 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 the cutter is not the neat cutting 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.270
 subject most plasma cutters 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.190
 computer controlled i do it 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 manually because of this on the back 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.290
 left a lot on the mountains see me 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 how many movies about batman and even 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.970
 worked on three of them batman always 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 batman and robin and do something for 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 belt buckles for bane film dark 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 knight revival legends 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 the trang from the movie almost no sharp 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.900
 edges so i will add and to make 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 their more dangerous 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.030
 I am processing all six betarangs on 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.500
 belt grinding machine so that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.060
 they were one form 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.220
 they must meet certain 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.320
 parameters to be balanced 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.330
 and sharp photo frames are very similar to 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.090
 Japanese weapon shurikens 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.370
 star shape so I also make them from 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 hardened steel and sharpen both 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.090
 parties to make it clear what they are 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.060
 different in what i do for the movie 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.220
 i will say those were made of aluminum they 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.769
 were the usual requisites we are just fine 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.019
 looked on set but this is another thing 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.940
 they will be hardened released thanks to 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.940
 this is really dangerous 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.740
 now i use pneumatic 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.170
 grinding belt machine i 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.930
 I am going to burn the betarangs in the furnace so 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.510
 how do i use dense steel grade 75 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.640
 would taranki need to be heated to a temperature 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.650
 815 degrees usually somewhere 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.870
 in the oil hisses and gurgles and then 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.970
 cools decided to show it to you so you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.970
 have seen how batarang looks on fire 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 here they are after black 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.840
 oxidizer 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.760
 black oxidizer is something like i am 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.140
 black rust which penetrates 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.140
 top metal layers 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840
 I usually do both blade swords and sabers 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.329
 razor sharp but in this case i 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.879
 I will not do this, but if you compare 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.950
 the betarangs are as sharp as an ax blade 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.829
 5 imba the rank is not easy for props 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.099
 these betarangs may just stick in 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.099
 the enemy 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 translated and voiced by the command x
