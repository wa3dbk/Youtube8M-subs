00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.010
 to find a new phase era 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.010
 yeah behind me to know myself and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 something different something that interests me 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.669
 and something that interests me 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.849
 something sweet children 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 I've seen some pretty incredible things happen at the sessions 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.619
 some upset me 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.039
 some have advanced 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.039
 but I doubt that for me it's a new approach 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.330
 I do not have a game 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.500
 the idea of ​​a group at first but it's a very different group 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 other groups that can be found elsewhere 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.110
 the speech 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.120
 light who were having fun and then during the movement these are two very small 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.740
 movements 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 very easy to achieve quite amazing 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.120
 for the most part I skate 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.110
 at first we did not do anything and when we go out sessions are 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 completely upset sometimes very criticized 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.510
 sometimes we get hot sometimes we get cold we see in any case that his control of his 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 stuffy 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940
 and here we say we exist 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.180
 so we come to see me at the start, we wonder why 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.700
 and then little by little we need it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.570
 we are waiting impatiently 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.960
 netapp help 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.140
 reborn and I got your first year I left 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.240
 very sad 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 while the stanley cup I have no less than 21 years younger 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.950
 and then in fact we realize very quickly that it is necessary and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 prolonged in the body is old is a very good my back is better 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.090
 calm 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.620
 surprisingly enough 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.740
 with the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.010
 tiny little little 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.530
 and a new self-knowledge in the face of towers 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.759
 yes, of a concert, we have a force that loves each other 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.640
 clubs that sets up a room 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 like that quite naturally as if when to master much more 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.170
 youth movements 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.760
 still a great self-control a great 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.320
 a great action 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.570
 a greater deployment of his being is quite natural is absolutely 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.380
 without effort and that's what is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.119
 really very amazing 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.269
 I noticed that all of a sudden I slept a lot better and I'm going 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.950
 to campaign to monopolize all the spaces of the museum 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.050
 and suddenly I was sleeping otherwise people completely quirky and in a 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.350
 any new position that makes that reproduce 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.449
 agree on one side or the other 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.879
 and that it had me that had hit me and I'm sure it's a blow I 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.989
 takes the space of a short 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.919
 a word again in hanoi 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.139
 it is under his authority to afford two cuts from the uefa 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.929
 unconsciously 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.709
 unconsciously 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.269
 and that's quite amazing 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.869
 the fact that there is no mirror facing much more 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.599
 we have to be self-centered for once 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.549
 the perspective of both 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.279
 performance of 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.290
 a kitten can as he can with his own means 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.799
 and engages but the other attacker but there we are for the centers and especially 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.599
 evening 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.949
 ferey 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.549
 often hurt light 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.450
 that's what I'm asked for in addition to separating them 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.150
 to let boats pass when you work your little finger 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.250
 we think we're good guys there's never been saved but never 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.669
 December is still started time when the disease 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.089
 help me 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.099
 and then little by little 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.249
 in ontario 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.259
 in c2 perso 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.199
 by focusing I think it also takes 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.279
 much to focus 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.099
 for sure be its movement the cdc 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.089
 it's one thirty 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.609
 this is the only hour thirty that gerard m at least five innings 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.239
 not granting the week 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.099
 % 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.709
 really for me 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.579
 it's for the moment on my arrival the same 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.059
 the batter not to miss the wish
