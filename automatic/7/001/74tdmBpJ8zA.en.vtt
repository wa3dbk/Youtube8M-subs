 circles 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.600
 such from two sides sticking sheets and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.600
 fees and from here it kicks off 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.990
 in short so ripped off which takes 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 two-sided such very and this one myself 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:04.300
 fastened it turns out yes and now these handouts 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 they are also a two-sided dozen 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.590
 is attached and here it is 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:21.740
 so that it can go there by it 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:24.230
 hide and in general as something like this in 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:31.330
 the end won't look like then of course 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:34.610
 so let me show you now 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.209
 by the way here is such a mechanism 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.610
 quartz here we need here 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:47.739
 The battery is written as follows: 2 2 and I in advance 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.739
 prepared bought such a little battery 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.780
 put here later 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.350
 So 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:07.690
 fighting with yes on every such in 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:11.560
 plastic square on the figure if 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.440
 Here is a film that turns out 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.440
 really we do not try something 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.730
 not geraniums and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:30.040
 whom mirror mirror reflection 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:35.440
 it turns out so it turns out we pass 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.920
 from here it goes further 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.750
 the hour hand 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.300
 then let them down as it should 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.110
 don't even want to hurt anything 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.110
 fingers leave there 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:14.370
 for about a second 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.370
 arrow 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:50.820
 We see immediately that we check something wrong 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.820
 put all our actions here and. 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.320
 so this is all we take of course this is all 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.270
 at the very end 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.340
 the end result will see it all 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:30.190
 here, too, with this all clear that 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.190
