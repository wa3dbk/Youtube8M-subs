looking<00:00:54.020> at<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.260> cutback<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.250> cutback<00:00:55.700> is

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
looking at the cutback the cutback is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.910 
looking at the cutback the cutback is
both<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.360> beginner<00:00:56.809> maneuver<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.410> first<00:00:57.650> move

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
both a beginner maneuver the first move

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.590 
both a beginner maneuver the first move
you<00:00:58.040> know<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.370> do<00:00:58.610> as<00:00:59.059> well<00:00:59.300> as<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.450> very

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
you know how to do as well as a very

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360 
you know how to do as well as a very
complex<00:01:00.170> move<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:00.800> you're<00:01:00.890> try<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.160> do<00:01:01.280> it

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
complex move when you're try and do it

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.400 
complex move when you're try and do it
like<00:01:01.460> Taylor<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:08.300> without<00:01:08.570> further<00:01:08.840> ado

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
like Taylor not so without further ado

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.080 
like Taylor not so without further ado
let's<00:01:09.770> get<00:01:09.950> off<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.250> beat<00:01:10.430> into<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.820> water

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
let's get off the beat into the water

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.950 
let's get off the beat into the water
and<00:01:11.270> break<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.630> down<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:17.210> approach<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.750> set

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
and break it down the approach and set

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.900 
and break it down the approach and set
up<00:01:18.050> for<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.260> cutback<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:19.100> slightly<00:01:19.400> different

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
up for the cutback is slightly different

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.520 
up for the cutback is slightly different
to<00:01:20.000> other<00:01:20.149> maneuvers<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:20.930> isn't<00:01:21.140> quite

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
to other maneuvers and that isn't quite

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.020 
to other maneuvers and that isn't quite
as<00:01:21.680> important<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.399> get<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.670> angles

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
as important that you get the angles

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.550 
as important that you get the angles
just<00:01:23.090> right<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.960> approach<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.290> in

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
just right you can approach it in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.990 
just right you can approach it in
different<00:01:24.740> ways<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.369> though<00:01:25.460> many<00:01:25.670> different

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
different ways and though many different

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.330 
different ways and though many different
variations<00:01:26.380> you'll<00:01:27.380> see<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.890> surfers

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
variations you'll see that the surfers

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.670 
variations you'll see that the surfers
approach<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.790> quite<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.149> slight<00:01:29.810> angle<00:01:30.290> making

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
approach to quite a slight angle making

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.109 
approach to quite a slight angle making
sure<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.950> gets<00:01:31.040> nice<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.310> high<00:01:31.700> up<00:01:31.820> on<00:01:32.000> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
sure it gets nice and high up on the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.660 
sure it gets nice and high up on the
wave<00:01:32.300> before<00:01:32.810> he<00:01:33.110> starts<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.710> turn<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.430> most

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
wave before he starts to turn the most

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.219 
wave before he starts to turn the most
important<00:01:35.149> part<00:01:35.360> about<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.570> cutback<00:01:35.990> is

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
important part about a cutback is

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.690 
important part about a cutback is
getting<00:01:36.560> nice<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.740> low<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.250> compression

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
getting nice and low that compression

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.150 
getting nice and low that compression
and<00:01:38.030> then<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.630> rotation<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.500> can<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.070> how

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
and then the rotation you can see how

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.760 
and then the rotation you can see how
his<00:01:40.340> body<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.759> rotating<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.630> we're<00:01:42.320> looking

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
his body is rotating and we're looking

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.620 
his body is rotating and we're looking
where<00:01:42.920> he's<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:43.789> helping<00:01:44.330> him<00:01:44.450> get

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
where he's going really helping him get

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
where he's going really helping him get
some<00:01:44.869> speed<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.410> drive<00:01:45.649> through<00:01:45.979> that<00:01:46.009> turn<00:01:46.430> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
some speed and drive through that turn a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.670 
some speed and drive through that turn a
little<00:01:47.270> bit<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.450> compression<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.320> legs

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
little bit of compression in the legs

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.830 
little bit of compression in the legs
then<00:01:49.250> goes<00:01:49.490> into<00:01:49.789> extension<00:01:50.119> which<00:01:50.479> gets<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
then goes into extension which gets a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200 
then goes into extension which gets a
nice<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.320> high<00:01:51.500> up<00:01:51.710> where<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.610> can<00:01:52.729> then<00:01:52.939> do

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
nice and high up where you can then do

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.120 
nice and high up where you can then do
almost<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.720> backhand<00:01:54.229> top<00:01:54.500> turn<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:55.040> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
almost like a backhand top turn on the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.609 
almost like a backhand top turn on the
rebound<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.790> come<00:01:56.630> back<00:01:56.810> down<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.080> complete<00:01:57.590> a

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
rebound to come back down and complete a

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.169 
rebound to come back down and complete a
full<00:01:57.920> roundhouse<00:01:58.369> cutback

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.440 

one

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
one

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
one
there<00:02:07.049> are<00:02:07.140> many<00:02:07.290> different<00:02:07.650> variations<00:02:07.740> they

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
there are many different variations they

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
there are many different variations they
cut<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.670> they<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
cut back they don't all have to be the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380 
cut back they don't all have to be the
round<00:02:10.590> us<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.400> he<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.640> seize<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.880> poster

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
round us this one he can seize a poster

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.360 
round us this one he can seize a poster
with<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:12.750> speed<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.349> he's<00:02:13.800> almost<00:02:14.160> just

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
with more speed and he's almost just

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.520 
with more speed and he's almost just
pushing<00:02:14.849> through<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.239> more<00:02:15.450> not<00:02:16.080> getting<00:02:16.410> his

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
pushing through it more not getting his

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710 
pushing through it more not getting his
high<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> rebound<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.060> coming<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.569> of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
high up on the rebound but coming out of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.360 
high up on the rebound but coming out of
it<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> lot<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> speed

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.130 

here's<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> nice<00:02:23.640> laid<00:02:23.940> back<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.480> his<00:02:24.750> body<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
here's a nice laid back one his body is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
here's a nice laid back one his body is
fully<00:02:25.530> extended<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.940> definitely<00:02:27.239> not

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
fully extended this is definitely not

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
fully extended this is definitely not
your<00:02:27.510> textbook<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.010> looks<00:02:29.190> pretty

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
your textbook one but it looks pretty

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970 
your textbook one but it looks pretty
stylish<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.270> he<00:02:30.959> still<00:02:31.230> comes<00:02:31.500> out<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.890> this

this<00:02:58.500> way<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.950> three<00:03:02.250> most<00:03:02.459> common<00:03:02.610> mistakes

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
this way the three most common mistakes

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.090 
this way the three most common mistakes
that<00:03:03.480> people<00:03:03.630> make<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> cutback<00:03:04.650> are

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
that people make with a cutback are

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.640 
that people make with a cutback are
firstly<00:03:05.640> trying<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.569> turn<00:03:06.810> too<00:03:07.140> hard<00:03:07.440> at<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
firstly trying to turn too hard at the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.229 
firstly trying to turn too hard at the
beginning<00:03:07.769> which<00:03:08.489> means<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.850> lose<00:03:09.000> all<00:03:09.209> your

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
beginning which means you lose all your

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.449 
beginning which means you lose all your
speed<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.200> can<00:03:10.410> go<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> nice<00:03:11.130> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
speed so you can go into it nice and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.930 
speed so you can go into it nice and
slow

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
slow

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.729 
slow
and<00:03:12.030> hold<00:03:12.510> your<00:03:12.630> speed<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.200> through<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
and hold your speed right through the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.920 
and hold your speed right through the
turn<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.519> next<00:03:14.850> mistake<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.209> straightening

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
turn the next mistake is straightening

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.960 
turn the next mistake is straightening
your<00:03:16.049> legs<00:03:16.260> too<00:03:16.530> early<00:03:16.890> try<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.609> keep<00:03:17.760> them
