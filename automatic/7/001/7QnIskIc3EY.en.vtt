in so why don't you start talking about

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.830

it<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.640> are<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.789> looking<00:00:21.029> at<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.270> what

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it what are we looking at here what

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.450 
it what are we looking at here what
you're<00:00:22.020> looking<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> Firefox<00:00:23.250> OS

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you're looking at here is a Firefox OS

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.480 
you're looking at here is a Firefox OS
device<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.539> very<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.170> low-level<00:00:26.099> device

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
device it's a very very low-level device

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.300 
device it's a very very low-level device
basically<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.349> had<00:00:28.529> Android<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
basically do if I had Android on it the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.769 
basically do if I had Android on it the
only<00:00:29.340> Android<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.939> would<00:00:30.119> still<00:00:30.359> run<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
only Android that would still run is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.139 
only Android that would still run is
honeycomb<00:00:31.199> okay<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> idea<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.940> one

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
honeycomb okay so the idea of that one

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
honeycomb okay so the idea of that one
is<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.600> bring<00:00:33.750> web<00:00:33.989> connectivity<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is that we bring web connectivity to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
is that we bring web connectivity to
people<00:00:34.890> who<00:00:35.190> cannot<00:00:35.430> afford<00:00:35.579> smartphones<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
people who cannot afford smartphones so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
people who cannot afford smartphones so
we<00:00:37.170> bring<00:00:37.320> emerging<00:00:37.800> markets<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.520> South

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
we bring emerging markets like South

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
we bring emerging markets like South
America<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.360> where<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.719> start

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
America is where we're gonna start

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
America is where we're gonna start
Eastern<00:00:40.590> Europe<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.520> our<00:00:41.820> idea<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.300> Mozilla<00:00:42.840> as

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
Eastern Europe so our idea of Mozilla as

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
Eastern Europe so our idea of Mozilla as
a<00:00:42.989> foundation<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.800> bring<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> web<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
a foundation is to bring the web to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
a foundation is to bring the web to
people<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.230> means<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
people and if right now this means that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
people and if right now this means that
you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> money<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you have to have a lot of money for a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
you have to have a lot of money for a
new<00:00:48.059> smartphone<00:00:48.420> every<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:48.930> months<00:00:49.110> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
new smartphone every two months that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.229 
new smartphone every two months that's
just<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.039> fair<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.850> thought<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just not fair now so we thought it's a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
just not fair now so we thought it's a
good<00:00:51.270> idea<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.840> bring<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.140> platform<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
good idea to bring a platform into the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
good idea to bring a platform into the
play<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.879> run<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.719> low

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
play that could run on very very low

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
play that could run on very very low
spec<00:00:55.260> hardware<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.190> still<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> good

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
spec hardware but still have a good

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.729 
spec hardware but still have a good
performance<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.780> course<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> can't<00:00:58.350> compare

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
performance of course you can't compare

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
performance of course you can't compare
it<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.640> with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> nexus<00:01:00.480> 4

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it with an with an with the nexus 4

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
it with an with an with the nexus 4
right<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.410> an<00:01:01.500> iPhone<00:01:01.859> 5<00:01:02.190> but

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
right now or with an iPhone 5 but

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
right now or with an iPhone 5 but
actually<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> idea<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
actually the idea is that we want to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually the idea is that we want to
replace<00:01:04.769> feature<00:01:05.580> phones<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
replace feature phones with this so we

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.880 
replace feature phones with this so we
want<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:06.990> rid<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> old<00:01:07.500> Nokia

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
want to get rid of the old Nokia

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
want to get rid of the old Nokia

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.170 
cap caching as well it gets the data
offline<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.370> next<00:04:01.519> time<00:04:01.759> when<00:04:01.909> I'm<00:04:02.030> there

offline so next time when I'm there
sound<00:04:02.479> card<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.810> much<00:04:02.959> faster<00:04:03.139> cuz<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.560> don't

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
sound card is much faster cuz I don't

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.719 
sound card is much faster cuz I don't
have<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:03.919> don't<00:04:04.099> look<00:04:04.250> down<00:04:04.459> with<00:04:04.639> the

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
have to don't look down with the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.339 
have to don't look down with the
interface<00:04:05.120> anymore<00:04:05.569> because<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.199> already

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
interface anymore because it's already

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.009 
interface anymore because it's already
there<00:04:06.650> for<00:04:06.889> me<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.269> benefit<00:04:08.689> of<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:08.989> of

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
there for me so the benefit of all of

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.809 
there for me so the benefit of all of
this<00:04:09.319> is<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.859> phone<00:04:10.099> will<00:04:10.280> be<00:04:10.430> very<00:04:10.639> very

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
this is that the phone will be very very

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.499 
this is that the phone will be very very
cheap<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.509> achieve<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.919> actually

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:13.509 
cheap to achieve and it is actually

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.819 
cheap to achieve and it is actually
updating<00:04:14.509> constantly<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:15.229> well<00:04:15.439> so<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.709> don't

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
updating constantly as well so I don't

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.580 
updating constantly as well so I don't
have<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.459> problem<00:04:16.909> that<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.329> very<00:04:18.139> low-end

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
have the problem that a very low-end

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.349 
have the problem that a very low-end

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
phone doesn't get newer versions of the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.020 
phone doesn't get newer versions of the
operating<00:04:20.479> system<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.440> quickly
