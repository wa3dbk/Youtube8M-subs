philosophies<00:04:31.800> still<00:04:32.100> stand<00:04:32.580> strong<00:04:33.710> we<00:04:34.710> don't

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
philosophies still stand strong we don't

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.879 
philosophies still stand strong we don't
want<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.090> over<00:04:36.360> treat<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.470> intervene

where<00:04:38.160> there<00:04:38.550> doesn't<00:04:38.729> need<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.000> be

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
where there doesn't need to be

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.330 
where there doesn't need to be
intervention<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:40.470> actually<00:04:41.009> takes<00:04:41.220> a

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
intervention and this actually takes a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.460 
intervention and this actually takes a
lot<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.520> effort<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.180> lot<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.570> explanation<00:04:43.259> but

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
lot of effort a lot of explanation but

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.439 
lot of effort a lot of explanation but
in<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> end<00:04:43.919> it's<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.580> much<00:04:44.729> better<00:04:44.910> medicine

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
in the end it's a much better medicine

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.150 
in the end it's a much better medicine
