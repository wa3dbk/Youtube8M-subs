00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 earthquake of magnitude 8.6 in 1787 triggered 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.880
 the biggest tsunami in mexico the chapter 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.769
 registered more than two centuries ago 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 suggests that on the coasts of Mexico or 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 Central America can repeat the event 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.060
 the tsunami dragged the inhabitants of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 the coasts to mountains located at 6 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.400
 kilometers of the coasts of oaxaca and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.850
 Warrior 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 the 8.6 earthquake was triggered by a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.890
 rupture of the tectonic plates in front 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.199
 to the coasts of Guerrero and Oaxaca 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.230
 for the next 141 years I do not know 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.540
 major earthquakes recorded the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 strong seismological activity reappeared 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 in 1928 and then in 1965 Mexico covered 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.960
 by seismic sensors the seismic alert 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.910
 expands its coverage the largest tsunami in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 that has record in mexico swept 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 with the coasts of oaxaca and guerrero 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.829
 more than two centuries after an earthquake in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.660
 magnitude of 8.6 and a gigantic wave neither 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 an earthquake of these magnitudes has been 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 registered since then in the country of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.340
 according to a study published by the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 seismic society of america 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 mounted fishermen picked up 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 his networks on March 28 , 1787 when 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.460
 they watched as the water receded 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.110
 quickly seaward to leave the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 discovered sand of various colors 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 marine plants and shrubs according to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 study of the researchers gerardo 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.290
 Suarez and Paola Albin and the water returned 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.970
 with such force that it left the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 inhabitants of the coasts on the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.200
 mountain trees located at 6 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 kilometers of the coasts according to stories 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 mentioned in the study in which no 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.610
 Death figures are included in oaxaca 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.220
 the sea flooded the coasts of pochutla 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 now called angel port just like 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 tehuantepec where the sea invaded the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.000
 earth with terrible sounds leaving 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.159
 fish and algae in strange ways the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.259
 wharf of acapulco in warrior one of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.869
 The most popular tourist ports in 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.950
 the news was flooded by 24 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.990
 hours 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.820
 this earthquake seems to be one of the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.829
 major events that have occurred as 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 throughout the subduction zone during 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.330
 last 500 years describes the document 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.400
 that collects reports of the scarce 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.430
 population that inhabited those coasts and of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.349
 the cities inland that chapter 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.090
 of the country's seismic history 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.280
 suggests that an event of this magnitude 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.230
 can be repeated on the coasts of mexico 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.959
 and Central America in very long periods 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.880
 of time concludes the study evidence 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.670
 of a large earthquake genetic tsunami at 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.459
 long of the Mexican zone of subduction 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.830
 published in 2009 the earthquake was such 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.870
 magnitude that caused significant damage and 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.910
 the collapse of buildings and structures 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.130
 well done as convents churches 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.069
 government offices and buildings 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.480
 private details the study 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.599
 a rupture of the sea floor of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.299
 approximately 450 kilometers long 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.819
 caused the 8.6 magnitude earthquake that 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.430
 generated the wave the days after the 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.640
 earthquake and tsunami 29 and 30 and March and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.040
 on April 3 , 1787 occurred 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.680
 replicas of around 7 degrees but 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.910
 for the next 141 years there was 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.630
 tranquility 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.670
 in 1928 the seismic activity was reactivated 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.920
 with a new series of strong earthquakes 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.240
 intensity of a magnitude between 5 and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:24.270
 6 in Oaxaca the series was repeated years 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:27.830
 1965 1968 1978 and 1996 without provoking 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.830
 great damage to that state
