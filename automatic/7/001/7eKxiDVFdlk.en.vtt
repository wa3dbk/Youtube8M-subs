revived either but that has not said

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.720

anything<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.050> yet<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.489> saying

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
anything about it yet and I'm not saying

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.689 
anything about it yet and I'm not saying
that's<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> bad<00:00:54.180> idea<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.010> headshots

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that's a bad idea but I think headshots

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.959 
that's a bad idea but I think headshots
are<00:00:57.090> mostly<00:00:57.600> simple<00:00:58.469> luck<00:00:58.859> or<00:00:59.070> uncontrolled

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
are mostly simple luck or uncontrolled

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
are mostly simple luck or uncontrolled
recoil<00:01:00.480> therefore<00:01:01.320> relatively<00:01:01.920> common<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
recoil therefore relatively common and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359 
recoil therefore relatively common and
very<00:01:02.760> random<00:01:03.480> most<00:01:04.260> players<00:01:04.559> aim<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.250> the

very random most players aim for the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
very random most players aim for the
chest<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> head<00:01:06.540> since<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> head<00:01:07.350> is

chest and not the head since the head is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.039 
chest and not the head since the head is
a<00:01:07.619> much<00:01:07.920> smaller<00:01:08.159> target<00:01:08.640> tissue<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> want
