bit<00:01:24.000> faster<00:01:24.479> than<00:01:24.630> normally<00:01:24.990> does<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.770> going

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
bit faster than normally does it's going

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
bit faster than normally does it's going
about<00:01:26.159> four<00:01:26.430> times<00:01:26.580> faster<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.240> you've

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
about four times faster because you've

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
about four times faster because you've
all<00:01:27.659> seen<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> stuff<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.220> care

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
all seen this stuff but you really care

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
all seen this stuff but you really care
about<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> numbers<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.390> pain<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.960> wish

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
about are the numbers in pain I wish

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.569 
about are the numbers in pain I wish
they<00:01:31.740> were<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:31.920> bigger<00:01:32.310> because

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
they were a little bigger because

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.090 
they were a little bigger because
they're<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.240> hard<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> read<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
they're kind of hard to read but on the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.679 
they're kind of hard to read but on the
top<00:01:35.280> left<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.820> left<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.710> temperature<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.040> on

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
top left I left out temperature so on

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.120 
top left I left out temperature so on
the<00:01:39.689> right-hand<00:01:40.049> side<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.979> number

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the right-hand side the first number

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
the right-hand side the first number
you'll<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.670> temperature<00:01:42.210> everything

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you'll see is temperature everything

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.399 
you'll see is temperature everything
else<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.770> hope<00:01:44.729> somewhat<00:01:45.570> explanatory<00:01:46.229> if

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
else is I hope somewhat explanatory if

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.069 
else is I hope somewhat explanatory if
not<00:01:46.619> let<00:01:46.860> me<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.220> basically<00:01:47.720> GPU<00:01:48.720> speed

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
not let me know it's basically GPU speed

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
not let me know it's basically GPU speed
memory<00:01:49.560> usage<00:01:49.829> memory<00:01:50.460> speed<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.119> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
memory usage memory speed and then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
memory usage memory speed and then
frames<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:52.500> last<00:01:52.560> number

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
frames would be the very last number

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
frames would be the very last number
which<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.579> keep<00:01:54.090> popping<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.540> number<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.869> screen

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
which I keep popping a number on screen

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.450 
which I keep popping a number on screen
just<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.100> an<00:01:56.189> idea<00:01:56.250> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
just so you can kind of get an idea of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.510 
just so you can kind of get an idea of
what<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> looks<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.380> anyway<00:01:58.799> again<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
what it looks like so anyway again just

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.100 
what it looks like so anyway again just

it looks like when you get a little

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.940 
it looks like when you get a little
more<00:02:13.659> proper<00:02:14.200> footage<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.920> again<00:02:15.219> I<00:02:16.829> wish<00:02:17.829> I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
could show you what it looks like

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.530 
could show you what it looks like
exactly<00:02:19.719> 3200<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.040> kind<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> crazy<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:22.359> is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
exactly 3200 it's kind of crazy there is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.050 
exactly 3200 it's kind of crazy there is
a<00:02:22.569> bug<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.079> speak<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:24.129> constantly<00:02:24.790> says

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
a bug to speak of it constantly says

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
a bug to speak of it constantly says
level<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.719> on<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.139> screen<00:02:26.409> you<00:02:27.099> can't<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.549> it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
level up on the screen you can't see it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.929 
level up on the screen you can't see it
because<00:02:27.819> how<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.170> 3200<00:02:30.159> box<00:02:30.519> frame

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
because how I have the 3200 box frame

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.660 
because how I have the 3200 box frame
but<00:02:31.629> trust<00:02:31.870> me<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.439> says<00:02:32.769> level<00:02:33.159> up<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.489> there

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
but trust me it says level up on there

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.089 
but trust me it says level up on there
and<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.969> has<00:02:34.180> said<00:02:34.450> level<00:02:34.810> up<00:02:34.989> since<00:02:35.379> well

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
and it has said level up since well

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.250 
and it has said level up since well
creating<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> character<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.719> time<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.079> level

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
creating the character and time to level

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.920 
creating the character and time to level
up<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.879> presume<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.060> goes<00:02:40.209> away<00:02:40.389> if<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:40.719> level

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
up I presume it goes away if you level

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.690 
up I presume it goes away if you level
up<00:02:41.169> but<00:02:41.560> honestly<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.189> haven't<00:02:42.400> had<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.609> chance

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
up but honestly I haven't had a chance

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.020 
up but honestly I haven't had a chance
to<00:02:42.999> play<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.450> find<00:02:43.659> out<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.889> that's<00:02:45.849> pretty

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
to play and find out so that's pretty

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.640 
to play and find out so that's pretty
much<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.389> Skyrim<00:02:46.750> looks<00:02:46.959> like<00:02:47.139> it's<00:02:47.319> crazy

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
much what Skyrim looks like it's crazy
