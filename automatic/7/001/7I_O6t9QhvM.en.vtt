you're talking about resistance levels

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.230 
you're talking about resistance levels
for<00:00:10.440> gold<00:00:10.590> prices<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.490> say<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.849> they've

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
for gold prices and you say that they've

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.369 
for gold prices and you say that they've
been<00:00:12.269> broken<00:00:12.660> through<00:00:14.900> yeah<00:00:15.900> sure<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.350> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
been broken through yeah sure if you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
been broken through yeah sure if you
look<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> gold<00:00:17.100> chair<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.760> connect<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
look at a gold chair and you connect the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.210 
look at a gold chair and you connect the
highs<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.960> back<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.350> march<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.800> thousand

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
highs going back to march two thousand

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.029 
highs going back to march two thousand
eight<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.090> sort<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> downward

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
eight you see sort of a downward

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
eight you see sort of a downward
resistance<00:00:23.039> line<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.180> clearly<00:00:24.480> broken

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
resistance line that was clearly broken

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
resistance line that was clearly broken
you<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.920> after<00:00:26.130> gold<00:00:26.550> went<00:00:26.760> above<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you know after gold went above the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.689 
you know after gold went above the
thousand<00:00:27.570> dollar<00:00:27.720> mark<00:00:28.099> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
thousand dollar mark you can see that it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.959 
thousand dollar mark you can see that it
just<00:00:30.179> shot<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> 1050<00:00:31.949> mark<00:00:32.189> i

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
just shot right up to the 1050 mark i

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
just shot right up to the 1050 mark i
suspect<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> we'll<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> correction<00:00:34.920> in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
suspect that we'll see a correction in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
suspect that we'll see a correction in
gold<00:00:35.280> sometime<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.079> next<00:00:37.200> three<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> six

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
gold sometime in the next three to six

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
gold sometime in the next three to six
months<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.670> happens<00:00:39.300> i<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:39.960> an

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
months if that happens i see that as an

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
months if that happens i see that as an
excellent<00:00:40.620> buying<00:00:40.860> opportunity<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.510> should

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
excellent buying opportunity you should

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.020 
excellent buying opportunity you should
be<00:00:42.840> buying<00:00:43.020> gold<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> long<00:00:43.950> run<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.850> not

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
be buying gold for the long run and not

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
be buying gold for the long run and not
trying<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> trade<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.590> ultimately

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
trying to trade it because ultimately

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.729 
trying to trade it because ultimately
gold<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:48.090> real<00:00:48.390> currency<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
gold is the only real currency in the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
gold is the only real currency in the
world<00:00:49.820> there's<00:00:50.820> only<00:00:51.000> five<00:00:51.270> trillion<00:00:51.629> dollars

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
world there's only five trillion dollars

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
world there's only five trillion dollars
worth<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> gold<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> world<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> that's<00:00:53.520> one

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
worth of gold in the world so that's one

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
worth of gold in the world so that's one
hundred<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> fifty-five<00:00:54.600> thousand<00:00:55.110> tons

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
hundred and fifty-five thousand tons

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
hundred and fifty-five thousand tons
compare<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> equity<00:00:57.059> market

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
compare that with the equity market

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840 
compare that with the equity market
which<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.600> forty<00:00:58.140> six<00:00:58.379> trillion<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.579> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
which is forty six trillion which is you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 
which is forty six trillion which is you
know<00:01:00.020> leverage<00:01:01.020> 3.6<00:01:01.800> times<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.579> all

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
know leverage 3.6 times because of all

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.899 
know leverage 3.6 times because of all
the<00:01:02.789> bonds<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:04.250> 5590<00:01:05.250> trillion<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the bonds and then 5590 trillion in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
the bonds and then 5590 trillion in
derivative<00:01:06.390> markets<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.680> much

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
derivative markets there's so much

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
derivative markets there's so much
leverage<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> world<00:01:08.909> today<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.960> hard

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
leverage in the world today that hard

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289 
leverage in the world today that hard
assets<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> theme<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
assets are going to be the theme for the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
assets are going to be the theme for the
next<00:01:12.570> decade<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.409> hold<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.130> gold

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
next decade so hold on to your gold

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.940 
next decade so hold on to your gold
particularly<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.630> gold<00:01:16.530> has<00:01:16.799> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
particularly because gold has an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
particularly because gold has an
eighty-one<00:01:17.520> percent<00:01:17.549> correlation<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
eighty-one percent correlation to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.039 
eighty-one percent correlation to
commodities<00:01:19.560> since<00:01:20.310> 1980<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.869> own

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
commodities since 1980 so if you own

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
commodities since 1980 so if you own
physical<00:01:22.710> gold<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.520> already<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.060> exposure

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
physical gold you already have exposure

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.840 
physical gold you already have exposure
to<00:01:24.630> commodities<00:01:25.229> okay<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> say

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to commodities okay so when you say

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420 
to commodities okay so when you say
correction<00:01:27.509> i<00:01:27.600> guess<00:01:27.780> investors<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> viewers

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
correction i guess investors and viewers

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.560 
correction i guess investors and viewers
that<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.180> big<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that there want to know how big of a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
that there want to know how big of a
correction<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> gold<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> coming<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> next

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
correction in gold is coming in the next

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
correction in gold is coming in the next
three<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> six<00:01:33.000> months<00:01:34.040> well<00:01:35.040> from<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
three to six months well from a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.390 
three to six months well from a
technical<00:01:35.880> standpoint<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.930> i<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.400> good

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
technical standpoint i think i see good

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.749 
technical standpoint i think i see good
support<00:01:38.909> levels<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> 962<00:01:40.369> 970<00:01:41.369> range<00:01:41.579> if

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
support levels at the 962 970 range if

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.539 
support levels at the 962 970 range if
you<00:01:41.880> look<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> charts<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> might

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you look at the charts you know it might

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
you look at the charts you know it might
go<00:01:44.759> further<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> IMF<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.159> claims

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
go further if the IMF you know claims

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
go further if the IMF you know claims
that<00:01:47.759> they're<00:01:47.970> trying<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.329> save<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> starving

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
could correct even more but in the long

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.649 
could correct even more but in the long
run<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.320> inevitable<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.189> i<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.850> gold

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
run it's inevitable that i think gold

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
run it's inevitable that i think gold
will<00:02:00.869> become<00:02:01.469> much<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:02.130> expensive<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
will become much much more expensive and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
will become much much more expensive and
i'm<00:02:03.479> saying<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:04.049> thousand<00:02:04.469> dollars<00:02:04.710> per

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
i'm saying two thousand dollars per

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.940 
i'm saying two thousand dollars per
ounce<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> next<00:02:05.969> three<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> five<00:02:06.450> years

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950

okay<00:02:07.950> giving<00:02:08.250> silver<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> better<00:02:09.239> buy<00:02:09.479> right

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
okay giving silver is a better buy right

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.890 
okay giving silver is a better buy right
now<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> say<00:02:10.649> gold<00:02:10.979> too

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
now because as you say gold too

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.860 
now because as you say gold too
silver<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.530> ratio<00:02:12.920> at<00:02:13.010> least<00:02:13.189> at<00:02:13.549> 59<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.269> out

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
silver the ratio at least at 59 is out

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.569 
silver the ratio at least at 59 is out
of<00:02:14.900> whack<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.680> maybe<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.099> next<00:02:16.280> three<00:02:16.489> to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
of whack so maybe in the next three to

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.550 
of whack so maybe in the next three to
five<00:02:16.700> years<00:02:16.780> silver<00:02:17.780> might<00:02:18.349> actually

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
five years silver might actually

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.089 
five years silver might actually
outperform<00:02:19.430> gold<00:02:20.530> sure<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.709> absolutely

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
outperform gold sure it absolutely

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.309 
outperform gold sure it absolutely
should<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.670> mean<00:02:22.849> if<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.450> go<00:02:23.569> back<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.989> time

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
should I mean if you go back to the time

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.350 
should I mean if you go back to the time
of<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:25.040> Roman<00:02:25.370> Empire<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.030> time<00:02:26.239> of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
of the Roman Empire and the time of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.929 
of the Roman Empire and the time of
Jesus<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.560> know<00:02:27.650> one<00:02:27.890> piece<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.280> gold<00:02:28.519> was<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
Jesus you know one piece of gold was the

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.020 
Jesus you know one piece of gold was the
time<00:02:29.150> was<00:02:29.870> worth<00:02:30.109> 12<00:02:30.709> pieces<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.129> silver<00:02:31.670> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
time was worth 12 pieces of silver so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.649 
time was worth 12 pieces of silver so
the<00:02:32.150> ratio<00:02:32.329> was<00:02:32.689> 12<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.170> one<00:02:33.349> today<00:02:34.189> it's<00:02:34.519> 59<00:02:35.450> to

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
the ratio was 12 to one today it's 59 to

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.149 
the ratio was 12 to one today it's 59 to
one<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.049> ratio<00:02:36.409> is<00:02:36.530> completely<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.129> of

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
one that ratio is completely out of

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.920 
one that ratio is completely out of
whack<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.209> will<00:02:38.299> come<00:02:38.420> down<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.659> at

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
whack I think it will come down to at

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.229 
whack I think it will come down to at
least<00:02:39.079> 30<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.189> next<00:02:40.430> couple<00:02:40.579> years<00:02:40.760> if

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
least 30 in the next couple years if

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.030 
least 30 in the next couple years if
that<00:02:41.720> happens<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.349> gold<00:02:42.530> goes<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.890> two

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that happens and gold goes to two

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.800 
that happens and gold goes to two
thousand<00:02:43.459> dollars<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:43.819> ounce<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.599> means

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
thousand dollars an ounce that means

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.449 
thousand dollars an ounce that means
silver<00:02:45.079> will<00:02:45.260> be<00:02:45.379> treating<00:02:45.739> at<00:02:45.829> about<00:02:46.040> sixty

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
silver will be treating at about sixty

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.819 
silver will be treating at about sixty
six<00:02:46.730> dollars<00:02:47.150> per<00:02:47.180> ounce<00:02:47.510> from<00:02:48.440> where<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.709> is

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
six dollars per ounce from where it is

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.199 
six dollars per ounce from where it is
today<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.129> silver<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.730> an<00:02:49.849> excellent

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
today so silver is an excellent

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.259 
today so silver is an excellent
investment<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:51.709> along<00:02:52.040> with<00:02:52.069> gold<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.760> see

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
investment to go along with gold I see

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.729 
investment to go along with gold I see
that<00:02:53.420> China<00:02:53.690> has<00:02:53.900> been<00:02:53.989> encouraging<00:02:54.500> private

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
that China has been encouraging private

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.710 
that China has been encouraging private
investors<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.489> buy<00:02:55.639> silver<00:02:56.000> bullion<00:02:56.329> for<00:02:56.659> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
investors to buy silver bullion for the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.690 
investors to buy silver bullion for the
first<00:02:56.959> time<00:02:57.139> in<00:02:57.319> history<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.159> I<00:02:58.189> think<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.519> is

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
first time in history so I think this is

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 
first time in history so I think this is
an<00:02:58.819> unprecedented<00:02:59.209> opportunity<00:02:59.959> just<00:03:00.739> think

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
an unprecedented opportunity just think

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.729 
an unprecedented opportunity just think
of<00:03:01.040> silver<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.609> leveraged<00:03:02.030> gold<00:03:02.470> once<00:03:03.470> gold

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
of silver is leveraged gold once gold

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.229 
of silver is leveraged gold once gold
goes<00:03:03.950> up<00:03:04.189> silver<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.579> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:04.879> up<00:03:04.909> more

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
goes up silver is going to go up more

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.179 
goes up silver is going to go up more
when<00:03:05.540> when<00:03:05.840> gold<00:03:06.079> pulls<00:03:06.349> back<00:03:06.620> silver<00:03:07.040> is

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
when when gold pulls back silver is

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.220 
when when gold pulls back silver is
going<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> pull<00:03:07.579> back<00:03:07.760> more<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.569> both<00:03:08.810> metals

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
going to pull back more but both metals

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.319 
going to pull back more but both metals
make<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.829> lot<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.099> sense<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.609> we<00:03:10.730> do<00:03:10.939> have<00:03:11.120> long
