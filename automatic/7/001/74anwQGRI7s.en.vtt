00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
 wanna write one more so last 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.719
 there is a lot of time on my channel 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.269
 tag just quite recently 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.030
 amazing girl young mommy 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.260

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 anastasia 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.550
 suggested I write down the current mostly 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 so she came up with herself she chose 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 some interesting questions questions 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 relates to completely different genres and 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.769
 put them together in one tag and called it 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.750
 tag with my eyes in general idea to me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.290
 really liked and I supported this 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 the idea to shoot just such a tick so 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 girls get acquainted with Nastya and not 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.640
 keep watching this video 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.280
 and the first question is that you 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.190
 Most laugh for the past 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.160
 week month in general I want to say 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.380
 one you are all very positive to me 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.490
 deed man and if I laugh 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.040
 some kind of joke 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.220
 then I can remember very long and 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.710
 very long laugh mostly we are very 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 very very often trouble 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.200
 before losing pulse to stomach cramps when 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.260
 i meet my sisters 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.990
 when we are in general in the village 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.450
 covered neutral territory with us 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.940
 some very, very frequent 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.119
 pens and we laugh honestly say because 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.759
 so for the last week 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.670
 month I laughed a lot with him 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.009
 because they often see their sisters 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.619
 question number two if you were given 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.310
 free flight ticket wherever you are 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.619
 flew and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.690
 but in general girls I want to say and but 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.540
 if they gave me a free ticket to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.790
 the plane I would seem to me first thing 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 One hundred percent would fly to Russia 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.590
 flew to Moscow because I 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.110
 I really, really, want to visit me too 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.119
 exactly there is europe of course me 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 attracts no less but nevertheless i 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.490
 I would love to go to Moscow and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.649
 I would meet with bloggers from Moscow 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.929
 girls i talk to 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.560
 general had a good time was and 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.440
 then I already thought about going to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.380
 Europe and the first thing I would like to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.380
 visit in general 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.340
 Russia the third question is what will you choose the money 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.910
 or love but it seems to me first many 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 girls constantly but how would there be Katka 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.580
 Oredezh and who think that the Haggadah 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.660
 this love money is always needed 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.160
 I do not think so but I think the fact that a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.160
 love i would surely choose love 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.980
 but the money they are of course the future too 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.459
 very, very important at 1 place of course 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.680
 worth love but as far as i know 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.420
 many families break up in the future because of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.260
 problems with financial problems with money 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.920
 so 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.050
 I think the first place 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 always need to put love and then already 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.520
 money but still money is also 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.819
 an integral part of our life as it were 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.980
 regrettable it sounded 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.140
 question number 4 if someone will write 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.680
 and you book what is her name 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.780
 will be 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 I thought for a long time how to answer this 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.060
 question I want to say something that probably 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.300
 struggle with your fears I would call 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.260
 a book about myself often i want to do something 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.780
 I'm afraid 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.810
 and precisely overcome their fears their 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.700
 some phobias so probably a book about 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.230
 currently only so i would call it because 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.250
 this question actually made me 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.319
 think because you are very simple 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.930
 interesting and from the same time on it 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.000
 difficult to answer 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.970
 the next question is a favorite cartoon from 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.040
 my childhood and undoubtedly my favorite 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:56.840
 childhood is a cartoon 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.860
 I want to go home also loved cartoons 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.950
 Vince and 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.829
 p0 total spice there i don't know oh these 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.500
 babies in general then with hernia on my 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.190
 peers that remembers knows you probably 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.530
 likes these cartoons too 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.039
 what genre of film do you really love 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.729
 business and the genre of the film I would prefer 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:22.850
 probably melodramas and horror films so i like 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.539
 i so i love to tie and 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.810
 cry 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.479
 mode yes these are two such incompatible 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.820
 things but at the same time I want to say that 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.070
 i don't really like comedy even though man i 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.050
 actually with a sense of humor i love 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.789
 very much black humor for me is 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.970
 very very funny 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.570
 those who have not watched the film intolerable grandfather 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.550
 and if you well you have such a black humor 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.169
 prevails 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.750
 In general, then you probably memory this movie 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.900
 if you don't like movies with mats like that 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.120
 send you you sent from her in general then you 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.770
 you won't like this movie you say 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.599
 he and Nastya and what are you looking 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.720
 but if you are a person like me 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.580
 watch the film unbearable grandfather 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.729
 it was recently spun in 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.949
 cinemas we went with my line up whether 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.169
 this movie and we were just lying around 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.780
 cinema under the seat name with laughter 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.930
 because this is exactly the category 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.699
 of our humor and love very much horror 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.860
 which song matches yours 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.080
 mood at the moment in general 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 girls and I want to say what is it 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.190
 Song downright matches 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.110
 mood but it's just spinning around me 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:44.180
 In my head for a few days, let's 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:46.610
 together and listen in your opinion who 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.789
 main husband or wife in the family 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.550
 I always think that my husband should be 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.039
 chief of the family but the wife should not 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.900
 completely somehow obey his wife 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:03.229
 should somehow technically do so 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.440
 the husband thought that in actual action 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:10.280
 come from him but really like 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.770
 would my wife have been a provocateur of all this in 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.639
 In general, the wife should act smarter than 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.490
 and her husband 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.190
 so that it seems to her husband that he really is 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.580
 Chief in general, something like this 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.060
 opinions held that better and 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.060
 tastier than chocolate it will be 10 question and I 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:33.110
 I will answer just one picture in general 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.949
 then this question here girls what for me 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.630
 tastier than chocolate really want sushi 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.210
 the last time I can order 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.880
 somehow the other day in general I just 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.750
 namely a sushi fan can't say that 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.449
 can gobble up 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:52.310
 because of the expression 20 there is dry I do not 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.789
 eat 8 9 pieces that is one portion of me 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.250
 this is how all throat fits in 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.500
 so I am very than the advantages in all this 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.020
