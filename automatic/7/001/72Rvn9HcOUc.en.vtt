00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 we could not miss the opportunity now 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.299
 that we visited the Aztec stadium for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.490
 remember that goal I do not think he has 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.830
 been the best of your career and we're going 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 towards the goal very important will be 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 very important we were staying almost 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.730
 out of the world and well usually I 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.330
 came out and can put it exactly like 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.890
 well you say 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.420
 we could have been out of the world 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 I'm telling you because we're all Mexicans 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.080
 if this was a critical moment that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 we were losing hope for 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.559
 to go to the world cup but good as you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 I say today today we can say that we are 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 there and how good that goal was 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.809
 important to get it too 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 we are coming to the area you more or 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.649
 least we saw how I think I had not 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 recreated in what takes of the four 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.960
 months is not the first time and good more or 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.649
 less more for here 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 that area almost at the height of the post and 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:01.680
 that overflowed this one was brick in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.030
 half court the pea but it went by 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 the band a little the delay to get off and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
 well he got up his face he saw me I got 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 a strong pass to pass between 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 defenses and there maybe a bad 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.490
 reception but good I do not know the destination 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 already I wanted him kicked out by 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 there are also the repetitions and not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.429
 they let you celebrate the chicharito 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.950
 If you're so excited, all that 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.289
 euphoria you have and for the moment that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 it was lived I think that everyone is leaving the 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.970
 maximum and good until a blow take me 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 said machine so you can vacuum in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.700
 the mexico in the world now that we 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.160
 we found in the house of the selection 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.979
 good you have to think about the greatest 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.450
 get as far as possible to do the with 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.460
 that winning mentality that you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.500
 we have to win anyone to stop 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.500
 do things right over there first 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 it will be necessary to know this wait for that list 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 of 23 players this 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.050
 let's hope to be there and go to the world 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.730
 to do what is best to do what 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.650
 we know how to do each one so that all 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.380
 According to Brazil, it is not invincible 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.330
 we already talked about it and it's complicated 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.280
 is now one of the powers that is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 as always it has been but good 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.410
 we have equipment to fight him 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.690
 to give a good game and do 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 do things well to get there 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.060
 also the three points raÃºl have 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.459
 tried to hit him where I know he is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 difficult and no plays are repeated 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.560
 but where did you put it that day raÃºl 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 good but they would be before 100,000 people 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 imagine right now there is nobody but that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.000
 it's talk about the attitude also behind and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.950
 you have to dare, you have to know that the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.050
 plays present little in football 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.760
 but the moment they exceed must be 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.470
 prepared to make it the best 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.090
 way hey how do you do it to poke 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.430
 all penal also to see now 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 that we are here in the blur what is it 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.320
 what do you think as you lie as you read 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 you read lies to the doormen nothing 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120
 more is thing not to miss the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.340
 ball and sideways see the goalkeeper who 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.720
 It is always blown before before 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.540
 that passes the ball then nothing else 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 is to change the side and no longer has 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.220
 to give science has never seen you 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.819
 fail important I take 78 penalties that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.099
 It does not seem to me since I made my debut 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.469
 I have all gotten them and we hope 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.299
 continue with that streak so that for 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.980
 keep making goals 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.260
 thank you very much raÃºl we say goodbye with 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.280
 the trimming friends of thanks raul 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.090
