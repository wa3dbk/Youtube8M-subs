00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello how about I'm Cherub 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.429
 meeting right now in an ecological zone 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.620
 a farm that is about 2 km from 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.009
 our house I want you to see a little 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.750
 of what is found around here is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.750
 a beauty really 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.779
 unforgettable has a lot that I do not have 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.290
 this contact with nature out there 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.290
 It will happen 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.610
 Oh, if you can see it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.699
 yesterday that farm and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.900
 there is the opportunity to ride 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.060
 horse 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.720
 retire by a rope but I do not know 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.130
 where will that be the big milestones 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.130
 we went to the restaurant area 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 I do not tell them what they eat because 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.070
 almost did not finish it had served me 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.260
 a lot today I ate too much 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.840
 you see yourself once a week 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.270
 well here there is a lot of nature and I hope 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.610
 that you like that place today this day 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.580
 I want to share a very special topic 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.370
 about what is the voice of God how 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.650
 listen to the voice of god I do not know if any 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.900
 Once in your life you have had that doubt of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.260
 what happens if maybe you 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.580
 I'm listening to yourself or is the voice 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.510
 of God when you know the person 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 who speaks to you is easy to doubt me 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.120
 happened at the beginning when I started 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.300
 know to experience the things of my 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.150
 life but as I was knowing about him 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.479
 through his word I went 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.120
 unfolding me in that area of â€‹â€‹more 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.640
 information through books through 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.990
 of brochures through conferences 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.460
 seminars or preaching 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.160
 for me today I can tell you that thanks to 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.770
 the sentence 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.500
 to the prayer that is so 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.870
 every day we must have with that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.670
 great friend whether it's our work in 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.050
 our 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 our from our school 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.989
 in the area where we live 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.450
 whether we are young or we are adults but 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.659
 a little place to dedicate it to God in the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.790
 prayer is very important for it nothing 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.379
 more you need to be inspired and that 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.950
 we are going to practice with this great friend 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.610
 as well as if you will practice with your neighbor or 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.880
 with your school partner 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.010
 the other way is to listen through 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.020
 his word through reading the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.100
 bible or through documentaries in the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.100
 which you can know about him and meditate 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.550
 meditate on what is happening to you 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.140
 allow time he also can you 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 talk that can also be communicated 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 with you do not appear parrots speak and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.220
 talk about our life but also give it 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.390
 in him to listen to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 perceive that experience with him if you 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.820
 you spend always studying always in your 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.520
 chores you will always live a life 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.300
 with stress but if you take some time 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.150
 to be able to meditate in order to carry 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.000
 After prayer you can achieve much more 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.070
 of what you are achieving and I invite you 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.050
 to experience these forms that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.110
 I am sharing and I assure you that 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.870
 you will see excellent results 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.660
 they say you can not hear the voice nor 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 you can experience friendship with 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.200
 someone who is not known 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.050
 so you decide to know more about 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.360
 god and you can experience what you do not 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.810
 imagine these are my recommendations 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.310
 these are my you that have served me today 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.200
 I feel that sometimes I crave when 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.810
 find busy with certain 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.900
 activities of my work or of 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.030
 activities he did daily 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.519
 I feel yearning after the need to 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.660
 dedicate time to prayer because 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.210
 because it's already a habit for me then 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.150
 just as it is done to us there has been 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.400
 doing exercise makes us habit 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.180
 do other things too that we are 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.520
 make habit to be with him is everything 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.640
 that I can tell you and this view 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.210
 admirable we share it with you this 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.919
