00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
 ae 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.160
 ae 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.250
 ae 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.189
 I think it's an interesting deal 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.250
 for the fan thinks about it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.830
 the car here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.610
 are very cool and never be happy to 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.370
 be here 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.590
 cool, I think it's one is a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 approximation beyond that which is a 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.580
 different feel we are in 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.250
 stadium we are in the book in that 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.140
 climate of the game and here is one thing 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.900
 different to see the players in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.970
 one situation is that they do not return or 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.550
 So they 're playing between them. 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.510
 taking a salon make a little fun with 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.340
 ball 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.320
 I think supporter is the one who is 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.009
 in love with Sao Paulo football 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.280
 and it is a very indescribable feeling 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.280
 best 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.680
 people's book has been going on Luis 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 fabiano is a sure thing to me too 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.030
 does not show rate first time is so 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 close so the two players 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 but I do not like to talk is a 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.400
 great emotion to know has nobody 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
 playing and introducing me to this shirt 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.420
 it was nice to see the training something criticized a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.500
 bit this part of the common supporter 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 issues contact 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.850
 Also let's get it out of here. 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.500
 Do not know much about who saw you. 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.500
 who was the owner who is a bank 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.550
 I think we 're going in there and playing 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.550
 things
