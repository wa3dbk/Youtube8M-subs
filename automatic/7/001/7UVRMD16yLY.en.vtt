good beer I'm not a big fan of the real
light<00:01:58.180> beers<00:01:58.420> anyway<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.350> this<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.250> kind<00:02:00.460> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
light beers anyway so this was kind of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.749 
light beers anyway so this was kind of
an<00:02:00.610> experiment<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.680> see<00:02:02.920> if<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.400> could<00:02:03.610> do

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
an experiment just to see if I could do

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.340 
an experiment just to see if I could do
an<00:02:03.880> all<00:02:04.000> grain<00:02:04.210> lighter<00:02:04.660> beer<00:02:04.960> I've<00:02:05.170> never

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.540 
done a light beer actually all grain now
that<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:08.470> about<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> lightest<00:02:09.399> has

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
that I think about it the lightest has

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.150 
that I think about it the lightest has
been<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:09.940> ESB<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.870> know<00:02:13.990> Amber's<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.070> know

I've never tried a light all green so
this<00:02:29.890> would<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> first<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.580> I'd<00:02:30.670> say<00:02:30.820> you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
this would be the first and I'd say you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.650 
this would be the first and I'd say you
turned<00:02:31.239> up<00:02:31.360> pretty<00:02:31.600> darn<00:02:31.780> good<00:02:33.660> definitely

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
turned up pretty darn good definitely

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.259 
turned up pretty darn good definitely
not<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> beer<00:02:35.080> style<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> typically<00:02:35.950> have

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
not a beer style that I typically have

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.990 
not a beer style that I typically have
have<00:02:37.269> on<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:39.310> those<00:02:39.459> lasing

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
have on that with that for those lasing

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:53.880 
have on that with that for those lasing
fanatics<00:02:43.230> dish

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.030 

yeah<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> think<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.060> lighten<00:02:55.420> up<00:02:55.570> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
yeah I think I just lighten up the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.710 
yeah I think I just lighten up the
biscuit<00:02:57.040> well<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.550> -<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.120> mean<00:02:58.240> like<00:02:58.450> let's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
biscuit well just a - I mean like let's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.950 
biscuit well just a - I mean like let's
see<00:02:58.840> we<00:02:58.930> put<00:02:58.960> in<00:02:59.260> was<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> half<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.920> pound<00:03:00.130> I

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
see we put in was a half a pound I

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.820 
see we put in was a half a pound I
probably<00:03:01.960> do<00:03:02.350> like<00:03:02.620> point<00:03:02.980> four<00:03:03.630> pounds

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
probably do like point four pounds

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.050 
probably do like point four pounds
rather<00:03:05.830> than<00:03:06.100> point<00:03:06.370> five

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
rather than point five

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.140 
rather than point five
I<00:03:07.770> said<00:03:08.770> just<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.010> couple<00:03:09.280> ounces<00:03:09.370> less<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.940> think

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
I said just a couple ounces less I think

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.590 
I said just a couple ounces less I think
I<00:03:10.390> think<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.200> may<00:03:11.290> smooth<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.770> out<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.920> bit

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
I think it may smooth it out a bit

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.510 
I think it may smooth it out a bit
better<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.320> kind<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.740> round<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.040> out<00:03:15.130> um

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
better you know kind of round it out um

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.830 
better you know kind of round it out um
I<00:03:15.660> did

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
I did

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.330 
I did
there<00:03:17.410> are<00:03:17.470> several<00:03:17.590> recipes<00:03:17.980> I've<00:03:18.100> seen<00:03:18.250> they

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
there are several recipes I've seen they

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.210 
there are several recipes I've seen they
use<00:03:18.520> like<00:03:18.640> corn<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.709> didn't<00:03:20.920> want<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.130> do

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
use like corn and I didn't want to do

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.650 
use like corn and I didn't want to do
that<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.490> this<00:03:21.580> one<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.950> barley<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.940> hops

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
that with this one just barley and hops

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.600 
that with this one just barley and hops
actually<00:03:26.650> yeah<00:03:26.830> that's<00:03:27.100> because<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.459> would

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
actually yeah that's because this would

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.000 
actually yeah that's because this would
be<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.100> barley<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.610> hops<00:03:31.770> yeast<00:03:32.770> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
be just the barley the hops yeast and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.580 
be just the barley the hops yeast and
water<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.900> technically<00:03:34.900> abided<00:03:35.410> by<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
water so technically abided by the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.000 
water so technically abided by the
German<00:03:36.040> beer<00:03:36.160> Purity<00:03:36.220> law<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.970> time<00:03:37.650> sweet

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
German beer Purity law this time sweet

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.750 
German beer Purity law this time sweet
I<00:03:39.959> guess<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.140> pH<00:03:41.440> stabilizer<00:03:42.040> count<00:03:42.520> against

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
I guess this pH stabilizer count against

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.350 
I guess this pH stabilizer count against
that<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.120> don't<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:44.760> I'm<00:03:45.760> really<00:03:46.090> not<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
that I don't know I'm really not that

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.850 
that I don't know I'm really not that
even<00:03:46.600> when<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.780> comes<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.020> my<00:03:47.170> brewing<00:03:47.500> end<00:03:47.680> up
