00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
was gonna say and thought but then I

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.310 
was gonna say and thought but then I
remembered<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.120> story<00:05:16.420> is<00:05:16.510> in<00:05:16.750> Florida

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
remembered that this story is in Florida

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.260 
remembered that this story is in Florida
and<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:18.220> you're<00:05:18.310> talking<00:05:18.610> about<00:05:18.760> Florida

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
and when you're talking about Florida

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.210 
and when you're talking about Florida
every<00:05:19.540> weird<00:05:19.840> story<00:05:20.320> that<00:05:20.620> like<00:05:20.800> probably

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
every weird story that like probably

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.590 
every weird story that like probably
ninety<00:05:21.760> five<00:05:21.910> percent<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.390> ones<00:05:22.540> that

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
ninety five percent of the ones that

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.240 
ninety five percent of the ones that
make<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.900> on<00:05:22.990> happy<00:05:23.290> hour<00:05:23.320> all<00:05:23.710> happen<00:05:24.190> in

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
make it on happy hour all happen in

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.920 
make it on happy hour all happen in
Florida<00:05:24.670> so<00:05:25.000> I<00:05:25.030> actually<00:05:25.270> think<00:05:25.570> they<00:05:25.720> have<00:05:25.900> a

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
Florida so I actually think they have a

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.660 
Florida so I actually think they have a
fair<00:05:26.320> argument<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:27.070> they<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.520> know<00:05:27.550> they

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
fair argument that they you know they

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.310 
fair argument that they you know they
can't<00:05:28.030> take<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.270> upon<00:05:28.510> themselves<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:29.020> discern

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
can't take it upon themselves to discern

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.770 
can't take it upon themselves to discern
