of the nose and we're going to put a

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:25.430 
of the nose and we're going to put a
line<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:18.230> where<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> eye<00:00:19.350> goes<00:00:24.110> comes<00:00:25.110> down

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
line here where the eye goes comes down

line here where the eye goes comes down
the<00:00:26.010> tear<00:00:26.279> duct<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> shorter<00:00:27.300> line<00:00:27.710> trailing

off the end is a bigger line a little

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.099 
off the end is a bigger line a little
bit<00:00:31.650> more<00:00:32.309> room<00:00:32.820> under<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> outside

eye<00:01:43.980> eye<00:01:44.370> lids<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.150> more<00:01:46.130> okay<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
eye eye lids a little bit more okay so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.780 
eye eye lids a little bit more okay so
you<00:01:48.030> starting<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.300> look<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.480> something<00:01:48.720> now

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
you starting to look like something now

you starting to look like something now
we'll<00:01:50.790> also<00:01:50.970> add<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:52.760> texture

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
we'll also add a little bit of texture

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.360 
we'll also add a little bit of texture
inside<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.650> couple<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.950> lines<00:01:56.159> here

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
inside just a couple of lines here

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.969 
inside just a couple of lines here
that's<00:01:56.760> are<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> little<00:01:57.330> bit<00:01:57.510> darker<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's are a little bit darker for the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.170 
that's are a little bit darker for the
iris<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> now<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.300> lightly<00:02:01.760> color<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:03.000> in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
iris and now will lightly color that in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.540 
iris and now will lightly color that in
I<00:02:03.420> say<00:02:04.260> color<00:02:04.500> abyss<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.950> course<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.370> black

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
I say color abyss of course it's black

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.580 
I say color abyss of course it's black
and<00:02:05.729> white<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> tone<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.290> color

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and white but I think of tone as color

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
what kind of using it like color now

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.239 
what kind of using it like color now
I'll<00:02:09.810> take<00:02:09.959> an<00:02:10.079> eraser<00:02:10.499> and<00:02:10.649> lighten<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.069> just

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.249 
I'll take an eraser and lighten it just

I'll take an eraser and lighten it just
touch<00:02:11.840> as

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
touch as

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.880 
touch as
as<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.480> kind<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.780> glowy<00:02:14.080> look<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.650> now

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
as a kind of a glowy look to it and now

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.150 
as a kind of a glowy look to it and now
the<00:02:17.950> top<00:02:18.550> we're<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.920> attach<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.100> a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the top we're going to attach with a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.950 
the top we're going to attach with a
shadow<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> shine<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.540> pupil<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
shadow to the shine and the pupil and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.750 
shadow to the shine and the pupil and
the<00:02:23.080> reason<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:24.220> here

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the reason is because over here

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.040 
the reason is because over here
see<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:26.370> eyelid<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.640> casts<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.300> shadow<00:02:28.330> from

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
see this eyelid it casts a shadow from

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.720 
see this eyelid it casts a shadow from
overhead<00:02:29.470> light<00:02:29.740> if<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.310> overhead

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
overhead light if you have overhead

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.200 
overhead light if you have overhead
lighting<00:02:31.860> it'll<00:02:32.860> cast<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.190> shadow<00:02:33.220> down<00:02:33.760> here

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
lighting it'll cast a shadow down here

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.270 
lighting it'll cast a shadow down here
and<00:02:34.390> that's<00:02:34.900> important<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.070> gives<00:02:36.130> it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and that's important because it gives it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.370 
and that's important because it gives it
depth<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.210> much<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.900> add<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> little

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
depth so much so that you add a little

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.410 
depth so much so that you add a little
bit<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.710> shading<00:02:38.980> light<00:02:39.640> shading<00:02:39.970> very<00:02:40.240> light

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
bit of shading light shading very light

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.990 
bit of shading light shading very light
shading<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> eyeball<00:02:41.200> itself<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.850> we're

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
shading on the eyeball itself now we're

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.180 
shading on the eyeball itself now we're
going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.300> sort<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.810> gradate<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.410> down<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.070> it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
going to sort of gradate this down so it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.040 
going to sort of gradate this down so it
doesn't<00:02:45.490> just<00:02:45.520> suddenly<00:02:45.880> start<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.990> very

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
doesn't just suddenly start to be very

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.660 
doesn't just suddenly start to be very
light<00:02:47.500> gray<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.460> kind<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:48.850> blend<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
light gray so we kind of blend it in and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.100 
light gray so we kind of blend it in and
now<00:02:51.970> we're<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.330> thicken<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.840> lower<00:02:53.020> eye

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
now we're going to thicken the lower eye

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.070 
now we're going to thicken the lower eye
I<00:02:53.470> live<00:02:53.800> here<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:55.740> some<00:02:56.740> more<00:02:57.000> darkness<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.390> a

I live here and some more darkness and a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.590 
I live here and some more darkness and a
little<00:02:59.410> bit<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.850> shading<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.090> here<00:03:01.390> because

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
little bit more shading in here because

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.880 
little bit more shading in here because
this<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.080> sort<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.380> pocket<00:03:02.860> under<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.220> eye

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
this is sort of a pocket under the eye

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.000 
this is sort of a pocket under the eye
