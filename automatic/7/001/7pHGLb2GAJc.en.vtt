yeah<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.740> rockets<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> space<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
yeah because rockets go to space so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
yeah because rockets go to space so
that's<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> vehicle<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.950> space<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.549> a
