and<00:01:13.229> ergonomics<00:01:13.350> design<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.509> ergonomics<00:01:15.720> are

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
and ergonomics design and ergonomics are

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
and ergonomics design and ergonomics are
exactly<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.939> same<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:19.020> Odyssey

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

exactly the same as the other Odyssey
models<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> very<00:01:21.810> bad<00:01:22.530> news<00:01:23.220> even

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
models and this is a very bad news even

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.920 
models and this is a very bad news even
worse<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.900> X<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.590> even<00:01:26.130> heavier<00:01:26.430> hence<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
worse the X is even heavier hence it is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.620 
worse the X is even heavier hence it is
a<00:01:28.080> pain<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.829> use<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.790> more<00:01:30.000> than<00:01:30.060> 30

is they are so easy to drive that you

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.930 
is they are so easy to drive that you
don't<00:05:46.860> need<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.370> dedicated<00:05:47.700> amp<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:49.230> move<00:05:49.440> them

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940

formats such mp3 files therefore you

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.570 
formats such mp3 files therefore you
won't<00:05:58.500> need<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:59.070> dedicated<00:05:59.910> DAC<00:06:00.360> as<00:06:00.690> well<00:06:01.580> you
