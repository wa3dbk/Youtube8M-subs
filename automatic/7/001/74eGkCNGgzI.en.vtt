00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hi, my loves, how are you? I'm here today. 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.799
 To talk about ticks 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.910
 I got these extensions here for 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.679
 review in vp fashion store already included 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 it's not right 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 one on the side the way I like it and I 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
 I'll show you how I apply it. 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 far away for you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 the color it came from a yellow like that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 It tastes good. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.849
 I fainted at that, as the judge 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.050
 my mark and it was that tone here that I 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.149
 taste 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 So we do not mess with you when 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.760
 I do not pick up these parties in the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.250
 my leather hair does not look good 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.789
 I was afraid to use ticks then 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.510
 leaves an event suddenly and plum drops 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.739
 In my hair, I know but it's super safe. 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.020
 putting it the way I'm going to explain the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 You have no error yet. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.360
 existing to check star 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.399
 I like it here and on the scalp 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.399
 we came back two more droplets 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.240
 tic-tac printer do this with the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240
 others 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.640
 Presses people do not need to stay 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.159
 perfect only that it will stay inside the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.979
 Hair no one will see even this 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.939
 the color difference of my hair from my 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.229
 dark root with color what darkened the 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.970
 TIC Tac 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.570
 so it stays inside just goes 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.270
 to highlight a kiss on the beads in the hair 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.009
 I have is that three meters so I 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.520
 I have to give a space so that the three 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.140
 wicks can get in here in my hair 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 huh 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.450
 thomas does not have to be perfect 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.100
 our division here from ear to ear and 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:03.640
 I'm going to add another piece like the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:07.240
 another part to position it and do this 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.350
 circular movement fits the leather 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.630
 hairy 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.720
 make movements are two droplets that the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.190
 from the other 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 in the last two strands that I go 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.410
 put four pieces 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.910
 I have to put it nearer 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.940
 possible 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.480
 the distance between them so that when 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.709
 move your head up here at the top to 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 that does not look like the most 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.890
 crazy that the olÃ© queen then I am I 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:53.000
 I'll apply the last stain for 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.049
 here people table space 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.450
 the last time i put the space is 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.200
 very close because you can not stay here 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.049
 on top think why when it comes to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.579
 head will be appearing at maximum 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.250
 that can arrive 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.569
 are three fingers f1 manor it then I 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.760
 I think how much more or less this here. 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.890
 three fingers 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.400
 people will put latest style sun 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 with four pieces always 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.629
 positioning and placing in one by one 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.450
 if I move here looks will be appearing 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.690
 I put to use that here it goes 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.909
 appear as I go, call me head 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.379
 so come so it is of course 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.409
 that the extension 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.930
 She has rolled my hair straight and I go 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.109
 even all that I like to use it 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.810
 one side the curl so I'll do 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.510
 babyliss in my whole hair along with 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.269
 chances to strengthen these curls 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.069
 were made of glass more or less here 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.410
 very light 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.410
 You say dots even though I'm going to mess around. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.670
 I'll 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.019
 my hair is super extension 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.310
 natural after the sun or you applied 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.789
 football coach of something like that 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.199
 It's okay, then, to be different for you. 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:28.259
 some details then people I will do 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.630
 This is how you see my hair. 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.930
 dark because underneath she was crazy 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.780
 dark then when I do box 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.370
 he joins the dark effect she moves 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.750
 trade is much easier too. 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.900
 nice too 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.419
 he looks pretty good when it comes to separating 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.759
 You have to have some care without 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.490
 make very sudden movements so as not to 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.030
 even though he's stuck 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:59.400
 if you pull it comes it's the baby I'm 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:03.840
 people are using this one is the Connell is 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.940
 will co s is something I've done a video 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.820
 showing you how I do what 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.740
 I find the hair with this drink here. 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.080
 Whoever wants to watch, I'll leave the link. 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.330
 for you here the information on the blog 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.270
 also that he sees himself has more details 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.919
 how do I make tips on how to roll the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.009
 hair last longer 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.080
 here is basically about the utility 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.630
 were at least as mobile as they are 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.400
 doing all the hair and showing you 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.280
 in the end 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.289
 so folks I finished my hair all over 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.909
 I'll show you. 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:43.349
 It is quite natural not to volume the face 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.580
 a move like this gets a chance weight 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.389
 hair right 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.539
 and I like to use it this way I do not like 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.370
 to use and smooth with the extension because 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.900
 It's a difference for more than my 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.050
 hair is practically the same 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.370
 size that the extension I use the most to 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.280
 the average volume does not stay legal 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.860
 I like it angled because I can 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.560
 lighter messes with the other daughter 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.360
 supernatural table pretty cool 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.360
 my hair was cut into layers 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.550
 It's a call and you pick it up 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.600
 so I make the curls so much 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.190
 Natural 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.130
 so we hope they liked it 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.030
 and services purchased as apply to the 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.820
 tic tac 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.610
 I'll make another video of how 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.700
 choose your screens to how they are going to 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.120
 To hire, I 'll ask two questions. 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.130
 more frequent about the team, I'm going 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.630
 questions about tic tac in 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.030
 another video for the one that was not much 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.919
 great is good then people a great 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.800
 Kiss, everybody gave a pass. 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.200
