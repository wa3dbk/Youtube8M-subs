00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
description box below first you're going

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.630 
description box below first you're going
to<00:01:15.829> take<00:01:16.070> your<00:01:16.340> shoe<00:01:16.640> box<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.240> cut<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.640> using

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
to take your shoe box and cut it using

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.510 
to take your shoe box and cut it using

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.030 

okay<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.510> what<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.900> box<00:01:32.110> should<00:01:32.890> look

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
okay so this is what the box should look

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.550 
okay so this is what the box should look
like<00:01:33.070> but<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.790> should<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.150> flat<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.750> basically

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
like but it should be flat and basically

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.650 
like but it should be flat and basically
this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.920> going<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.190> give<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.550> flat<00:01:36.970> area<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
this is going to give you a flat area to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.740 
this is going to give you a flat area to
cut<00:01:37.840> out<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.140> pieces<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.150> next<00:01:40.480> you're<00:01:40.600> going

cut out the pieces so next you're going
to<00:01:40.840> create<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.380> templates<00:01:45.870> okay<00:01:46.870> so<00:01:47.320> you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
to create the templates okay so you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.320 
to create the templates okay so you
should<00:01:47.890> have<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> base<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:49.590> back<00:01:50.590> wall<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.370> two

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
should have a base a back wall and two

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.050 
should have a base a back wall and two
side<00:01:52.690> pieces<00:01:53.850> next<00:01:54.850> what<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.150> want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.420> do<00:01:55.660> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
side pieces next what you want to do is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.570 
side pieces next what you want to do is
take<00:01:58.060> your<00:01:58.240> box<00:01:59.250> lay<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.430> flat<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:03.130> begin

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.780 
up and reinforce these by gluing them to
these<00:02:22.480> sections<00:02:23.470> let's<00:02:24.010> go<00:02:24.250> ahead<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.640> just

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
these sections let's go ahead and just

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.720 
these sections let's go ahead and just
start<00:02:25.060> gluing<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.650> glue<00:02:26.860> these<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.550> use<00:02:27.580> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
start gluing to glue these you can use a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.870 
start gluing to glue these you can use a
hot<00:02:28.060> glue<00:02:28.090> gun<00:02:28.330> or<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.410> glue<00:02:29.980> stick<00:02:30.010> because

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
hot glue gun or a glue stick because

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.380
