the game first thing you want to do is
select<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.390> mode<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.309> actually<00:00:32.430> just

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
play offline or go online or actually

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360

load<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> saved<00:00:37.140> game<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> nice<00:00:38.070> because

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
load a saved game which is nice because

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.220 
load a saved game which is nice because
you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.790> save<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> state<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> game<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you can save the state of the game and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
you can save the state of the game and
then<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.129> interrupted<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.879> come

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
then if you get interrupted you can come

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
then if you get interrupted you can come
back

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
back

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
back
ascension<00:00:44.280> doesn't<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.760> long<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.030> play

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
ascension doesn't take that long to play

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810 
ascension doesn't take that long to play
so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.930> don't<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.039> that'll<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.610> useful

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so I don't think that'll be that useful

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.560 
so I don't think that'll be that useful
for<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.350> could<00:00:49.530> happen<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
for this but it could happen and the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.639 
for this but it could happen and the
different<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> couple<00:00:52.289> different

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
different there's a couple different

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
different there's a couple different

if you click on help it'll open the
vassal<00:01:17.130> manual<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> PDF<00:01:18.180> document<00:01:18.680> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
vassal manual it's a PDF document and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
vassal manual it's a PDF document and
it'll<00:01:20.009> tell<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.700> different<00:01:20.790> ways<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it'll tell you all the different ways to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.969 
it'll tell you all the different ways to
do<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.220> straightforward<00:01:23.610> so

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
do it it's pretty straightforward so

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.749 
do it it's pretty straightforward so
typically<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.130> people<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
typically I think people will just

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.429 
typically I think people will just
connect<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> vassal<00:01:27.630> server<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> tell

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
connect to the vassal server and tell

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
connect to the vassal server and tell
their<00:01:28.590> buddy<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.009> connect<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.630> way

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
their buddy to connect in them the way

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.980 
their buddy to connect in them the way
they<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:31.280> will<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.820> offline<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> show<00:01:33.840> us

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
they go will do offline just to show us

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.999 
they go will do offline just to show us
everything<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> pick<00:01:36.530> 2<00:01:37.530> 3<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.799> 4

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
everything so you can pick 2 3 or 4

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.210 
everything so you can pick 2 3 or 4
player<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.759> doesn't<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.210> matter<00:01:40.220> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
player this doesn't really matter you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
player this doesn't really matter you
can<00:01:41.340> actually<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.759> pick<00:01:41.939> 4<00:01:42.210> player<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.940 
can actually just pick 4 player and
it'll<00:01:42.840> set<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.439> number<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> Honor

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it'll set up the right number of Honor

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.530 
it'll set up the right number of Honor
tokens<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> wanted<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.060> sort<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.450> an

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
tokens if you wanted to have sort of an

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
tokens if you wanted to have sort of an
extended<00:01:45.930> two-player<00:01:46.799> game<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.310> something

extended two-player game or something

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
extended two-player game or something
and<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.210> does<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.770> configure

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and all this really does is configure

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
and all this really does is configure
the<00:01:49.860> number<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.189> our<00:01:50.369> honor<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.240> I'll<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.420> that

players here you'd see their little

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.330 
players here you'd see their little
folders<00:05:49.230> for<00:05:49.440> them<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.890> can<00:05:50.040> see<00:05:50.220> how

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
folders for them and you can see how

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.280 
folders for them and you can see how
many<00:05:50.520> total<00:05:50.970> points<00:05:51.300> they<00:05:51.390> have<00:05:51.420> here<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.140> and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
many total points they have here and and

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.010 
many total points they have here and and
the<00:05:53.130> number<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.490> tokens<00:05:53.700> so<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.240> can<00:05:54.480> see<00:05:54.720> you

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
the number of tokens so you can see you

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.920 
the number of tokens so you can see you
know<00:05:55.140> each<00:05:56.010> who's<00:05:56.370> piling<00:05:56.970> up<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.120> tokens<00:05:57.690> so

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
know each who's piling up the tokens so

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.200 
know each who's piling up the tokens so
to<00:05:57.990> speak<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:59.430> know<00:05:59.550> you<00:05:59.610> need<00:05:59.850> to<00:05:59.880> start

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
preventing that if you can't okay so you

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.830 
preventing that if you can't okay so you
can<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:05.850> couple<00:06:05.880> things<00:06:06.270> here<00:06:06.390> let's<00:06:06.690> say<00:06:06.810> I

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
can and a couple things here let's say I

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.020 
can and a couple things here let's say I
drew<00:06:07.050> all<00:06:07.200> these<00:06:07.320> cards<00:06:07.740> out<00:06:07.920> and<00:06:08.250> okay<00:06:08.730> I'm

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
drew all these cards out and okay I'm

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.210 
drew all these cards out and okay I'm
done<00:06:09.240> I'm<00:06:09.570> gonna<00:06:09.750> just<00:06:10.200> right<00:06:10.740> click<00:06:10.980> this

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
done I'm gonna just right click this

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.670 
done I'm gonna just right click this
we're<00:06:11.550> total<00:06:11.880> cards<00:06:12.120> of<00:06:12.210> your<00:06:12.330> deck<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.990> then

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
we're total cards of your deck and then

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.110 
we're total cards of your deck and then
you<00:06:13.770> can<00:06:13.890> shuffle<00:06:14.100> in<00:06:14.280> a<00:06:14.340> few<00:06:14.520> times<00:06:14.760> so<00:06:15.000> that

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
you can shuffle in a few times so that

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.880 
you can shuffle in a few times so that
makes<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.480> pretty<00:06:15.600> easy<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.860> know

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
makes it pretty easy to you know

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.850 
makes it pretty easy to you know
reshuffle<00:06:17.820> your<00:06:17.940> discard<00:06:18.390> into<00:06:18.810> your<00:06:19.590> draw

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
reshuffle your discard into your draw

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.670 
reshuffle your discard into your draw
pile<00:06:21.890> a<00:06:23.480> couple<00:06:24.480> other<00:06:24.630> things<00:06:24.660> so<00:06:25.320> this<00:06:25.440> is<00:06:25.500> a

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
pile a couple other things so this is a

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.700 
pile a couple other things so this is a
little<00:06:25.890> pass<00:06:26.070> button<00:06:27.050> so<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:28.410> can<00:06:28.440> Mouse

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
little pass button so you can Mouse

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.370 
little pass button so you can Mouse
passes<00:06:29.160> their<00:06:29.340> turn<00:06:31.190> and<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:33.150> last<00:06:33.570> thing<00:06:33.960> is

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
passes their turn and the last thing is

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.280 
passes their turn and the last thing is
constructs<00:06:35.310> so<00:06:35.820> kind<00:06:36.600> of<00:06:36.690> played<00:06:36.960> around<00:06:37.169> a

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
constructs so kind of played around a

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.700 
constructs so kind of played around a
little<00:06:37.320> bit<00:06:37.560> where<00:06:37.950> to<00:06:38.040> stick<00:06:38.370> these<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:38.940> not

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
little bit where to stick these and not

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.610 
little bit where to stick these and not
have<00:06:40.039> it<00:06:40.190> completely<00:06:40.580> confusing<00:06:41.449> so<00:06:42.350> you<00:06:42.410> can

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
have it completely confusing so you can

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.469 
have it completely confusing so you can
if<00:06:42.740> you<00:06:42.830> hide<00:06:43.009> your<00:06:43.190> hand<00:06:43.490> there<00:06:43.789> you<00:06:43.820> can<00:06:44.180> see

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
if you hide your hand there you can see

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.870 
if you hide your hand there you can see
we<00:06:44.930> have<00:06:45.050> these<00:06:45.169> four<00:06:45.560> rows<00:06:45.830> of<00:06:45.880> contracts

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
we have these four rows of contracts

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.360 
we have these four rows of contracts
square<00:06:47.150> one<00:06:47.300> two<00:06:47.449> three<00:06:47.660> four<00:06:47.979> so<00:06:48.979> if<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:49.130> put

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
square one two three four so if I put

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.060 
square one two three four so if I put
these<00:06:49.520> over<00:06:49.580> here<00:06:50.289> you<00:06:51.289> know<00:06:51.410> I<00:06:51.440> can<00:06:51.560> see<00:06:51.830> okay

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
these over here you know I can see okay

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.850 
these over here you know I can see okay
this<00:06:52.100> is<00:06:52.370> my<00:06:52.550> row<00:06:52.820> and<00:06:53.120> you<00:06:53.750> know<00:06:53.870> my<00:06:54.530> buddy's

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
this is my row and you know my buddy's

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.529 
this is my row and you know my buddy's
gonna<00:06:55.009> player<00:06:55.250> two<00:06:55.520> and<00:06:55.550> so<00:06:56.000> we<00:06:56.120> can<00:06:56.270> see<00:06:56.389> who's

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
gonna player two and so we can see who's

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:57.999 
gonna player two and so we can see who's
got<00:06:56.720> how<00:06:56.900> many<00:06:56.960> contracts<00:06:57.620> and<00:06:57.770> it<00:06:57.830> kind<00:06:57.979> of

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
got how many contracts and it kind of

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.279 
got how many contracts and it kind of
goes<00:06:58.160> off<00:06:58.340> a<00:06:58.370> little<00:06:58.580> bit<00:06:58.820> here<00:06:59.000> I<00:06:59.210> have<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.229> a

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
goes off a little bit here I have that a

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.680 
goes off a little bit here I have that a
few<00:07:00.560> games<00:07:00.770> where<00:07:01.130> we<00:07:02.120> get<00:07:02.300> like<00:07:02.479> eight

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
few games where we get like eight

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.999 
few games where we get like eight
constructs<00:07:03.139> out<00:07:03.380> but<00:07:03.560> that's<00:07:03.710> pretty<00:07:03.860> rare

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009 
constructs out but that's pretty rare

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.740 
constructs out but that's pretty rare
and<00:07:04.340> usually<00:07:04.460> somebody<00:07:04.940> gets<00:07:05.090> a<00:07:05.210> tiring<00:07:05.479> out

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
and usually somebody gets a tiring out

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.010 
and usually somebody gets a tiring out
and<00:07:06.160> clears<00:07:07.160> up<00:07:07.370> after<00:07:07.880> one<00:07:08.060> turn<00:07:08.419> so<00:07:08.840> that

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
and clears up after one turn so that

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.640 
and clears up after one turn so that
should<00:07:09.229> be<00:07:09.350> enough<00:07:09.590> room<00:07:09.889> I<00:07:10.039> think<00:07:11.470> one<00:07:12.470> thing

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
should be enough room I think one thing

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.830 
should be enough room I think one thing
to<00:07:12.710> keep<00:07:12.919> in<00:07:13.070> mind<00:07:13.130> though<00:07:13.610> is<00:07:13.970> when<00:07:14.720> the

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
to keep in mind though is when the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.379 
to keep in mind though is when the
game's<00:07:15.050> over<00:07:15.229> you<00:07:15.470> want<00:07:15.650> to<00:07:15.740> count<00:07:15.949> everything

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
game's over you want to count everything

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.700 
game's over you want to count everything
just<00:07:17.389> move<00:07:17.660> your<00:07:17.780> constructs<00:07:18.229> into<00:07:18.500> there

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
just move your constructs into there

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.300 
just move your constructs into there
because<00:07:18.770> it<00:07:19.009> doesn't

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
because it doesn't

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.159 
because it doesn't
inally<00:07:19.669> count<00:07:19.940> stuff<00:07:20.210> that's<00:07:20.479> either<00:07:20.660> on<00:07:20.960> your

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
inally count stuff that's either on your

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.770
