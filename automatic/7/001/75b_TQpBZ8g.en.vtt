and again these are frozen but I let it
thaw<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.420> cup

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

cup of coconut water

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.140 
cup of coconut water
now<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.500> abstraction<00:01:44.160> blade<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.880> so

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
now this abstraction blade is so

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.390 
now this abstraction blade is so
different<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.380> nutribullets

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
different from the other nutribullets

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.740 
different from the other nutribullets
you<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.210> squeeze<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.510> then<00:01:51.510> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you just squeeze this on and then you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.350 
you just squeeze this on and then you
just<00:01:51.990> put<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> base<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.340> drop<00:01:54.300> it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.960 

so<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.660> actually<00:02:01.320> shuts<00:02:01.830> off<00:02:02.130> automatically

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
so this actually shuts off automatically

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.620 
so this actually shuts off automatically
after<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.540> minute<00:02:04.280> which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.880> freakin<00:02:06.420> cool

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
after a minute which is so freakin cool

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.350 
after a minute which is so freakin cool
to<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.930> honest<00:02:07.260> with<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.760> smooth

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to be honest with you this is so smooth

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.840 
to be honest with you this is so smooth
and<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.380> definitely<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> juice

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and it's definitely more of the juice

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.120
