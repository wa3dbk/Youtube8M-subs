 hello friends that such sure that some of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 you have not dared to ever do 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 cupcakes at home thinking they are very 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 difficult because you'll see how not here in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 the kitchen of alimerka all the recipes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 they are very simple we are going to make some 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 orange cupcakes with chocolate that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
 they are delicious we are going to see a little 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 the ingredients we need 150 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.210
 grams of butter at temperature 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.050
 environment 150 grams of sugar 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 a pair of eggs size l 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 150 grams of flour 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 a teaspoon of chemical yeast in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 powder one tablespoon approximately 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.859
 brandy and then to make the cream of 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.770
 chocolate we are going to use a tub 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:56.870
 of cream cheese 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.790
 a terrine of cream cheese with chocolate 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.360
 and a little bit of cocoa powder 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.520
 the fine graining of two oranges a 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.840
 little bit of sugar to vanilla and a 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.430
 little sugar glas about two 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.440
 spoonfuls 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.150
 The first thing we are going to do is beat the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.410
 butter with sugar and let's 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.530
 do it with the help of the rods 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.400
 electric 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.400
 yes 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 Well, we have the list ready 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 butter with sugar and let's 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.409
 now add the eggs always 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.229
 we add one by one so that the dough 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.159
 do not cut us and if you have them 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.470
 room temperature is always a lot 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 better because for the same thing because if 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.890
 the dough is very cold from the fridge 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.890
 can be cut we beat a little bit 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.039
 and now we throw the other egg and the same 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 and now we will add zest 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.070
 the Orange 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.080
 and the splash of brandy to flavor 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.080
 the dough and we beat another little 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.870
 and now we are finally going to sift the 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.100
 flour with the yeast on top of the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 mixture 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.130
 as always with the colander you go a little 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.130
 little by sifting 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.300
 we beat a little bit with the blender the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.530
 flour with the butter mixture nothing 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.530
 so that it integrates justly 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 Well, we have our mass ready, let's go 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.090
 now to pass it to the papers of law 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.099
 muffin 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.160
 you can help with a spoonful of 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.980
 ice cream to make it faster 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.930
 and more comfortable 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.390
 and so we assure you that you put the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.750
 same amount of mass in each in each 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.750
 little paper 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
 we already have our cupcakes ready in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.910
 the pieces of paper and now we are going to bake 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 the 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.850
 we are going to have them for about 15-20 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.730
 minutes at 180 degrees you will know when 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.110
 you are ready , you are going to see that the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.120
 cupcake has grown a little and 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.040
 pressing with the index finger on the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.750
 center of the cake cap you can see if it is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.830
 ready he has to be a little firm but 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.830
 not too hard 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.340
 while we have the cupcakes cooling 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.099
 we can go taking advantage to do the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.110
 cream let's just beat all 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.370
 the ingredients in the bowl we throw the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.190
 cream cheese chocolate cream cheese 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.230
 i 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.780
 a spoonful more or less of sugar to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.180
 vanilla and cocoa powder and sugar 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.190
 We are going to sift what we want 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 the cream is going to be thinner 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.630
 a spoonful of cocoa powder over here 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.300
 and icing sugar about two tablespoons is 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.420
 enough 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.420
 i 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.050
 and now with the electric rods 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.919
 we beat until everything is creamy 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.919
 ok and well mixed 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.160
 we already have our cupcakes cold 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 that we can decorate with cream 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.630
 for this I have here a pastry bag 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.790
 with a shape star nozzle 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.590
 open I'm going to help from a glass 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.630
 because that's how it's cleaner to throw the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.800
 cream without staining so much then nothing 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.879
 we passed the cream 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.879
 here to the manga 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.059
 we close the sleeve 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:05.629
 let's give it a few taps so that 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.629
 leave all the air 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.190
 and to decorate them we are going to make a 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.130
 species of roses that are very nice 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.810
 you have to take the sleeve completely 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.360
 perpendicular to the cupcake and we're going to 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.160
 start at the center and the movement is 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.080
 go spiraling little by little 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.470
 a little from the center to the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.470
 periphery 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.570
 then we have to always try 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.529
 tighten evenly so you do not 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.360
 we get creamed cream 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:43.099
 and when we get to the end 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.099
 we throw upwards 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.320
 i 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.320
 all right 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.370
 and I'm giving the final touch to the 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.840
 cupcakes I prepared some decorations very 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.450
 simple things you can do at home 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.910
 putting the text that you most want 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.680
 with a stick it is very easy 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.210
 and as you saw these recipes very 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.590
 simple but that you try it and that you 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.450
 like it a lot and you know that you can 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.250
 find this and many more in the kitchen 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.670
 Alimerka dotcom see you soon 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.670
 bye
