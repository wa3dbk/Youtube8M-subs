00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the materials that we are going to use go 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.890
 to be our transparent bases are 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.429
 the color of your want to be the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.429
 tweezers 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.110
 and transparent nylon 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.769
 with glue on the contact 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.060
 your accounts your experiences with which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060
 want to decorate 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.290
 besides shakira I am using 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 Beating with the palms are red and gray 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.820
 in addition also our drill 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.880
 let's start then the first thing that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 let's do is we're going to cut 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.560
 our video pastes 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 and we are going to cut a few days 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.720
 I already have some imported pines 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.530
 and these strips have two centimeters of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.890
 wide by 20 centimeters long for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 make a sphere need three strips 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.909
 with these three strips that I have here 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.340
 well then once I have my three 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.720
 already cut strips I'll grab one of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.410
 strips 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.410
 I will deliver 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.980
 and now we are that everyone according to the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.730
 strip 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.730
 and I do 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 it is a lie 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 plant at the tip 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.340
 lewis t 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
 there 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.980
 and it stays this way is not with my 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.160
 figure already swells and get into strip the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.160
 I'm putting well through 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 crusade 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 without crossing 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.690
 equally worthwhile 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.490
 Once I have already formed, it waits for me 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.590
 Now I'm going to make the holes with the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.240
 drill 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.490
 what I am going to say is that no 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.490
 I'm going to mark a point in the center 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.470
 both on the top 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.470
 as the bottom part 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.829
 installed 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.829
 and now 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.280
 and now I do the same part here 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.060
 above 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.060
 all my drill 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 yes 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.730
 once I have my holes already 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.000
 in the part here below a part of 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.000
 up here 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.210
 I'm going to insert 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.720
 they live there 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.720
 here I already have what is silver 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.870
 and with the tweezers 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.030
 I'm going to crush her 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.030
 so that we do not miss the times 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.560
 since crushed 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 and that prevents me from leaving the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.689
 stones and good and tail with stone 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.790
 that I put time inside my felitta 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:34.190
 so I can focus on being subject 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.370
 there the center the only thing I'm going to do 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.080
 is that I'm going to put crazy tail to her 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.030
 dry because the stones are already 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.030
 was in the center now 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.810
 inserted a thousand stones it will go up 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.360
 also to close I will put a 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.449
 staple but here we are going to take advantage of 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.240
 once to make him these waves for 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.600
 hang it then what I'm going to do is 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.570
 that here I already have inserted 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.630
 what is the grass here is tip of what 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.960
 that is the nylon thread I will return 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.020
 to pass 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.600
 by the gravel has this form and so of 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.610
 this form I have left the little eye 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.220
 and then I am left spherical jam if they see 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.949
 what easy then what are we going to 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.690
 do to be able to hit what is the 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.300
 beating the scissors is that we're going to 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.820
 use the same tea and double was detected 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.440
 now transparent 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.440
 I'm going to focus on 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.449
 I'm going to paste 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.120
 and already stuck if this take double 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.680
 has a centimeter wide and if 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.810
 record before our strip has two 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.310
 centimeters then and now I'm 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.310
 getting in treaty 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.419
 and they are technical standards 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.370
 yes 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.390
 you have to I'm going to decorate this case 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.880
 this is pearl color 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.880
 these circuits that are color litmus 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.840
 I could 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.720
 as if it were a thigh 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.970
 and in form what is a side and what 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.610
 let's do to decorate those 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.160
 holes that still remain without us 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.099
 decorate is that in this case then 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.610
 use it even as red and the only thing 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.610
 what we give 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.700
 finch 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.550
 automatically 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:13.440
 plus 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.440
 yes 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:22.630
 they are pressure so that you want what 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.630
 and half stuck stick 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.630
 completely 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.139
 and so it is 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.440
 after the world of news 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.140
 well then I have decorated the 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.420
 sides I already put this ignoble speech 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.940
 of more strips that are needed for 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.849
 decorate it 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.069
 here is a 

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:59.479
 all'll do different than 

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:59.479
 they are decorated the same 

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.590
 lie 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.650
 to the wreck canteen and machine
