00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.230
 This is the HP Slate 10 HD. It is a.. 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.379
 10 inch Android tablet, pretty .. 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.910
 average in design and it weighs 630 grams. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 I am here to tell you something more about it. Let's start with to ... 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.109
 to go outside. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.359
 You would think that this is a decent standard tablet .. 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.009
 and I agree, but what is striking is that it is built-in for free .. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.100
 Has 3G, so it is suitable for internet on the go .. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 so you don't have to pay for extra data. If you have it, just turn it on, 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.720
 log in to the provider's website, enter your details. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.309
 and you have 250 free megabytes of data. 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.409
 per month. The subscription ends after 2 years, 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.980
 but that is still pretty beneficial and you can take an extension .. 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.359
 if you want to use more than the permitted data. 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.339
 The HP Slate 10 sounds a lot better than the average tablet .. 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.649
 and that is because HP has partnered with Beats Audio .. 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.470
 who made the speakers. The only drawback is that HP has decided to install the speakers .. 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.539
 to place at the bottom. That means the sound if you hold it like that ... 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.170
 is sometimes muted. The third point of attention .. 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 from this tablet .. 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.979
 is the screen. That has a resolution of 1280 x 800. 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.179
 So although it may look sharp and clear, sometimes you will notice that if you go to .. 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.819
 a webpage goes .. 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.490
 or viewing text and zooming in, the edges of the text are really blurred .. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 and become frayed. The HP Slate 10 costs .. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 Â£ 249. I don't think that's bad when you consider that you .. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.340
 Get a 3G connection for free. All in all he is pretty .. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 standard in terms of screen resolution .. 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.979
 and also the design. You can choose between red .. 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.990
 or silver on the back and the housing is plastic. So pretty standard .. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 for a tablet. But.. 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 the generous subscription is absolutely striking.
