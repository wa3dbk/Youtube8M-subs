00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.379 
you normally do find a CD of some kind
even<00:02:57.720> though<00:02:58.670> they<00:02:59.670> haven't<00:02:59.850> got<00:03:00.030> any<00:03:00.150> optical

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
even though they haven't got any optical

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.890 
even though they haven't got any optical
drives<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.400> here's<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.790> main<00:03:03.540> bit<00:03:03.780> that

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
drives but here's the main bit that

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.559 
drives but here's the main bit that
we're<00:03:04.019> looking<00:03:04.260> at<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.700> toshiba<00:03:06.180> NB<00:03:06.500> 200

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
we're looking at here the toshiba NB 200

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.129 
we're looking at here the toshiba NB 200
just<00:03:09.569> take<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.139> off<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.720> looks<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
just take that off it looks like the

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.629 
just take that off it looks like the
batteries<00:03:13.530> already<00:03:13.680> attached<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.459> and

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
batteries already attached on this and

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.930 
batteries already attached on this and
all<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:16.190> attach<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.430> separately

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
all we have to attach that separately

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.060 
all we have to attach that separately
afterwards

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:33.590 

so<00:03:30.170> here<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.290> are<00:03:31.940> obviously<00:03:32.940> has<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.240> cover<00:03:33.450> on

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
so here we are obviously has a cover on

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.160 
so here we are obviously has a cover on
it<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:35.540> let's<00:03:36.540> take<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> look<00:03:39.990> at<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it and let's take have a look at the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.730 
it and let's take have a look at the
side<00:03:40.410> set<00:03:40.710> open<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:44.600> take<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> sleeve<00:03:46.020> off

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.690 

protective<00:03:49.740> sleeve<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.360> go<00:03:51.450> it's

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
protective sleeve so there you go it's

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.130 
protective sleeve so there you go it's
glossy<00:03:53.700> display<00:03:54.000> as<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.840> from<00:03:54.990> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
glossy display as you can see from the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.960 
glossy display as you can see from the
top<00:03:55.350> there<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.400> can<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.120> very<00:03:57.300> small<00:03:58.970> web

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
top there you can see a very small web

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.410 
top there you can see a very small web
camera<00:04:01.130> they're<00:04:02.130> quite<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> small<00:04:02.760> one<00:04:03.150> and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
camera they're quite a small one and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660 
camera they're quite a small one and
probably<00:04:03.840> looks<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.380> digital<00:04:05.190> Mike<00:04:05.370> next

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
probably looks like a digital Mike next

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.080 
probably looks like a digital Mike next

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.700 
can see the battery in the back there
and<00:05:13.620> how<00:05:13.830> much<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.160> sticks<00:05:14.400> out<00:05:15.530> doesn't<00:05:16.530> bulge

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
and how much it sticks out doesn't bulge

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.350 
and how much it sticks out doesn't bulge
too<00:05:17.010> much<00:05:17.190> out<00:05:17.340> from<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.670> bottom<00:05:17.790> actually<00:05:18.330> I

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
too much out from the bottom actually I

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.680 
too much out from the bottom actually I
mean<00:05:18.540> you<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.750> see<00:05:18.990> there<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:21.330> know<00:05:21.450> it

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
mean you can see there you know it

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.180 
mean you can see there you know it
doesn't<00:05:21.810> stick<00:05:22.170> out<00:05:22.320> too<00:05:22.530> much<00:05:22.770> but<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.070> does

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
doesn't stick out too much but it does

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.220 
doesn't stick out too much but it does
obviously<00:05:23.550> that's<00:05:24.300> compromised<00:05:24.870> when<00:05:25.110> you're

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
obviously that's compromised when you're

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.850 
obviously that's compromised when you're
looking<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.530> from<00:05:25.740> from<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.670> back<00:05:26.850> there<00:05:27.860> if

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
looking it from from the back there if

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.550 
looking it from from the back there if
we<00:05:28.920> just<00:05:29.400> have<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.850> look<00:05:30.030> at<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.240> back<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.840> think

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
we just have a look at the back I think

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.350 
we just have a look at the back I think
she<00:05:31.800> babe<00:05:32.010> have<00:05:32.250> done<00:05:32.430> quite<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.700> good<00:05:32.910> job<00:05:33.120> eggs

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
she babe have done quite a good job eggs

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.909 
she babe have done quite a good job eggs
you've<00:05:33.540> obviously<00:05:33.630> access<00:05:34.169> panels<00:05:34.560> for<00:05:34.680> most

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
you've obviously access panels for most

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.060 
you've obviously access panels for most
things<00:05:36.110> you're<00:05:37.110> looking<00:05:37.410> at

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
things you're looking at

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.760 
things you're looking at
you<00:05:38.220> can<00:05:38.370> see<00:05:38.580> two<00:05:39.030> separate<00:05:39.480> slaughter<00:05:39.770> one

in that book choice you can see the the
brown<00:06:30.810> finish<00:06:31.350> on<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:32.310> front<00:06:32.550> here<00:06:32.790> it's

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
brown finish on the front here it's

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.800 
brown finish on the front here it's
actually<00:06:33.710> kind<00:06:34.710> of<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.890> ribbed<00:06:35.640> finishes<00:06:36.450> it's

actually kind of a ribbed finishes it's
all<00:06:36.930> mat<00:06:37.260> so<00:06:37.560> you're<00:06:37.590> not<00:06:37.920> likely<00:06:38.160> to<00:06:38.310> get<00:06:38.520> you

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
all mat so you're not likely to get you

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.610 
all mat so you're not likely to get you
know<00:06:38.910> many<00:06:39.090> finger<00:06:39.420> prick<00:06:39.600> mark<00:06:39.810> top<00:06:40.080> marks<00:06:40.350> on

it<00:06:40.970> it's<00:06:41.970> probably<00:06:42.060> not<00:06:42.330> to<00:06:42.450> everyone's<00:06:42.810> taste

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
it it's probably not to everyone's taste

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.020 
it it's probably not to everyone's taste
the<00:06:43.320> particular<00:06:43.590> color<00:06:44.010> but<00:06:44.280> you<00:06:44.790> know<00:06:44.910> we
