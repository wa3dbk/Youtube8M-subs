this<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.810> what<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.199> making<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:03.950> double

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
this is what we're making a double

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.480 
this is what we're making a double
twisted<00:00:06.649> bangle<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:10.769> square<00:00:11.190> wired

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
twisted bangle that the square wired

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.410 
twisted bangle that the square wired
isn't<00:00:12.090> twisted<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.370> piece<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
isn't twisted at all on one piece and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.269 
isn't twisted at all on one piece and
it's<00:00:15.630> twisted<00:00:16.139> really<00:00:16.410> tightly<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> other

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it's twisted really tightly on the other

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.840 
it's twisted really tightly on the other
piece<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:19.020> easy<00:00:19.289> when<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:22.850> we're

going to do a simple left and right
twist<00:00:26.609> bangle<00:00:27.710> for<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:30.449> for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
twist bangle for this you need well for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.889 
twist bangle for this you need well for
this<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:31.820> two<00:00:32.820> millimeter<00:00:33.390> square

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this one I'm using two millimeter square

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.080 
this one I'm using two millimeter square
wire<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.649> piece<00:00:39.200> 600<00:00:40.200> mil<00:00:40.440> long<00:00:40.760> two<00:00:41.760> feet

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
wire and a piece 600 mil long two feet

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.549 
wire and a piece 600 mil long two feet
in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> old<00:00:42.899> money<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:45.050> make<00:00:46.050> sure<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
in the old money and make sure it's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.130 
in the old money and make sure it's
annealed<00:00:49.910> if<00:00:50.910> you're<00:00:51.210> ordering<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.840> from

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
annealed if you're ordering this from

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.299 
annealed if you're ordering this from
your<00:00:52.350> supplier<00:00:52.800> order<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> dead<00:00:54.180> soft<00:00:55.309> you'll

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
your supplier order it dead soft you'll

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
your supplier order it dead soft you'll
still<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> anneal<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> again<00:00:57.870> before

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
still have to anneal it again before

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.119 
still have to anneal it again before
we're<00:00:58.980> finished<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.960> saves<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
we're finished but it saves time in the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
we're finished but it saves time in the
beginning<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.270> putting<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.979> sharpie

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
beginning so I'm just putting a sharpie

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.690 
beginning so I'm just putting a sharpie
mark<00:01:09.560> halfway<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> grab<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
mark halfway and I'm going to grab it in

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.679 
mark halfway and I'm going to grab it in
my<00:01:15.710> GRS<00:01:16.710> vise

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.270 

now<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.799> GRS

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
now the GRS

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.480 
now the GRS
vise<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.740> really<00:01:25.740> good<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.460> doesn't

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
vise is really good because it doesn't

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
vise is really good because it doesn't
have<00:01:26.939> any<00:01:26.970> teeth<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> mark<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> metal<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
have any teeth to mark the metal so you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
have any teeth to mark the metal so you
don't<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> put<00:01:31.320> masking<00:01:32.040> tape<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
don't have to put masking tape on the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.499 
don't have to put masking tape on the
jaws<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:34.040> copper<00:01:35.040> jaw<00:01:35.610> covers<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
jaws or copper jaw covers or any of that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.620 
jaws or copper jaw covers or any of that
stuff<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.140> great<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> way<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.630> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stuff it's great just the way it is so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.310 
stuff it's great just the way it is so
now<00:01:39.840> we're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:41.689> our<00:01:42.689> self<00:01:43.049> locking

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
now we're going to take our self locking

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
now we're going to take our self locking
pliers<00:01:43.770> vise<00:01:44.640> grips<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.850> make<00:01:48.329> sure<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> get

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780

grabbing<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> smallest<00:03:01.080> amount

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
grabbing it at the smallest amount

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.410 
grabbing it at the smallest amount
because<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.010> don't<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.850> change<00:03:03.300> my

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
because I don't want to change my

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.210 
because I don't want to change my
pattern<00:03:04.020> here<00:03:04.400> yeah<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.330> now<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.890> side

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
pattern here yeah so now on this side

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.480 
pattern here yeah so now on this side
what<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> want<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.570> twist<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
what I want to do is twist it to the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:27.970 
what I want to do is twist it to the
left<00:03:14.240> one<00:03:15.739> two<00:03:17.510> three<00:03:19.130> four<00:03:22.280> six<00:03:23.280> turns<00:03:24.030> yeah

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.979 

now<00:03:28.980> we're<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.459> grab<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.570> our<00:03:30.600> mark

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
now we're going to grab it at our mark

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.100 
now we're going to grab it at our mark
in<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.260> middle<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.709> we're<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.870> bend<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
in the middle and we're going to bend it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.490 
in the middle and we're going to bend it
I'm<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.370> using<00:03:35.610> chain<00:03:36.300> nose<00:03:36.540> pliers<00:03:36.900> pointed

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
I'm just using chain nose pliers pointed

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
I'm just using chain nose pliers pointed
nose<00:03:37.680> pliers<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:39.660> we're<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.080> bend<00:03:40.380> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
nose pliers and we're going to bend it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.590 
nose pliers and we're going to bend it
so<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.100> fairly<00:03:41.580> tight<00:03:41.850> like<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.330> and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
so that it's fairly tight like this and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.560 
so that it's fairly tight like this and
we're<00:03:42.750> going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.019> put<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.940> back<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.180> our<00:03:45.360> vise

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
we're going to put that back in our vise

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.360 
we're going to put that back in our vise
at<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.590> bend<00:03:48.290> now<00:03:49.290> we're<00:03:49.470> going<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.739> grab<00:03:50.160> this

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
at the bend now we're going to grab this

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.220 
at the bend now we're going to grab this
end<00:03:50.640> again<00:03:50.970> with<00:03:51.390> our<00:03:52.220> self<00:03:53.220> locking<00:03:53.519> pliers

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.840 

and<00:03:58.230> we're<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.830> twist<00:03:59.070> it<00:04:01.489> enough<00:04:02.489> turns

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
and we're going to twist it enough turns

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.050 
and we're going to twist it enough turns
to<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.330> right<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.650> side<00:04:05.070> unwinds

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
to the right that this side unwinds

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.480 
to the right that this side unwinds
itself<00:04:06.860> one<00:04:08.390> two<00:04:10.549> three

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
itself one two three

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.760 
itself one two three
for<00:04:14.430> five<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.840> now<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.110> can<00:04:20.410> see<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
for five so now you can see the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.060 
for five so now you can see the
reasoning<00:04:21.280> behind<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.440> what<00:04:23.650> we<00:04:23.830> have

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
reasoning behind this so what we have

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.880 
reasoning behind this so what we have
now<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.270> piece<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.230> square<00:04:26.590> wire<00:04:28.890> going

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
now is a piece of square wire going

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.190 
now is a piece of square wire going
through<00:04:30.220> our<00:04:30.490> twisted<00:04:31.090> wire<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.900> square

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
through our twisted wire and the square

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050 
through our twisted wire and the square
wire<00:04:32.410> doesn't<00:04:32.710> look<00:04:32.980> like<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.430> whist<00:04:33.730> it<00:04:33.910> at

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
wire doesn't look like it's whist it at

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.640 
wire doesn't look like it's whist it at
all

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
all

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.580 
all
so<00:04:35.650> that's<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.130> trick<00:04:36.660> now<00:04:37.660> because<00:04:38.290> all<00:04:38.440> of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
so that's the trick now because all of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.380 
so that's the trick now because all of
this<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.890> work<00:04:39.130> hardened<00:04:39.580> from<00:04:39.730> our<00:04:39.940> twisting

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
this is work hardened from our twisting

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.370 
this is work hardened from our twisting
we<00:04:40.540> need<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.900> anneal<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.850> cut<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.150> length

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
we need to anneal it cut it to length

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.270 
we need to anneal it cut it to length
which<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.860> our<00:04:46.680> bangle<00:04:47.680> size<00:04:47.950> this<00:04:48.220> is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
which will be our bangle size this is

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.270 
which will be our bangle size this is
going<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.730> be<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> bangle<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.680> it'll<00:04:50.920> be<00:04:51.070> the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
going to be a bangle so it'll be the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.740 
going to be a bangle so it'll be the
diameter<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:55.360> bangle<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.140> this<00:04:57.750> you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
diameter of the bangle and this you

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.580 
diameter of the bangle and this you
would<00:04:59.260> think<00:04:59.470> would<00:04:59.740> be<00:04:59.920> 4<00:05:00.280> mil<00:05:02.910> yeah<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.020> it's

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
would think would be 4 mil yeah so it's

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.220 
would think would be 4 mil yeah so it's
actually<00:05:05.940> 4.5<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.750> we'll<00:05:07.900> have<00:05:08.050> our

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
actually 4.5 but so we'll have our

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.350 
actually 4.5 but so we'll have our
diameter<00:05:08.560> plus<00:05:09.190> 4<00:05:09.580> mil<00:05:09.990> times<00:05:10.990> 3.14<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.670> that

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
diameter plus 4 mil times 3.14 and that

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.380 
diameter plus 4 mil times 3.14 and that
will<00:05:13.570> give<00:05:13.810> us<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.170> exact<00:05:14.500> length<00:05:14.770> now

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
will give us the exact length now

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.440 
will give us the exact length now
ideally<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.250> twisted<00:05:18.730> wire<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
ideally the twisted wire and the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.740 
ideally the twisted wire and the
straight<00:05:19.810> wire<00:05:20.700> will<00:05:21.700> end<00:05:21.910> up<00:05:22.090> perfectly

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
straight wire will end up perfectly

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.410 
straight wire will end up perfectly
fitting<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.560> ends<00:05:23.830> together<00:05:24.040> so<00:05:24.610> try<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.000> do

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
fitting the ends together so try to do

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.560 
fitting the ends together so try to do
that<00:05:25.450> get<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.050> as<00:05:26.200> close<00:05:26.500> as<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.860> can<00:05:27.570> because

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
that get it as close as you can because

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.910 
that get it as close as you can because
you're<00:05:28.900> not<00:05:29.020> going<00:05:29.230> to<00:05:29.290> be<00:05:29.440> able<00:05:29.590> to<00:05:29.710> hammer

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
you're not going to be able to hammer

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.690 
you're not going to be able to hammer
this<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.430> stretch<00:05:30.670> it<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:33.780> cut<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.110> length

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
this to stretch it so cut it to length

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.600 
this to stretch it so cut it to length
anneal<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.380> we'll<00:05:38.560> form<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:39.460> and

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
anneal it and and we'll form it and

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.260 
anneal it and and we'll form it and
solder<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:41.010> now<00:05:42.010> get<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.340> ends<00:05:42.610> lined<00:05:42.880> up<00:05:43.090> as

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
solder it now get the ends lined up as

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.940 
solder it now get the ends lined up as
good<00:05:43.780> as<00:05:43.840> possible

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
good as possible

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.340 
good as possible
this<00:05:45.400> is<00:05:45.610> reasonably<00:05:46.300> close<00:05:46.660> I<00:05:46.930> need<00:05:47.140> to

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
this is reasonably close I need to

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.030 
this is reasonably close I need to
pickle<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.070> now<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:49.350> we'll<00:05:50.350> tidy<00:05:50.710> this<00:05:50.980> up

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
pickle it now and we'll tidy this up

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.130 
pickle it now and we'll tidy this up
with<00:05:51.400> an<00:05:51.520> abrasive<00:05:51.790> wheel<00:05:52.240> try<00:05:52.570> to<00:05:52.630> blend<00:05:52.930> it

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
with an abrasive wheel try to blend it

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.370 
with an abrasive wheel try to blend it
together<00:05:53.350> so<00:05:54.100> it's<00:05:54.250> invisible<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:55.380> then

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
together so it's invisible and then

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.000 
together so it's invisible and then
we'll<00:05:57.000> round<00:05:58.000> it<00:05:58.210> up<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:58.870> polish<00:05:59.320> it<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.890> when

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
we'll round it up and polish it so when

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.070 
we'll round it up and polish it so when
you<00:06:03.160> get<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.460> joins<00:06:03.760> tidied<00:06:04.540> up<00:06:04.660> to<00:06:04.900> your

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
you get the joins tidied up to your

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.180 
you get the joins tidied up to your
satisfaction

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.400 

either<00:06:09.240> polish<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.420> on<00:06:10.570> the<00:06:10.720> polishing<00:06:11.200> wheel

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
either polish it on the polishing wheel

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.250 
either polish it on the polishing wheel
or<00:06:11.710> stick<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.130> in<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.400> tumbler<00:06:12.780> Hall<00:06:13.780> market

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
or stick it in the tumbler Hall market

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.210 
or stick it in the tumbler Hall market
and<00:06:14.770> that's<00:06:15.730> it<00:06:15.970> and<00:06:16.390> this<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.080> what<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:17.740> wanted

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
and that's it and this is what I wanted

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.570 
and that's it and this is what I wanted
to<00:06:18.370> accomplish<00:06:19.560> twisted<00:06:20.560> wire<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.130> by

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
to accomplish twisted wire and by

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.580 
to accomplish twisted wire and by
twisting<00:06:22.060> it<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.479> right

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
twisting it to the right

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.900 
twisting it to the right
and<00:06:25.900> twisting<00:06:26.900> my<00:06:27.110> square<00:06:27.860> wire<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.520> the<00:06:28.639> left

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
and twisting my square wire to the left

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.990 
and twisting my square wire to the left
I<00:06:29.500> untwisted<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:30.620> as<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.010> twisted<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.550> two<00:06:31.730> and

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
I untwisted it as I twisted the two and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.960 
I untwisted it as I twisted the two and
I<00:06:32.090> continued<00:06:32.750> twisting<00:06:33.290> this<00:06:34.010> to<00:06:34.639> the<00:06:34.790> right

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
I continued twisting this to the right

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.550 
I continued twisting this to the right
so<00:06:35.900> I<00:06:35.930> actually<00:06:36.320> got<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:36.830> look<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.190> wanted
