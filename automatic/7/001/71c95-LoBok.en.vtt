00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.379 
water and UV radiation now my next step
was<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.499> find<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.770> binding<00:01:33.130> agent<00:01:33.249> I<00:01:33.639> tried

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
was to find a binding agent I tried

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.629 
was to find a binding agent I tried
several<00:01:34.719> different<00:01:35.200> products<00:01:35.529> and<00:01:35.709> concluded

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
several different products and concluded

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.339 
several different products and concluded
that<00:01:36.670> soo-mack<00:01:37.029> would<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.689> best<00:01:37.899> binding

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
that soo-mack would be the best binding

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.219 
that soo-mack would be the best binding
agent<00:01:38.999> so<00:01:39.999> I<00:01:40.029> created<00:01:40.420> my<00:01:40.509> photocatalytic

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
agent so I created my photocatalytic

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.739 
agent so I created my photocatalytic
composite<00:01:41.859> with<00:01:42.279> cement<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.729> sand<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.119> added

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
composite with cement and sand and added

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.749 
composite with cement and sand and added
water<00:01:43.959> which<00:01:44.319> resulted<00:01:44.829> in<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.069> reaction<00:01:45.579> known

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759

however<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.079> was<00:01:50.169> too<00:01:50.349> heavy<00:01:50.969> then<00:01:51.969> I<00:01:51.999> came

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
however it was too heavy then I came

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.059

so<00:02:25.810> when<00:02:25.960> UV<00:02:26.260> radiation<00:02:26.860> strikes<00:02:27.220> my

so when UV radiation strikes my

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.250 
so when UV radiation strikes my
composite<00:02:27.970> electrons<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.990> holes<00:02:29.170> are

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
composite electrons and holes are

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.710 
composite electrons and holes are
created<00:02:29.850> these<00:02:30.850> electrons<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.540> holes

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
created these electrons and holes

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
created these electrons and holes
combined<00:02:32.140> with<00:02:32.320> oxygen<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.890> water<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.490> create

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
combined with oxygen and water to create

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.510 
combined with oxygen and water to create

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
super oxides and hydroxyl radicals now

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.220 
super oxides and hydroxyl radicals now
these<00:02:36.730> reactive<00:02:37.270> species<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.990> oxidize

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
these reactive species can oxidize

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.820 
these reactive species can oxidize
organics<00:02:39.070> into<00:02:39.400> water<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.910> carbon<00:02:40.210> dioxide

so<00:02:41.830> how<00:02:41.980> does<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.220> kill<00:02:42.460> bacteria

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
so how does this kill bacteria

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.540 
so how does this kill bacteria
well<00:02:44.080> when<00:02:44.200> UV<00:02:44.500> radiation<00:02:45.040> strikes<00:02:45.340> a

primitive<00:02:46.360> game<00:02:46.660> forms<00:02:47.350> on<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.740> thymine<00:02:48.250> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
primitive game forms on the thymine and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.580 
primitive game forms on the thymine and
cytosine<00:02:48.700> bases<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> DNA<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:50.170> harmful

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.100 
cytosine bases in the DNA of harmful
pathogens<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.970> prevents<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.540> DNA<00:02:52.930> from

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
pathogens this prevents the DNA from

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.170 
pathogens this prevents the DNA from
replicating<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.920> eventually<00:02:54.520> destroys<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
replicating and eventually destroys the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.820 
replicating and eventually destroys the
pathogen<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> built<00:02:59.080> several<00:02:59.380> different
