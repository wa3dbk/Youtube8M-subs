was a fire cap or like a fire rate cap

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.590 
was a fire cap or like a fire rate cap
on<00:03:15.870> guns<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.950> black<00:03:17.160> ops<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.120> wasn't

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
on guns and black ops so that it wasn't

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.590 
on guns and black ops so that it wasn't
as<00:03:18.840> easy<00:03:19.709> for<00:03:20.130> modded<00:03:20.850> controllers<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.420> there

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
as easy for modded controllers if there

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.360 
as easy for modded controllers if there
were<00:03:21.810> people<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.320> were<00:03:22.380> modding<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.040> wasn't

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
were people that were modding it wasn't

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.970 
were people that were modding it wasn't
as<00:03:23.489> noticeable<00:03:23.970> because<00:03:24.840> then<00:03:25.440> their<00:03:25.709> gun

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
as noticeable because then their gun

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.680 
as noticeable because then their gun
would<00:03:26.190> lock<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.670> after<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.060> certain<00:03:27.299> point<00:03:27.540> if

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
would lock up after a certain point if

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.020 
would lock up after a certain point if
they<00:03:27.810> were<00:03:27.870> shooting<00:03:28.110> too<00:03:28.500> fast<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.790> mean

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
they were shooting too fast so I mean

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.509 
they were shooting too fast so I mean
it's<00:03:30.720> definitely<00:03:31.019> something<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.130> black

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
it's definitely something that in black

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.100 
it's definitely something that in black
ops<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.910> wasn't<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.239> noticeable<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> mean

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
ops it wasn't as noticeable but I mean

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.770
