now<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:05.200> regards<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> Constitution<00:02:06.670> class

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
now as regards the Constitution class

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.120 
now as regards the Constitution class
starship<00:02:07.360> which<00:02:07.689> is<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.960> Constitution<00:02:08.860> we

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
starship which is the Constitution we

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.839 
starship which is the Constitution we
fit<00:02:09.459> actually<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.830> has<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> little<00:02:12.489> bit<00:02:12.670> better

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
fit actually it has a little bit better

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.280 
fit actually it has a little bit better
whole<00:02:13.209> integrity

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
whole integrity

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.720 
whole integrity
so<00:02:16.129> as<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.450> has<00:02:17.599> turned<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.049> me

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
so as you can see it has turned to me

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.059 
so as you can see it has turned to me
a little<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.209> rain<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.989> lot<00:02:21.170> more<00:02:21.379> range<00:02:21.620> for

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
a little more rain a lot more range for

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.339 
a little more rain a lot more range for
phaser<00:02:22.700> firing<00:02:23.120> capability<00:02:23.360> than<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:23.989> index

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
phaser firing capability than the index

you<00:03:25.930> strategy<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.960> like<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.230> do<00:03:27.350> is<00:03:27.500> leave<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
you strategy I like to do is leave the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.350 
you strategy I like to do is leave the
boat<00:03:27.980> ship<00:03:28.280> behind<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.790> take<00:03:28.940> care<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
boat ship behind and take care of the

boat ship behind and take care of the
birds<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.750> prey<00:03:29.780> first

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.880 

so<00:03:34.420> they<00:03:34.540> won't<00:03:34.659> have<00:03:34.840> her<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.290> efforts<00:03:35.680> you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
so they won't have her my efforts you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.460 
so they won't have her my efforts you
know

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.580 

and<00:03:40.060> sometimes<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.150> can<00:03:41.240> be<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> bit<00:03:42.020> difficult

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
and sometimes it can be a bit difficult

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.510 
and sometimes it can be a bit difficult
to<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:43.360> done<00:03:44.360> sir<00:03:44.690> torpedo<00:03:45.020> fire<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.250> not

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
to a done sir torpedo fire but it's not

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.610 
to a done sir torpedo fire but it's not
that<00:03:46.730> hard<00:03:46.970> so

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.339 

yeah<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:53.209> continue<00:03:53.629> on<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.900> this

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
yeah just continue on like this

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:02.550 
yeah just continue on like this
collecting<00:03:54.860> beacons<00:03:55.819> as<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.090> go<00:03:56.239> along

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.660 

pretty<00:04:03.220> simple<00:04:03.580> really

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

let's<00:04:09.670> see<00:04:10.080> about<00:04:11.080> oh<00:04:11.320> yeah<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.800> Klingons

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
let's see about oh yeah the Klingons

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.210 
let's see about oh yeah the Klingons
Klingons<00:04:13.690> obviously<00:04:14.230> have<00:04:14.410> cooling<00:04:14.950> devices

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
Klingons obviously have cooling devices

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.970 
Klingons obviously have cooling devices
when<00:04:15.520> you<00:04:15.640> render<00:04:15.880> their<00:04:16.120> ships<00:04:16.360> invisible<00:04:17.109> of

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
when you render their ships invisible of

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.530 
when you render their ships invisible of
course<00:04:18.220> as<00:04:18.370> they<00:04:18.489> start<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:18.820> close<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.329> can

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
course as they start to close you can

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.360 
course as they start to close you can
target<00:04:20.170> them<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.930> might<00:04:23.860> shooter<00:04:24.190> down

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
target them and just might shooter down

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.460 
target them and just might shooter down
with<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> phaser<00:04:24.910> fire<00:04:25.420> or<00:04:25.690> tornado<00:04:26.200> or<00:04:26.440> two

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
with a phaser fire or tornado or two

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.420 
with a phaser fire or tornado or two
before<00:04:27.070> they<00:04:27.210> completely<00:04:28.560> yeah<00:04:29.590> cloak<00:04:29.980> ships

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
before they completely yeah cloak ships

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.990 
before they completely yeah cloak ships
are<00:04:31.470> ps2<00:04:32.470> kind<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.800> fine<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:33.460> once<00:04:33.820> they

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
are ps2 kind of fine but once they

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.610 
are ps2 kind of fine but once they
decode<00:04:34.480> they're<00:04:34.780> really<00:04:35.110> not<00:04:35.320> much<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
decode they're really not much of a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.850 
decode they're really not much of a
problem<00:04:36.150> now<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.630> birds<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.140> prey<00:04:38.170> like<00:04:38.620> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
problem now the birds of prey like the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.800 
problem now the birds of prey like the
city<00:04:39.100> fair<00:04:39.370> their<00:04:39.670> whole<00:04:39.910> integrity<00:04:40.420> is<00:04:40.540> not

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
city fair their whole integrity is not

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.129 
city fair their whole integrity is not
exactly<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.440> strongest

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
exactly the strongest

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.399 
exactly the strongest
so<00:04:44.289> yeah<00:04:45.460> d7<00:04:46.150> on<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.509> other<00:04:46.659> hand

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
so yeah d7 on the other hand

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.619 
so yeah d7 on the other hand
as<00:04:48.529> much<00:04:48.860> stronger<00:04:49.189> old<00:04:49.519> Lincoln<00:04:50.119> surprising

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
as much stronger old Lincoln surprising

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.119 
as much stronger old Lincoln surprising
way<00:04:50.809> of<00:04:50.959> it<00:04:52.569> and<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.719> port<00:04:53.959> shock<00:04:54.259> loser<00:04:54.830> has

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
way of it and the port shock loser has

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.650 
way of it and the port shock loser has
the<00:04:55.459> most<00:04:56.080> durable<00:04:57.080> away

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
the most durable away

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.900 
the most durable away
or<00:04:59.170> shielding<00:04:59.680> or<00:04:59.830> whatever

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.960 

Okin<00:05:04.660> ship<00:05:04.960> has<00:05:05.230> decent<00:05:05.590> ceiling<00:05:06.340> though<00:05:06.640> term

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
Okin ship has decent ceiling though term

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.430 
Okin ship has decent ceiling though term
here<00:05:07.150> we'll<00:05:07.300> take<00:05:07.510> out<00:05:07.630> one<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.840> its<00:05:07.960> shield

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
here we'll take out one of its shield

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.959 
here we'll take out one of its shield
grids<00:05:08.920> in<00:05:09.250> one<00:05:09.490> shot

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
grids in one shot

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.810 
grids in one shot
as<00:05:12.159> phasors<00:05:13.159> has

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.570 

yeah<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.360> definitely<00:05:16.480> has

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.540 

you<00:05:20.789> want<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.150> keep<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.599> Vulcan<00:05:22.289> ships<00:05:22.620> energy

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
you want to keep the Vulcan ships energy

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.969 
you want to keep the Vulcan ships energy
levels<00:05:23.819> from<00:05:23.909> getting<00:05:24.180> too<00:05:24.300> low<00:05:24.710> because<00:05:25.710> if

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
levels from getting too low because if

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.820 
levels from getting too low because if
it<00:05:26.099> gets<00:05:26.159> too<00:05:26.310> low<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.139> Leon<00:05:28.139> gets<00:05:28.409> a<00:05:28.500> torpedo

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
it gets too low and Leon gets a torpedo
