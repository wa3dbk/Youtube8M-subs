00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

what<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.780> have<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.650> growing<00:00:02.010> number<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
what we have is a growing number of

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.999 
what we have is a growing number of
circuits<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.510> so<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> question<00:00:04.470> becomes<00:00:04.770> for

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
circuits and so the question becomes for

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.909 
circuits and so the question becomes for
a<00:00:05.040> city<00:00:05.310> like<00:00:05.460> Mumbai<00:00:05.970> what<00:00:06.839> are<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.379> multiple

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
a city like Mumbai what are the multiple

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.540 
a city like Mumbai what are the multiple
servants<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.179> city<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.990> located

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
servants in which that city is located

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.890 
servants in which that city is located
in<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.179> they're<00:00:12.630> probably<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.610> 78<00:00:14.870> for<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
in and they're probably on 78 for a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.859 
in and they're probably on 78 for a
similar<00:00:16.430> any<00:00:17.430> during<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.510> also<00:00:18.660> he

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
similar any during that one also he

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689 
similar any during that one also he
needs<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> understand<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> other

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
needs to understand what are the other

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.480 
needs to understand what are the other
cities<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.720> each<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> circuits<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.070> are

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
cities on each of the circuits that are

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
cities on each of the circuits that are

one<00:01:18.930> quick<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.220> putting<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.149> is<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.899> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
one quick way of putting it is that the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.440 
one quick way of putting it is that the
global<00:01:23.250> city<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> place<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.290> inequality

global city is a place where inequality

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
global city is a place where inequality
grows<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.070> share<00:01:29.340> some

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
