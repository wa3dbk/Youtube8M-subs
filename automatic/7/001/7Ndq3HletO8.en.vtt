00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.580
 ah 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.590
 hello good afternoon everyone how they are am 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.500
 hector arellano belloch and we are in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.190
 monticello more code here in new york 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.100
 in the presentation of the new series 7 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.100
 We have 25 innovations in this new 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.680
 vehicle 13 of which are exclusive 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.190
 in series 7 in the segment in which 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.650
 is every bank now we have it in the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.500
 which is on the top of the list each bank 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.309
 what really helps us do is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.800
 have a much lighter vehicle and more 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.060
 rigid at the same time this allows us to be 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 obviously much more agile 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.410
 dynamically speaking in the vehicle 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.070
 have two personalities you can have 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.470
 all the comfort of what our 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.620
 customers can wait already when they are 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 as passengers but they are listening 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.150
 around here obviously also has 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.440
 that personality of audio good 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 performance is something that has that 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.400
 interesting feature we have for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.610
 first time traction at four 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.980
 available wheels with address 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780
 integral this will allow us then 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.140
 obviously having that great again 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 management ability of the others 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.790
 issues that we can see in the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.910
 vehicle are events for example this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 double line that we have on the side of the 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.979
 vehicle that character line connects 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.590
 the part of the headlights with the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 headlights here on this side we have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 the rearview mirror that is the mirror 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.720
 quieter rear-view mirror that we've 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.360
 had 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.310
 in any baby w is something obviously 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.440
 very important because then good 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.480
 having such a quiet vehicle 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.650
 in the cabin, obviously we need 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.830
 a rearview mirror 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.590
 equally silent 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.050
 all these elements of the curtains of 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.870
 air of the air curtains what is 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.720
 the arn in the part below makes 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.240
 that the air enters here and allows us 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.820
 make the air flow quickly 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.480
 towards the back of the vehicle 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.810
 again improving everything that is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.830
 question there dynamic of the vehicle in the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.960
 front we have what is the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.060
 sien and the new ones activate that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.900
 newell's right now as we can see in 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.410
 camera are closed and this helps us 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.240
 improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle we 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.100
 allows when we are booting the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.380
 vehicle to make the engine 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.209
 hot more quickly and from this 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.800
 way obviously when we're 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.040
 we 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.540
 walking by road we decrease 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.620
 our fuel consumption and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.200
 only when we need to cool the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.200
 good engine, these vents are going to 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.750
 open the heart in everyone else w 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.670
 of course the engine and in this new 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:16.000
 series 7 we have the v8 twin power engine 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:19.210
 table with 445 horsepower and 480 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.640
 foot-pounds of torque that while they are 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.430
 numbers similar to those we have in 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.370
 the previous model now with this new 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.630
 engine we incorporate certain elements that 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.000
 they allow us to have a much faster 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.010
 connection and throttle response and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.690
 that's because we have two bikes two 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.910
 turbos trains road 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.910
 accelerate faster than tubes that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.620
 we are replacing and good certain 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.410
 design elements that allow to be a 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.510
 much softer engine and as I've already 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.650
 mentioned in that laser response 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.520
 since it is so important when 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.070
 we have that need to connect and 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.410
 of accelerating another element in the vehicle 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.400
 of design that we have in this new 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.910
 series 7 is like this line that in this 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.130
 case because it 's the it's about the 7 series 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.360
 with the sports package in word since 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.180
 is in black is one piece and of that 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.769
 way we avoid 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.500
 have any cut and they are that kind of 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.510
 details what they do 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.110
 and that this new your visit is still 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.110
 more special 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.020
 in the part of the interior 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.530
 man all the comfort 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.300
 and again we have two screens of 10 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.920
 inches 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.700
 and something new about our 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.700
 tablet 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.640
 and with this tablet we can control a 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.150
 endless functions we have 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.750
 available as raise and lower the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.000
 vents in the sunroof we have a 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.900
 vital function of program for 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.150
 keep our clients active 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.230
 inside the vehicle 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.370
 we have obviously also what is the 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.340
 wifi connection hotspot and we can also 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.530
 through a device with a 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.350
 cellular we can transmit say with 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.360
 One account 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.110
 and we can communicate with the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.660
 vehicle and play 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.660
 and movies on the back screens 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:50.240
 well this is the new c 17 in very 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.830
 briefly six generations 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.270
 keeping watching view performance 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.270
 thank you all, see you later
