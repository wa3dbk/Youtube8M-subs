RC<00:01:53.470> time<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> props<00:01:54.070> are<00:01:54.280> kind<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.550> flexing<00:01:54.970> a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
RC time of props are kind of flexing a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.930 
RC time of props are kind of flexing a
little<00:01:55.270> bit<00:01:55.390> too<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.860> probably<00:01:57.340> enough

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
little bit too so I probably enough

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.880 
little bit too so I probably enough
switching<00:01:58.450> propellers<00:01:59.050> because<00:01:59.320> these

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
switching propellers because these

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.580 
switching propellers because these
proper<00:02:00.430> kind<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.990> flexing<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.320> by<00:02:02.530> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
proper kind of flexing it this by the

proper kind of flexing it this by the
Sun<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:03.040> making<00:02:03.190> right<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:03.550> for<00:02:03.970> what<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.120> hear

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
Sun is making right now for what I hear

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.810 
Sun is making right now for what I hear
this<00:02:05.200> sounds<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.680> props<00:02:06.070> are<00:02:06.370> being

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
this sounds like the props are being

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.000 
this sounds like the props are being
flexed<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.780> was<00:02:07.930> getting<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.230> louder<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.830> it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
flexed it was getting a louder and it

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:27.270 
flexed it was getting a louder and it
kind<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.190> has<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.550> wash<00:02:10.420> sound<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.080> it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400 

got<00:02:27.820> my<00:02:27.940> GoPro<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.420> there<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:29.080> recording

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
got my GoPro on there I was recording

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
got my GoPro on there I was recording
earlier<00:02:29.920> kind<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.790> if<00:02:30.850> there's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
earlier kind of have to see if there's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.460 
earlier kind of have to see if there's
any<00:02:31.150> vibrations<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.720> yeah<00:02:35.110> that's<00:02:35.380> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
any vibrations or not so yeah that's a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.920 
any vibrations or not so yeah that's a
quick<00:02:35.710> demonstration<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.450> guys<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.810> know

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
quick demonstration so you guys you know

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.160 
quick demonstration so you guys you know
how<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.410> how<00:02:38.770> how<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.400> motors<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.540> Rankin

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
how it is how how this motors and Rankin

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:54.360 
how it is how how this motors and Rankin
handle<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.500> 10-pound<00:02:41.950> weight<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:54.310> they

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
handle a 10-pound weight I think they

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.890 
handle a 10-pound weight I think they
call<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.640> grade<00:02:54.970> my<00:02:55.210> confidence<00:02:55.750> or<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
call it grade my confidence or the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.320 
call it grade my confidence or the
repress<00:02:56.830> when<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.160> must<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.490> GoPro<00:02:57.880> right<00:02:58.150> in

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
repress when I must be GoPro right in

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.570 
repress when I must be GoPro right in
front<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.720> GPS<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.100> think<00:03:00.400> that's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
front of the GPS so I think that's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.970 
front of the GPS so I think that's
affecting<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.810> way<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.260> GPS<00:03:02.590> holds

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
affecting the way that the GPS holds

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:11.059 
affecting the way that the GPS holds
right<00:03:03.130> now<00:03:03.280> at<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.490> moment<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:06.100> off

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.160 

and<00:03:11.430> flying<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.060> about<00:03:12.360> five<00:03:12.629> minutes<00:03:13.019> with

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and flying for about five minutes with

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.229 
and flying for about five minutes with
the<00:03:13.260> 10-pound<00:03:13.709> weight

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.640 

still<00:03:20.840> hands-off

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
still hands-off

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470 
still hands-off
you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.519> see<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.790> they<00:03:23.939> stripped<00:03:24.269> off<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
you can see it they stripped off a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.319 
you can see it they stripped off a
little<00:03:24.870> bit<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.230> once<00:03:25.379> again<00:03:25.610> I'm<00:03:26.610> in<00:03:27.150> front

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
little bit but once again I'm in front

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.789 
little bit but once again I'm in front
of<00:03:27.390> my<00:03:27.480> house<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:27.750> maybe<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.500> house<00:03:28.680> is

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
of my house so maybe that house is

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.460 
of my house so maybe that house is
blocking<00:03:29.189> some<00:03:29.370> GPS<00:03:29.819> signals<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.629> I'm<00:03:31.260> not

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
blocking some GPS signals and I'm not

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.699 
blocking some GPS signals and I'm not
that<00:03:31.650> high<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.689> also<00:03:33.689> I've<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.349> go<00:03:34.500> pro

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
that high and also I've not to go pro

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.740 
that high and also I've not to go pro
once<00:03:34.920> again<00:03:35.159> let's<00:03:35.370> run<00:03:35.519> up<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> GPS<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
once again let's run up the GPS so that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.319 
once again let's run up the GPS so that
could<00:03:36.959> be<00:03:37.170> assessing<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.310> bit<00:03:38.459> you

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
could be assessing it a little bit you

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.649 
could be assessing it a little bit you
can<00:03:39.540> see<00:03:40.099> this<00:03:41.099> frame<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.640> rock-solid<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
can see this frame is rock-solid the

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.140 
can see this frame is rock-solid the
cops<00:03:42.840> dirty<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.349> is<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:44.430> handles<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.879> weight

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
cops dirty it is it handles the weight

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.050 
cops dirty it is it handles the weight
with<00:03:45.329> no<00:03:45.510> problem<00:03:50.000> all<00:03:51.000> right<00:03:52.760> going<00:03:53.760> awesome

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
with no problem all right going awesome

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.349 
with no problem all right going awesome
use<00:03:54.420> my<00:03:54.659> low<00:03:55.290> voltage<00:03:55.620> kicked<00:03:55.920> in

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
use my low voltage kicked in

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.420 
use my low voltage kicked in
actually<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.420> increased<00:03:58.049> my<00:03:58.170> sensor<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.250> think

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
actually I increased my sensor I think

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.309 
actually I increased my sensor I think
to<00:03:59.489> 24<00:03:59.970> volts<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:00.480> when<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.780> picks<00:04:00.989> up<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.200> know

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
to 24 volts so when it picks up you know

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.979 
to 24 volts so when it picks up you know
it<00:04:01.500> did<00:04:01.620> under<00:04:02.099> 24<00:04:02.549> volts<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.970> will<00:04:03.150> blink<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
it did under 24 volts it will blink and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.229 
it did under 24 volts it will blink and
that's<00:04:04.109> letting<00:04:04.319> me<00:04:04.379> know<00:04:04.409> that<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
that's letting me know that that the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.509 
that's letting me know that that the
battery<00:04:07.170> calibration<00:04:07.889> is<00:04:07.980> actually<00:04:08.310> working

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
battery calibration is actually working

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.759 
battery calibration is actually working
so<00:04:08.700> let<00:04:09.060> me<00:04:09.150> give<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.359> guys<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:09.510> closer<00:04:09.900> look<00:04:10.200> at

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
so let me give you guys a closer look at

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.289 
so let me give you guys a closer look at
the<00:04:11.099> battery<00:04:11.519> for<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.540> at<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.870> weight<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:14.299> let

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
the battery for it at the weight so let

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.060 
the battery for it at the weight so let
me<00:04:15.359> put<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.629> camera<00:04:15.780> down<00:04:15.930> real<00:04:16.289> quick<00:04:16.530> then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
me put the camera down real quick then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
me put the camera down real quick then
let<00:04:17.310> me<00:04:17.370> unplug<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.910> battery<00:04:18.090> because<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.750> like

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
let me unplug the battery because I like

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.020 
let me unplug the battery because I like
always<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.829> don't<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.459> battery<00:04:20.759> when<00:04:21.000> I

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
always I don't like the battery when I

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.610 
always I don't like the battery when I
am<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:22.470> know

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
am you know

touching the model but you can see got a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.409 
touching the model but you can see got a
10-pound<00:04:25.320> weight<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:26.039> let<00:04:26.430> me<00:04:26.520> try<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
guys an idea of how heavy this weight is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.460 
guys an idea of how heavy this weight is
to<00:05:00.030> prove<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.539> is<00:05:00.659> ten<00:05:00.930> pounds<00:05:01.110> let<00:05:01.409> me

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
to prove that it is ten pounds let me

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.719 
to prove that it is ten pounds let me
try<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.680> put<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.070> where<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.310> landing<00:05:02.550> gears

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
try to put it where the landing gears

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.110 
try to put it where the landing gears
are<00:05:02.940> listen<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.080> see<00:05:04.849> put<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:05.970> down

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
are listen and you can see put it down

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.939 
are listen and you can see put it down
and<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.720> actually<00:05:06.810> lifted<00:05:07.229> up<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.409> you<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.800> it

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
and it actually lifted up so you know it

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.490 
and it actually lifted up so you know it
is<00:05:08.099> pretty<00:05:08.699> heavy<00:05:08.880> so<00:05:09.240> yeah<00:05:09.500> motor

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
is pretty heavy so yeah motor

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.240 
is pretty heavy so yeah motor
temperature<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.310> would<00:05:11.970> say<00:05:12.090> it's<00:05:12.180> about<00:05:13.250> 110

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
temperature I would say it's about 110

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.010 
temperature I would say it's about 110
it<00:05:14.849> is<00:05:15.000> getting<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.300> little<00:05:15.419> warmer<00:05:15.780> with<00:05:15.960> the

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
it is getting a little warmer with the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.899 
it is getting a little warmer with the
10-pound<00:05:16.470> weight<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:16.830> about<00:05:16.919> 110<00:05:17.460> I'll

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
10-pound weight so it's about 110 I'll

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.210 
10-pound weight so it's about 110 I'll
probably<00:05:18.330> end<00:05:18.539> up<00:05:18.599> switching<00:05:18.840> motors<00:05:19.320> from

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
probably end up switching motors from

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.279 
probably end up switching motors from
the<00:05:20.310> RC<00:05:20.520> timer<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:20.909> if<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.060> end<00:05:21.210> up<00:05:21.300> using<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.870> t

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
the RC timer so if I end up using the t

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.870 
the RC timer so if I end up using the t
motors<00:05:22.590> because<00:05:22.680> they<00:05:22.830> have<00:05:22.949> a<00:05:23.190> lot<00:05:23.580> bigger

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
motors because they have a lot bigger

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.640 
motors because they have a lot bigger
diameter<00:05:24.090> bearings<00:05:24.599> which<00:05:25.229> would<00:05:25.380> be<00:05:25.470> better

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
diameter bearings which would be better

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.860 
diameter bearings which would be better
for<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.520> extra<00:05:26.789> weight<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.150> also<00:05:27.750> be

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
for the extra weight and also be

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.149 
for the extra weight and also be
switching<00:05:28.199> out<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.349> props<00:05:28.710> because<00:05:28.919> these

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
switching out the props because these

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.269 
switching out the props because these
props<00:05:29.490> are<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:30.599> can<00:05:30.750> see<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.139> little<00:05:31.469> flexible

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
props are you can see a little flexible

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.550 
props are you can see a little flexible
for<00:05:32.580> carrying<00:05:33.060> a<00:05:33.240> lot<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.450> weight<00:05:33.599> I<00:05:33.930> guess<00:05:34.469> it

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
for carrying a lot of weight I guess it

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.959 
for carrying a lot of weight I guess it
would<00:05:34.650> be<00:05:34.740> good<00:05:34.919> for<00:05:34.950> like<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.250> smaller<00:05:35.520> camera

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
would be good for like a smaller camera

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.850 
would be good for like a smaller camera
like<00:05:37.159> any<00:05:38.159> x5<00:05:38.729> or<00:05:38.759> any<00:05:39.149> x7<00:05:39.659> but<00:05:40.439> for<00:05:40.649> like<00:05:40.739> a

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
like any x5 or any x7 but for like a

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.149 
like any x5 or any x7 but for like a
bigger<00:05:41.039> DSLR<00:05:41.999> like<00:05:42.149> a<00:05:42.239> like<00:05:42.899> a<00:05:42.929> canon<00:05:43.289> 5d<00:05:43.529> or<00:05:43.799> uh

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
bigger DSLR like a like a canon 5d or uh

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.629 
bigger DSLR like a like a canon 5d or uh
you<00:05:44.579> know<00:05:44.669> just<00:05:44.819> one<00:05:45.299> of<00:05:45.329> the<00:05:45.419> bigger<00:05:45.599> puck

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
you know just one of the bigger puck

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.699 
you know just one of the bigger puck
cameras<00:05:47.719> for<00:05:48.719> example<00:05:48.749> a<00:05:49.199> 10<00:05:49.409> pound<00:05:49.649> weight

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:49.709 
cameras for example a 10 pound weight

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.559 
cameras for example a 10 pound weight
the<00:05:50.399> motors<00:05:50.729> do<00:05:50.819> get<00:05:50.969> a<00:05:50.999> little<00:05:51.059> bit<00:05:51.209> warmer

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
the motors do get a little bit warmer

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.479 
the motors do get a little bit warmer
and<00:05:51.719> the<00:05:51.869> props<00:05:52.259> are<00:05:52.499> flexing<00:05:53.099> a<00:05:53.159> little<00:05:53.369> bit

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:53.489 
and the props are flexing a little bit

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:54.559 
and the props are flexing a little bit
you<00:05:53.549> can<00:05:53.669> hear<00:05:53.819> it's<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:53.939> little<00:05:54.119> bit<00:05:54.209> louder<00:05:54.389> in

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
you can hear it's a little bit louder in

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:55.609 
you can hear it's a little bit louder in
flight<00:05:54.809> but<00:05:54.989> yeah<00:05:55.110> that's<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.469> quick

00:05:55.609 --> 00:05:55.619 
flight but yeah that's a quick

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.829 
flight but yeah that's a quick
demonstration<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:57.419> know<00:05:57.509> hope<00:05:57.629> you<00:05:57.719> guys

enjoyed it it was pretty interesting to
see<00:05:59.759> how<00:05:59.909> much<00:06:00.089> this<00:06:00.389> frame<00:06:00.689> can<00:06:00.899> actually

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
see how much this frame can actually

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.959 
see how much this frame can actually
lift<00:06:01.439> so<00:06:02.039> it's<00:06:02.159> pretty<00:06:02.309> exciting<00:06:02.429> and<00:06:02.909> the
