00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.530 
quarter of the screen almost a quarter

taken<00:04:56.870> up<00:04:56.990> by<00:04:57.020> data<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:58.880> data<00:04:59.150> is

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
taken up by data and that data is

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.540 
taken up by data and that data is
important<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.380> gameplay<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:01.220> think<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
important to the gameplay but I think it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.600 
important to the gameplay but I think it
could<00:05:01.640> have<00:05:01.790> been<00:05:02.560> hidden<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.650> little<00:05:03.800> better

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
could have been hidden a little better

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.360 
could have been hidden a little better
than<00:05:04.880> they<00:05:05.030> did<00:05:05.320> instead<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.530> giant<00:05:06.950> blue

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.580 
than they did instead of a giant blue

other complete about this game is that

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.920 
other complete about this game is that
it's<00:05:23.540> only<00:05:23.660> one<00:05:23.900> player<00:05:24.200> on<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.620> Genesis<00:05:25.130> and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
it's only one player on the Genesis and

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.120 
it's only one player on the Genesis and
been<00:05:26.930> doing<00:05:27.050> my<00:05:27.260> research<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.710> found<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:27.980> that

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
been doing my research I found out that

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.710 
been doing my research I found out that
the<00:05:28.250> arcade<00:05:28.670> version<00:05:28.700> of<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:29.180> game<00:05:29.360> was<00:05:29.570> in

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
the arcade version of this game was in

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.370 
the arcade version of this game was in
fact<00:05:29.930> three<00:05:30.320> players<00:05:31.330> so<00:05:32.330> what<00:05:33.020> could<00:05:33.260> have

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
fact three players so what could have

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.430 
fact three players so what could have
been<00:05:33.530> a<00:05:33.590> very<00:05:33.740> good<00:05:34.010> at<00:05:34.430> least<00:05:34.610> two-player

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
been a very good at least two-player

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.280 
been a very good at least two-player
simultaneous<00:05:36.460> gameplay<00:05:37.460> game<00:05:37.960> before<00:05:38.960> the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
simultaneous gameplay game before the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.650 
simultaneous gameplay game before the
Genesis<00:05:39.740> we're<00:05:40.250> stuck<00:05:40.460> with<00:05:40.580> one<00:05:40.790> player<00:05:41.060> I'm

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
Genesis we're stuck with one player I'm

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.830 
Genesis we're stuck with one player I'm
not<00:05:41.810> quite<00:05:42.050> sure<00:05:42.080> why<00:05:42.680> that<00:05:43.100> is<00:05:43.420> it<00:05:44.420> might<00:05:44.690> have

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
not quite sure why that is it might have

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.360 
not quite sure why that is it might have
to<00:05:44.960> do<00:05:45.050> with<00:05:45.080> technical<00:05:45.680> limitations<00:05:46.190> because

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
to do with technical limitations because

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.520 
to do with technical limitations because
frankly<00:05:47.180> this<00:05:47.360> game<00:05:47.600> plays<00:05:47.870> pretty<00:05:48.230> darn

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
frankly this game plays pretty darn

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.510 
frankly this game plays pretty darn
smooth<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:51.020> think<00:05:51.290> that<00:05:51.440> maybe<00:05:51.920> they<00:05:52.130> opted

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
smooth and I think that maybe they opted

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.160 
smooth and I think that maybe they opted
for<00:05:52.640> one<00:05:52.790> player<00:05:53.030> because<00:05:53.450> two-player

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
for one player because two-player

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.810 
for one player because two-player
simultaneous<00:05:54.380> gameplay<00:05:55.250> would<00:05:55.730> have

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
simultaneous gameplay would have

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.850 
simultaneous gameplay would have
actually<00:05:56.000> taken<00:05:56.390> away<00:05:56.840> from<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.260> quality<00:05:57.740> of

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
actually taken away from the quality of

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.500 
actually taken away from the quality of
the<00:05:57.980> final<00:05:58.430> product

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.420 

now<00:06:03.050> as<00:06:03.290> you<00:06:03.410> can<00:06:03.500> see<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:03.800> have<00:06:03.920> a<00:06:04.040> set<00:06:04.280> number

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
now as you can see you have a set number

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.690 
now as you can see you have a set number
of<00:06:04.610> continues<00:06:05.270> in<00:06:06.230> the<00:06:06.410> game<00:06:06.590> and<00:06:06.890> after<00:06:07.610> you

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
of continues in the game and after you

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.160 
of continues in the game and after you
run<00:06:07.820> on<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:07.970> continues<00:06:08.360> that's<00:06:08.480> it<00:06:08.660> it's<00:06:08.870> game

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
run on a continues that's it it's game

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.760 
run on a continues that's it it's game
over

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
over

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.760 
over
and<00:06:10.150> while<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.360> skill<00:06:11.660> level<00:06:11.960> felt<00:06:12.230> pretty<00:06:12.500> on

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
and while the skill level felt pretty on

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.250 
and while the skill level felt pretty on
point<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:14.210> changes<00:06:14.690> once<00:06:14.870> you<00:06:14.960> get<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.140> the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
point that changes once you get to the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.930 
point that changes once you get to the
end<00:06:15.410> bosses<00:06:15.650> they<00:06:16.010> seem<00:06:16.220> to<00:06:16.400> pretty<00:06:16.730> much

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
end bosses they seem to pretty much

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.450 
end bosses they seem to pretty much
annihilate<00:06:17.540> you<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:17.960> at<00:06:18.500> least<00:06:18.650> wipe<00:06:19.220> you<00:06:19.400> out

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
annihilate you and at least wipe you out

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.740 
annihilate you and at least wipe you out
once<00:06:20.380> during<00:06:21.380> gameplay<00:06:22.390> essentially<00:06:23.390> using

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
once during gameplay essentially using

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.380 
once during gameplay essentially using
up<00:06:23.900> your<00:06:23.930> continue<00:06:24.850> now<00:06:25.850> that<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.210> course

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
up your continue now that of course

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.020 
up your continue now that of course
could<00:06:26.660> be<00:06:26.720> offset<00:06:27.380> by<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.790> involvement<00:06:28.790> of<00:06:28.970> a

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
could be offset by the involvement of a

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.690 
could be offset by the involvement of a
second<00:06:29.390> player<00:06:29.600> to<00:06:29.840> help<00:06:30.050> deflect<00:06:30.680> some<00:06:31.580> of

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
second player to help deflect some of

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.020

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
the heat of the end bosses from you it's

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.490 
the heat of the end bosses from you it's
just<00:06:35.300> really<00:06:35.480> a<00:06:35.600> shame<00:06:35.900> that<00:06:36.080> this<00:06:36.230> feature

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
just really a shame that this feature

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.840
