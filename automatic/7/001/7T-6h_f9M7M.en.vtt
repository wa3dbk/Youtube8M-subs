00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.120
 continue hamburg with the paint the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.360
 basis is blue that we the whole 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 only then taped and put the blog 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 which would be red afterwards 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 follow painted red to the conclusion now that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 removed tape and then comes 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.390
 finally the original color scheme for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.390
 the fore 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 that is very important that you gentleman here 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.250
 clean works with the tape 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 but sometimes it is still isolated 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
 they are not reworked 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.629
 have become so clean at the first 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.629
 start 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 after that would be 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 parts of the cargo hold the hatch and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.650
 other decks superstructures painted and to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.650
 circuit of the boat composed 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.510
 then the bread is ready for painting 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.380
 the first test ride with color in ours 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.690
 Proven test basin it works 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.479
 Everything went so well and we got together 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.150
 decided the boat now in larger 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.410
 waterways once 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.869
 this was the occasion when 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.560
 summer party of the modellbau club share in 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.020
 bad ems there is a 40 times 13 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.830
 meter long basin only for model 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.300
 key on the anniversary also from 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.300
 Guests must be driven 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.350
 Our container ship has been doing very well 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.119
 beaten and we also have a new one 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 technical development with on board 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.640
 had on the bridge around a camera 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 assemble the over a 585 stretch 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 mission statement has sent to the country and even 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 the picture then on display from it 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.330
 works only with 5.8 ghz 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.210
 achieved with two gigahertz of cameras 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.189
 one remote controls too many disorders 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.189
 this frequency significantly disturb 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.550
 not only to water but also to land 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.460
 news from the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.100
 container bridge the meantime too 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.040
 was painted and now 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.690
 then tested together with the boat 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 the boat was at the terminal kaymer 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 and we problems the first time one 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.110
 container with the crane out of the boat too 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.110
 to lift 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.210
 we partly have the guides again 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.790
 they are also likely to be elicited 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.520
 stay without paint because the container 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.290
 There are better gliding in principle 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.190
 works the b and unloading 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.190
 but very good 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 if the container has a roof that 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.410
 is thin enough and the metal in the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.930
 container that of the magnets in the 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.890
 attracted spokesman is thus very much took 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.300
 later it can even take him two 20 feet 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.300
 container to be lifted at once 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:05.819
 22 above are also normal in prototypical and 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.579
 it is also here in the model in the 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.409
 sense said metz video and can exist 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.260
 certainly still some to tinker 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.700
 as well as on the boat but in total 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.700
 made a lot
