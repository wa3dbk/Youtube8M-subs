beastly<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.390> when<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.630> turn<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.650> seems

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
beastly and when you turn it on it seems

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.680 
beastly and when you turn it on it seems
like<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.610> fans<00:03:03.850> go<00:03:04.120> off<00:03:04.240> at<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> same

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
like all the fans go off at the same

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.080 
like all the fans go off at the same
time<00:03:04.960> so<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.320> sounds<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.650> beast<00:03:06.090> just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
time so it sounds like a beast just

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.910 
time so it sounds like a beast just
turned<00:03:07.300> on<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.810> then<00:03:08.170> all<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> fans<00:03:08.620> quiet

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
down and eventually once the system

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.760 
down and eventually once the system
boots<00:03:10.630> up<00:03:10.870> that's<00:03:11.140> when<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.350> lighting<00:03:11.620> system

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
boots up that's when the lighting system

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.520
