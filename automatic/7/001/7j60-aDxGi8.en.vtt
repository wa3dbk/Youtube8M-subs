00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 Tell me guys, here 's the caps ice and see. 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 I got 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.650
 I bought leonel messi after a lot 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.870
 very much effort followed and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 I finally got him missing a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.270
 to protect ronaldo but the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.220
 people come there too I bought 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 1,600,000 coins and the average market 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 since then seven hundred thousand 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.830
 I probably make a profit up 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 his 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 I soon got him and did not even want to know. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 I put it on the first team that I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 had to the Ivory Coast team that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.149
 by the way, after I do not 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.620
 I lost no match playing with the team 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.389
 of the ivory coast 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 I put the messi is evident with the 

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:47.789
 half the training him to 16 his position 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.829
 I put it on and put it on to play 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.639
 first match I had in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 It happened 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:55.440
 according to this game it was there he gave up after 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.459
 I find it strange that he got scared 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 from messi 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:01.019
 I think that Messi's great strength is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.399
 I'm scared I think the way this video 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.339
 It's going to be very fast here, I'm not going to talk. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.590
 much about the analysis of messi because I 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 I played three or four matches just to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.189
 show you that I got it and the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 The first thing I've noticed is the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.149
 speed his ball control as 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.439
 You can tell he's running with 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.719
 lucas who is one of the most 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 that has a whole game and he 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.380
 betting race won is the first 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 head ball but just wanted to show 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.119
 this bid to show that it is very 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.710
 fast and worth playing with 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.780
 there I finished my first goal with the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 messi was sent off 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 It's very good power of feathers but I wanted 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.960
 put him just for the first game already 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.520
 make the first goal alone with him there 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100
 also beating a little bit to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.539
 practically indefensible left 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.039
 hesperange if anyone wants to learn from 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.409
 boot then I give a touch 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.590
 Something else I noticed until 1 and I know that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.130
 goal should have done what I then I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.130
 I did a mixed league and league game. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.139
 bbva half fast the Argentinean just to have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.179
 a little better chemistry of Messi and 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:05.100
 to make the most of it in the field 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.170
 still Tuesday may be a 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.720
 A little more accustomed was a little more 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.510
 and I discovered that Messi crosses and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.100
 It goes very well, the ball looks like it has 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.200
 a police station 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.600
 I managed to make at least three goals 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.370
 of similar crossings with that gave 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.650
 to realize that the messi seems to him 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.120
 places the ball with the hand in the players 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 These are things I noticed right from the face of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.520
 messi who is very fast has a control 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.310
 and ball in domain for it crosses and 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.380
 It goes very well, his touch seems to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.640
 He plays fast and strong, that's fine. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.590
 awesome that touch the ball 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.710
 It took months to get him in the face. 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.330
 play accurately and very fast 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.000
 leave the ball is very easy yours 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.310
 players then the first one I think 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.620
 I will not miss eating it as well 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.180
 I think it's going to be good to play. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.210
 with him because he is a good point guard 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.760
 plays and also beats very strong in this 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.250
 bid and it could have been the goal more 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.420
 I just wobbled, it 's this other one I 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.330
 I think it's cool. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.580
 I sent the ball there is almost a goal and in 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.230
 had a corner kick. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 something a little different 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.980
 I called the second player and who did not 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 knows has a very good rate called 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.180
 second player to take a cruise one 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.980
 crusade and then one with a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.330
 crossing is slightly larger 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.060
 You always end up getting caught up. 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.950
 Unprepared but that's how I said it. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.450
 few matches start, could not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.500
 feel 100% still 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.480
 You can already understand that I liked it 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.700
 enough of it is very well out of the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.190
 area that this ball in the dash can 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.130
 realize I have made for just one goal 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.960
 really start kicking out of the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.550
 area but you have to do many 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.500
 others when it cost me a little more 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.300
 with his game I think that way with 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.910
 ball control devices 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.310
 sensational very fast plays 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.260
 perfectly and sewage and left just to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.730
 be funny was cruising by in the face of 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 Trickster was go 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.320
 well this was the goal I made start him 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.050
 is also outside the area without anyone 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.630
 in front is almost impossible to goal 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.800
 then the messi is that I can say of him 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.390
 that not only give an overview 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.580
 very fast 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.580
 the sensational ball domain passes 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.130
 very well lets the player in the face of the goal 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.870
 crosses sensationally and has a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.420
 both left and right leg 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.609
 right leg that prior analysis that 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.040
 I did a team as I said well because it was 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.020
 from the bbva league 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.180
 I'm going to build a much better team in the next 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.250
 but I will not show you another team 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.930
 that I made of the ivory coast that until 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.699
 now does not lose any match with 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.220
 he by the way I've played with this 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.199
 training 3 5 2 working out right for me good 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.940
 As I said a video very fast, I'm going 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.100
 show more content and messi the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.169
 next video you're sure to 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.280
 showing cooler bids with him than 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.800
 I have a little more time to 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 play and that's it we'll follow that 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.759
 I'm going to play for at least a couple of weeks. 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.220
 start after he comes in search of 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.199
 cristiano ronaldo this is it people here 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.199
 it's options and turning off
