workouts I did and then it grew into

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.940 
workouts I did and then it grew into
something<00:01:30.109> that<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:30.469> knew<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.649> could<00:01:30.740> do

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
something that I knew I could do

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.769 
something that I knew I could do
full-time<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.399> wanted<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.969> continue<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.659> be

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
full-time I wanted to continue to be

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.179 
full-time I wanted to continue to be
around<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.079> game<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.350> basketball<00:01:33.439> but<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.009> knew

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
around the game of basketball but I knew

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.099 
around the game of basketball but I knew
since<00:01:35.149> I<00:01:35.209> was<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.359> short<00:01:35.569> white<00:01:35.749> guy<00:01:35.899> that<00:01:36.049> I

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
since I was a short white guy that I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.389 
since I was a short white guy that I
wasn't<00:01:36.289> gonna<00:01:36.439> have<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.649> playing<00:01:36.920> career<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:37.369> I

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
wasn't gonna have a playing career so I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.160 
wasn't gonna have a playing career so I
thought<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.909> staying<00:01:38.689> in<00:01:38.779> the<00:01:38.869> training

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
thought that staying in the training

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.179 
thought that staying in the training
industry<00:01:39.380> would<00:01:39.590> be<00:01:39.649> something<00:01:39.859> that<00:01:40.009> would

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
industry would be something that would

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.919 
industry would be something that would
definitely<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.609> good<00:01:40.759> moving<00:01:41.359> forward<00:01:41.689> and

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
definitely be good moving forward and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.469 
definitely be good moving forward and
you<00:01:42.499> plan<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:42.859> continuing<00:01:43.039> only<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:43.939> or<00:01:44.270> do

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
you plan on continuing only this or do

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.539 
you plan on continuing only this or do
you<00:01:44.539> want<00:01:44.749> to<00:01:44.929> expand<00:01:45.349> it<00:01:45.499> do<00:01:46.039> anything<00:01:46.249> more
