is very attractive the next feature to
talk<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> third<00:01:10.409> valve<00:01:10.799> stop<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
talk about is the third valve stop the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
talk about is the third valve stop the
third<00:01:12.000> valve<00:01:12.270> offer<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.350> extended

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
third valve offer is actually extended

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
third valve offer is actually extended
and<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.820> placed<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.540> outside<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and it's placed on the outside of the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
and it's placed on the outside of the
tube<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.189> ends<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.520> doing<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
tube and what this ends up doing is it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
tube and what this ends up doing is it
allows<00:01:19.020> two<00:01:19.229> player<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> true

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
allows two player to get down to a true

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960 
allows two player to get down to a true
blow<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> stopper<00:01:22.950> ring<00:01:23.189> itself<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.790> also

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
blow out the stopper ring itself is also

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
blow out the stopper ring itself is also
quarter<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> weight<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> normal<00:01:25.560> stuff<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
quarter the weight of the normal stuff a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
quarter the weight of the normal stuff a
ring<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.450> not<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.780> completely

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
ring it also does not go completely

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
ring it also does not go completely
around<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.400> combination<00:01:30.090> allows

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
around and what this combination allows

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
around and what this combination allows
is<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.470> ergonomic<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.310> little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
is a little bit more ergonomic a little

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.950 
is a little bit more ergonomic a little
bit<00:01:32.759> more<00:01:32.909> comfortable<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> also

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bit more comfortable and it also

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
bit more comfortable and it also
improves<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.890> projection<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
improves the projection of the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.620 
improves the projection of the
instrument<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.119> we're<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> talk
