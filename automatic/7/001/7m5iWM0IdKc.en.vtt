00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.450
 Iodine, such as Ritsumeikan University 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:11.080
 Is good 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:12.940
 Than has developed a rim system but this time after Aiya is a plant in the plant power generation 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.580
 I will explain 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:22.750
 First I will explain what kind of plant power is 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 Here is this food-powered battery 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.670
 Connect a tester to this electrode 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.670
 Apparently the first 0 v 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.260
 bobo 0 bold rice sprouting 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.460
 In this way, the final 0.8 ball and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.980
 Low pressure of the light comes out 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
 As a principle of this power generation 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:04.730
 A common dry cell consists of a governmental electrode and the previous one 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:08.760
 However, there are two electrodes and plants shown here as 100 power generation from this. 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.360
 Especially this electrode 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.080
 Pass through the plant by cutting into the plant 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.190
 posting 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.190
 It is why aqueous solution of is generating electric power by a turning station 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.000
 This is the wire we developed this time Plant 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.530
 It is a monitoring system 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.150
 the system 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.310
 With plant power sensor 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.939
 It consists of a receiver 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.409
 Postprandial and power production was to introduce you about earlier 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.990
 With plant power wrench 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.690
 It consists of a transmitter 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.409
 This so popular developed this time 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.880
 Though it is a stem 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.870
 Of the spot fine 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.730
 This is a dragon 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.730
 And stored in the condenser 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.860
 In large transmitter power consumption 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:13.780
 By making the power supply circuit driven intermittently 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.780
 Successful transmission of radio 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.260
 This system is about 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.790
 30 to 40 minutes here 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.230
 Shinkin 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.550
 Ugh exhibit the data 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.550
 Will be able to 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.819
 Botanical 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.760
 Low water condition and plants 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.980
 If the condition is bad , the water will suck up 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.100
 Become weak 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.580
 Less current is accumulated in the capacitor 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.170
 Because of this 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.760
 To the transmitter 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:04.290
 Because the sense of being able to transmit the radio will be very long 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.750
 Sense of transmitter receiver 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 If the monitoring interval is monitored , 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 If you can check your health 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.530
 It will be said 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.850
 So actually this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.850
 System 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.030
 To fly the radio 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.030
 I want to show you 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.879
 The system developed this time is useful for a large farm head that can not reach one reach because no battery is required. 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:51.860
 I think 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:52.819
 I would like to contribute to stable farmers through monitoring of candidate plants 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.599
 I will 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.599
 Also, is this system wireless? 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:09.150
 Since it say not to interfere in people is also an advantage 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 I would like to further promote this research to become a deputy director
