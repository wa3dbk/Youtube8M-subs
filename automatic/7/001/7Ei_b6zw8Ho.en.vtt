a marksman don't ask me why and as you
can<00:02:32.540> see<00:02:32.600> actually<00:02:33.500> increased<00:02:33.950> 100<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.350> now

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
can see actually increased 100 and now

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.060 
can see actually increased 100 and now
once<00:02:36.950> again<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.550> level<00:02:37.940> up

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.120 

and<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:44.850> have<00:02:44.990> actually<00:02:45.990> level<00:02:46.410> 100
