here's<00:00:06.279> a<00:00:06.310> little<00:00:06.490> preview<00:00:06.640> video<00:00:07.090> talking

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
here's a little preview video talking

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.340 
here's a little preview video talking
about<00:00:07.899> what<00:00:08.080> I<00:00:08.260> did<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.680> this<00:00:08.799> metal<00:00:09.790> zone

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
about what I did to this metal zone

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.209 
about what I did to this metal zone
before<00:00:11.350> you<00:00:11.590> can<00:00:11.740> actually<00:00:11.860> hear<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.129> sound

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
before you can actually hear the sound

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.640 
before you can actually hear the sound
demo<00:00:12.670> I<00:00:12.849> went<00:00:13.360> ahead<00:00:13.420> and<00:00:13.570> I've<00:00:14.230> always<00:00:14.380> liked

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
demo I went ahead and I've always liked

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.690 
demo I went ahead and I've always liked
these<00:00:14.740> pedals<00:00:15.130> because<00:00:15.280> they're<00:00:15.580> really

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
these pedals because they're really

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.999 
these pedals because they're really
heavy<00:00:16.000> you<00:00:16.299> know<00:00:16.509> sounding<00:00:16.960> but<00:00:17.110> the<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.770> could

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009 
heavy you know sounding but the I could

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.290 
heavy you know sounding but the I could
never<00:00:18.130> get<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.369> sound<00:00:18.640> that<00:00:18.730> I<00:00:18.820> was<00:00:18.939> happy<00:00:19.210> with

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
never get a sound that I was happy with

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.490 
never get a sound that I was happy with
even<00:00:19.599> though<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.750> equalizer<00:00:20.110> was<00:00:20.320> pretty

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
even though the equalizer was pretty

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.950 
even though the equalizer was pretty
cool<00:00:20.680> it<00:00:20.890> was<00:00:21.610> just<00:00:21.790> on<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:21.939> tooth<00:00:22.210> plastic<00:00:22.840> key

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
cool it was just on a tooth plastic key

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.620 
cool it was just on a tooth plastic key
and<00:00:23.079> synthetic<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.369> I<00:00:24.399> finally<00:00:24.790> you<00:00:25.360> know<00:00:25.480> got

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
and synthetic so I finally you know got

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.330 
and synthetic so I finally you know got
the<00:00:25.750> guts<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.079> go<00:00:26.140> in<00:00:26.320> there<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.590> tweak<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:27.309> a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
the guts to go in there and tweak it a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.220 
the guts to go in there and tweak it a
little<00:00:27.460> bit<00:00:27.790> and<00:00:28.329> what<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.509> did<00:00:28.689> essentially<00:00:29.050> is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
little bit and what I did essentially is

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.780 
little bit and what I did essentially is
just<00:00:29.259> took<00:00:29.919> off<00:00:30.070> some<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.369> really<00:00:30.579> harsh

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
just took off some of the really harsh

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.229 
just took off some of the really harsh
high-end<00:00:31.239> I<00:00:31.649> shift<00:00:32.649> equalizer<00:00:33.220> so<00:00:33.520> it's<00:00:34.180> a

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
high-end I shift equalizer so it's a

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.090 
high-end I shift equalizer so it's a
little<00:00:34.360> more<00:00:34.480> musical<00:00:35.079> and<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.739> doesn't<00:00:35.980> have

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
little more musical and it doesn't have

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.590 
little more musical and it doesn't have
that<00:00:36.130> weird<00:00:36.399> kind<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.850> scooped<00:00:37.150> out<00:00:37.270> mid

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
that weird kind of scooped out mid

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.350 
that weird kind of scooped out mid
plasticky<00:00:38.230> sound<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:39.010> then<00:00:39.580> I<00:00:39.610> finally<00:00:40.330> I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
plasticky sound and then I finally I

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.810 
plasticky sound and then I finally I
went<00:00:40.570> ahead<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:40.780> tweaked<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.820> clipping

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
went ahead and tweaked the clipping

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.150 
went ahead and tweaked the clipping
section<00:00:43.300> with<00:00:44.140> asymmetrical<00:00:44.740> clipping<00:00:45.070> so

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
section with asymmetrical clipping so

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.380 
section with asymmetrical clipping so
that<00:00:45.280> way<00:00:45.400> it<00:00:45.670> sounds<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.940> little<00:00:46.030> more<00:00:46.150> like<00:00:46.240> a

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
that way it sounds a little more like a

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.390 
that way it sounds a little more like a
tube<00:00:46.570> amp<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:47.050> mean<00:00:47.560> I<00:00:47.650> wanted<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:47.950> retain<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.310> lot

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
tube amp I mean I wanted to retain a lot

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.710 
tube amp I mean I wanted to retain a lot
of<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.640> crunch<00:00:48.850> for<00:00:49.090> sure<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.240> wanted<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.570> keep

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
of the crunch for sure I wanted to keep

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.380 
of the crunch for sure I wanted to keep
it<00:00:49.840> a<00:00:49.900> metal<00:00:50.170> pedal<00:00:50.470> but<00:00:51.130> I<00:00:51.579> went<00:00:52.150> ahead<00:00:52.240> and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
it a metal pedal but I went ahead and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.030 
it a metal pedal but I went ahead and
it's<00:00:52.750> definitely<00:00:53.200> more<00:00:53.320> musical<00:00:53.710> sounding

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
it's definitely more musical sounding

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.650 
it's definitely more musical sounding
and<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.670> left<00:00:54.850> these<00:00:55.030> pretty<00:00:55.300> much<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.540> same

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
and I left these pretty much the same

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.940 
and I left these pretty much the same
exact<00:00:56.020> settings<00:00:56.380> that<00:00:56.500> you're<00:00:56.739> going<00:00:56.890> to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
exact settings that you're going to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.650 
exact settings that you're going to
you're<00:00:57.280> gonna<00:00:57.370> hear<00:00:57.700> on<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.880> demo<00:00:58.120> video<00:00:58.390> I

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
you're gonna hear on the demo video I

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.390 
you're gonna hear on the demo video I
just<00:00:59.170> wanted<00:00:59.470> to<00:00:59.560> leave<00:00:59.680> it<00:00:59.770> up<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.950> middle<00:01:00.220> so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
just wanted to leave it up the middle so

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.590 
just wanted to leave it up the middle so
that<00:01:00.520> way<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.700> can<00:01:00.910> have<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.090> option<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.510> add

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
that way you can have the option to add

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200 
that way you can have the option to add
more<00:01:01.810> gain<00:01:02.079> or<00:01:02.350> more<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.739> queuing<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.220> sound

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
more gain or more you queuing and sound

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.880 
more gain or more you queuing and sound
playing<00:01:04.420> through<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.689> 4-12<00:01:05.140> closed-back<00:01:05.590> cab

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
that I've built and I'm playing through

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.520 
that I've built and I'm playing through
the<00:01:10.420> clean<00:01:10.659> side<00:01:10.870> you<00:01:11.020> can<00:01:11.110> hear<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.320> clean

the clean side you can hear the clean
first<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:13.180> wanted<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:13.960> try<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.170> with<00:01:14.320> an<00:01:14.440> EMG

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770
