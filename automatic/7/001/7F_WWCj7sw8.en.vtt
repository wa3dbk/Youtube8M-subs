and I think this model is really great
even<00:03:45.570> though<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.930> livery<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.830> let's<00:03:47.280> say

it's<00:03:48.390> just<00:03:48.750> red<00:03:49.020> invites<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.830> think<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
it's just red invites but I think the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.360 
it's just red invites but I think the
winglets<00:03:50.970> are<00:03:51.210> awesome<00:03:51.980> but<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.040> don't<00:03:53.250> know

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
why they didn't let the winglets like

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.390 
why they didn't let the winglets like
this<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.340> really<00:03:56.820> don't<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.890> ok<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> hope<00:03:59.160> it's
