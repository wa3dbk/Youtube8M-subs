00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.890
 greet you my blog visitors 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 or youtube channel today will tell you 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:16.020
 how to pump 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.890
 ciss more precisely how to download ink on the side 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.919
 inkpots and how to remove the air from the plume 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.480
 I think that with this problem 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.779
 faced a lot of owners 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.930
 printers on which Epson installed 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930
 snpch 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.149
 so for this we need the usual 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 syringe 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.679
 will answer us in plume there is air and in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 Inkwell Inkwell 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:53.159
 translucent we can see that she 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.929
 half full world and syringe 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.929
 without needle without nozzles 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.140
 development insert all the way into the hole 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.080
 which is inserted printing nozzle 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.880
 head and pull the syringe the syringe plunger on 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 myself 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 what do you ink show better and better come out 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.979
 air 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.770
 you can syringe slightly shake this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 hole that's how i did these 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.360
 the ink went to the procedure is repeated until 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.049
 until 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 syringe and will not appear black 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.060
 I would almost like to say briefly why 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 it all happens it happens because 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.609
 that in time any snpch starts 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 suck the air either in place 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.750
 connections with printheads 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:56.369
 heads either together plume connections and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.469
 ink block but the air gets into 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.049
 the inkwell and with time can be 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:07.310
 situation when in the ink 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.100
 there is practically no air for tourists 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.360
 accordingly, we have not quality 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.970
 print want 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 the print head seems to be normal and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.140
 not dried 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.080
 and therefore here is such a periodical 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.900
 the procedure must be carried out but 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.370
 or at least make sure that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.390
 the inkwell is what I think this video 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.650
 help someone 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:43.330
 nothing complicated there is no principle all see 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.050
 the air is gone and plume and chernin azipol 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.590
 wish you luck 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 all the best
