00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.350
 the German economy is doing well the freight traffic will continue to grow 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.500
 By the year 2025, by 70 percent, all modes of transport must be in the future 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.509
 Together they can afford even more inland waterway rail 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.829
 and 2 streets 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.699
 the road will carry the lion's share one way around the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.999
 Making road transport even more efficient is the long truck 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.329
 he can transport up to 50% more than a normal truck there 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.149
 everything develops the higher volume what if the night in the terminals 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.789
 Hammelburg will be 17 pitches more amounts, more Villingen higher 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.550
 Have flexibility in our lines 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.390
 to go further, so we do not go twice to a location with two 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.900
 he certainly had to but only with a truck 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.750
 What was especially important was that drivers problems in the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.770
 In the next few years more and more culminating the end itself and ecological 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.600
 and certainly that over very important in the two years truck 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 can transport the same volume as three conventional ones 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.980
 while a normal semitrailer has 34 pallet spaces 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.730
 a country truck can load up to 53 talents 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.470
 the concept is very simple 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.619
 Three conventional trucks become two long-trucks 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.180
 all elements are compatible 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.410
 the strongest argument fuel consumption and co2 emissions decline 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.230
 14 pallets over 100 kilometers, a long truck needs only about seven liters 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 diesel 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.000
 At least 20 percent of fuel is saved so long trucks are really over 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.920
 the gate 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.170
 Long trucks also give a good picture on the roads 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.329
 they are at most six feet fifty longer than conventional trucks 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.530
 width and height remain the same for the car driver changes on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.540
 Appearance so little something some land truck drivers would even one more 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.610
 Go further 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.060
 a normal car was or road user Belgrader Gaga with 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.680
 poker 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 unless it is not just from one side then you try it 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.919
 otherwise could 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 Whether competition has been taken off the market 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.279
 we have recognized how large distribution centers should be and provide companies as 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.839
 connect with each other 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.449
 they were not meant for supermarkets or the protesters had 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.599
 to supply in the city center 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.599
 Smaller trucks can be uni-live much better 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 The territory of the long-truck are the highways 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.849
 By 2012, the federal government will create a total of 11 thousand new ones 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.869
 truck parking 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.879
 The question of parking spaces for long-distance trucks can not be solved either 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:57.119
 just overtaking a long truck will not be more difficult for car drivers 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.779
 the overtaking process there is only slightly longer than with an ordinary truck 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.869
 despite their size, a truck will not have any trouble if they 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.319
 exceptionally off the highways are traveling 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.969
 they keep all the requirements a cutting course 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.449
 in more precise 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.449
 Turn right and left is possible without further ado 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.359
 Roundabouts are also good at driving through long-distance trucks 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.359
 supple 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.339
 to honor 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.429
 Our infrastructure is even less burdening on long-trucks than conventional ones 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.009
 truck 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.119
 because the total weight is distributed over more hocks 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.999
 For ordinary trucks, the weight is limited to a maximum of five axles 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.869
 in contrast, the long truck is 7 to 8 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.489
 a study of the Federal Highway Research Institute proves that the 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.489
 Infrastructure is thereby spared 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.299
 the drivers are professionals they must know their reliability 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.080
 the practice has shown 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.220
 that they are at the wheel of a small truck feel comfortable the son or lesbian 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.220
 or question that Europe belongs 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.520
 the long-truck and the railroad 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.689
 both will be Egner partners in the future 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.789
 The modules of the long truck are designed so that they can run smoothly 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.789
 Loading wagons 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.580
 that is why the German railway has welcomed that the long corner now in 

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:53.909
 a nationwide 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.909
 Field trial to be tested 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.270
 October 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.560
 Trucks are one way traffic growth in the next few years 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.189
 better to deal with 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.900
 and they also help with climate protection 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 a chance we should use
