00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
easy way to do this is gluing a line

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750 
easy way to do this is gluing a line
down<00:02:34.320> all<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> popsicle<00:02:35.130> sticks<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.490> both

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
down all the popsicle sticks on both

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.520 
down all the popsicle sticks on both
sides<00:02:40.880> if<00:02:41.880> put<00:02:42.209> glue<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.750> both<00:02:42.959> sides<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
sides if put glue on both sides of the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.590 
sides if put glue on both sides of the
structure<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.490> need<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> add<00:02:44.940> popsicle

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
structure you need to add popsicle

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.650 
structure you need to add popsicle
sticks<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:50.270> basically<00:02:51.270> what<00:02:51.480> we're

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
sticks like so basically what we're

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.350 
sticks like so basically what we're
doing<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:52.110> doing<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.670> sealing<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.120> we've

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
doing is doing the sealing that we've

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.510 
doing is doing the sealing that we've
already<00:02:54.600> made<00:02:54.930> again<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.950> will<00:02:59.160> help<00:02:59.370> make

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
already made again this will help make

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.490 
already made again this will help make
the<00:02:59.670> structure<00:03:00.060> more<00:03:00.269> sturdy<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.840> looked

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the structure more sturdy and looked

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:23.940 
the structure more sturdy and looked
more<00:03:01.769> attractive

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.610 

if<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.879> have<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> bent<00:03:25.390> popsicle<00:03:26.020> stick<00:03:26.260> make

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
if you have a bent popsicle stick make

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.650 
if you have a bent popsicle stick make
sure<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.580> take<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.940> out<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.090> replace<00:03:28.629> it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
sure that you take it out and replace it

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:46.770 
sure that you take it out and replace it
with<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> straight<00:03:29.410> one

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.170 

you<00:03:47.740> can<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:48.130> we've<00:03:48.340> had<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.700> do<00:03:48.819> this<00:03:49.000> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
you can see we've had to do this a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.199 
you can see we've had to do this a
couple<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.600> times<00:03:53.550> now<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.850> have<00:03:55.030> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
couple of times now that you have the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.050 
couple of times now that you have the
layer<00:03:55.390> finished<00:03:56.400> you're<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.910> make

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
layer finished you're going to make

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.650 
layer finished you're going to make
another<00:03:58.360> layer<00:03:58.690> by<00:03:59.230> gluing<00:03:59.770> on<00:03:59.920> both<00:04:00.130> sides

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
another layer by gluing on both sides

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:17.270 
another layer by gluing on both sides
subtracting<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:02.020> two<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.530> ends

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:45.749 

once<00:04:18.280> again<00:04:18.400> make<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> new<00:04:19.419> layer

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.999 

once<00:04:46.759> again<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:47.419> had<00:04:47.599> to<00:04:47.780> take<00:04:48.229> out<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.500> bent

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
once again we had to take out a bent

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:56.230 
once again we had to take out a bent
popsicle<00:04:49.580> stick<00:04:53.289> it<00:04:54.400> might<00:04:55.400> make<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.729> project

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
popsicle stick it might make the project

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.999 
popsicle stick it might make the project
more<00:04:56.479> difficult<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:57.259> in<00:04:57.409> the<00:04:57.560> end<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.949> just

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
more difficult but in the end it just

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:11.260 
more difficult but in the end it just
makes<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.610> look<00:04:58.819> better

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.050 

now<00:05:12.270> you're<00:05:12.510> going<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.660> repeat<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.230> process

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
now you're going to repeat this process

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.700 
now you're going to repeat this process
subtracting<00:05:15.060> two<00:05:15.450> popsicle<00:05:15.870> sticks<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.380> both

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
subtracting two popsicle sticks on both

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.930 
subtracting two popsicle sticks on both
sides<00:05:17.060> until<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.450> come<00:05:18.690> up<00:05:18.870> with<00:05:19.080> one

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
sides until you come up with one

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.730 
sides until you come up with one
individual<00:05:20.940> popsicles<00:05:21.570> -<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> shape<00:05:22.380> of<00:05:22.590> the

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
individual popsicles - in a shape of the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.710 
individual popsicles - in a shape of the
log<00:05:22.920> cabin<00:05:22.950> now<00:05:23.820> all<00:05:24.120> that's<00:05:24.240> left<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.660> to

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
log cabin now all that's left is to

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.470 
log cabin now all that's left is to
decorate<00:05:25.260> but<00:05:25.800> before<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.250> do<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:26.670> you<00:05:27.300> might

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
decorate but before you do so you might

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.970 
decorate but before you do so you might
want<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.720> straighten<00:05:27.930> everything<00:05:28.110> out<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
want to straighten everything out to

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.820 
want to straighten everything out to
your<00:05:29.100> final<00:05:29.490> shape<00:05:33.290> you<00:05:34.290> can<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.650> we're

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
your final shape you can see we're

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.450 
your final shape you can see we're
making<00:05:35.130> everything<00:05:35.400> even<00:05:36.980> we<00:05:37.980> will<00:05:38.130> be<00:05:38.280> back
