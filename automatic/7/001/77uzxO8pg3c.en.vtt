00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.729 

so<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.480> first<00:02:13.840> thing<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.290> we're<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739

so the first thing that we're going to
look<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.129> today<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.900> making<00:02:16.900> sure<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.590> your

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
look at today is making sure that your

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.309 
look at today is making sure that your
sewing<00:02:18.129> machine<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.819> threaded<00:02:19.299> correctly

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
sewing machine is threaded correctly

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.649 
sewing machine is threaded correctly
make<00:02:22.099> sure<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.670> thread<00:02:23.000> doesn't<00:02:23.450> come

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
make sure that the thread doesn't come

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.809 
make sure that the thread doesn't come
out<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.349> little<00:02:24.769> eyelet<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.609> make<00:02:25.790> sure

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
out of this little eyelet so make sure

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.990 
out of this little eyelet so make sure
it<00:02:26.060> pulls<00:02:26.329> up<00:02:26.510> through<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.549> good<00:02:28.549> indicator

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
it pulls up through and good indicator

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300 
it pulls up through and good indicator
if<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.420> comes<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.989> thread<00:02:30.230> comes<00:02:30.530> loose<00:02:30.920> out

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
if it comes the thread comes loose out

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.520 
if it comes the thread comes loose out
of<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.359> will<00:02:32.510> give<00:02:32.659> joy<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:32.989> looping

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
of this that you will give joy a looping

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
of this that you will give joy a looping
underneath<00:02:34.069> your<00:02:34.280> quilt<00:02:34.579> but<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.909> won't<00:02:35.120> see

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
underneath your quilt but you won't see

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.479 
underneath your quilt but you won't see
till<00:02:35.840> after<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.319> get<00:02:36.469> done<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.010> row<00:02:37.189> or

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
till after you get done with the row or

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.990 
till after you get done with the row or
it's<00:02:38.209> very<00:02:38.359> nice<00:02:39.079> tension<00:02:40.069> on<00:02:40.250> top<00:02:40.579> of<00:02:40.849> your

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
it's very nice tension on top of your

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.149 
it's very nice tension on top of your
quilt<00:02:41.269> top<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.230> know<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.680> something's

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
quilt top so you know that something's

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.179 
quilt top so you know that something's
going<00:02:43.549> on<00:02:44.439> something<00:02:45.439> else<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.920> have<00:02:46.040> to

going on something else you have to

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.179 
going on something else you have to
check<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.790> Lin<00:02:47.269> that's<00:02:47.689> built<00:02:48.079> up<00:02:48.319> inside<00:02:48.769> your

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
check is Lin that's built up inside your

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.000 
check is Lin that's built up inside your
bobbin<00:02:49.519> Casey<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:50.569> only<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.139> inside<00:02:51.590> but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
bobbin Casey not only in the inside but

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.089 
bobbin Casey not only in the inside but
around<00:02:52.430> right<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:53.599> in<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.439> little<00:02:54.680> shaft

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
around right here in this little shaft

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.479 
around right here in this little shaft
piece<00:02:55.549> if<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.209> take<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.569> pin<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.409> put<00:02:58.370> it

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
piece if you take a pin and you put it

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.289 
piece if you take a pin and you put it
in<00:02:58.670> like<00:02:59.000> this

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
in like this

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.990 
in like this
and<00:02:59.840> pull<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.349> up<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.159> can<00:03:01.400> make<00:03:01.519> sure<00:03:01.579> that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
and pull it up you can make sure that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.649 
and pull it up you can make sure that
the<00:03:02.209> lint<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.859> comes<00:03:03.859> out<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:04.939> just<00:03:05.239> put<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.540> in

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
the lint and comes out so just put it in

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.620 
the lint and comes out so just put it in
like<00:03:05.689> this<00:03:06.079> pull<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.189> out

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.120 

so<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.870> next<00:03:12.140> thing<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.680> want<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> make

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
so the next thing that we want to make

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.550 
so the next thing that we want to make
sure<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.640> we're<00:03:13.850> checking<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.630> our<00:03:15.080> bobbin

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
sure that we're checking is our bobbin

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.430 
sure that we're checking is our bobbin
and<00:03:15.710> our<00:03:15.830> bobbin<00:03:16.160> case<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.060> bobbin<00:03:17.810> will<00:03:18.230> be

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and our bobbin case the bobbin will be

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440 
and our bobbin case the bobbin will be
put<00:03:18.920> into<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.340> bobbin<00:03:19.520> case<00:03:19.730> where<00:03:20.270> the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
put into the bobbin case where the

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.540 
put into the bobbin case where the
thread<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.810> coming<00:03:21.380> up<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.770> right<00:03:22.160> side

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
thread is coming up to the right side

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.660 
thread is coming up to the right side
and<00:03:23.000> going<00:03:23.630> into<00:03:23.990> your<00:03:24.320> bobbin<00:03:24.680> case<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.640> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
and going into your bobbin case so that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.690 
and going into your bobbin case so that
it<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.300> running<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.200> thread<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.340> clockwise

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
it is running the thread in a clockwise

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.490 
it is running the thread in a clockwise
position<00:03:29.360> as<00:03:30.020> it's<00:03:30.680> coming<00:03:30.950> out

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920 

okay<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.910> next<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.450> we're<00:03:36.690> going

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
okay so the next thing that we're going

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.080 
okay so the next thing that we're going
to<00:03:37.110> check<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:37.770> make<00:03:38.190> sure<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.850> thread

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
to check is to make sure that the thread

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.020 
to check is to make sure that the thread
is<00:03:39.300> coming<00:03:39.540> out<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.320> bobbin<00:03:40.710> case<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.220> at

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
is coming out of the bobbin case and at

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.170 
is coming out of the bobbin case and at
the<00:03:42.300> right<00:03:42.540> or<00:03:42.750> correct<00:03:43.380> tension<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.700> when<00:03:45.000> you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the right or correct tension so when you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.870 
the right or correct tension so when you
pull<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.630> thread<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.980> comes<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.640> of

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
pull the thread if it comes up out of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.970 
pull the thread if it comes up out of
your<00:03:48.030> hand<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.570> will<00:03:49.080> roll<00:03:49.290> freely<00:03:49.650> and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
your hand and will roll freely and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.940 
your hand and will roll freely and
doesn't<00:03:50.580> come<00:03:50.850> up<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.750> your<00:03:51.900> hand<00:03:52.200> then

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
doesn't come up out of your hand then

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.910 
doesn't come up out of your hand then
it's<00:03:53.220> rolling<00:03:53.640> correctly<00:03:54.300> if<00:03:54.570> by<00:03:55.170> chance<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
it's rolling correctly if by chance it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.030 
it's rolling correctly if by chance it
comes<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.580> off<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.630> hand<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.170> you're

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
comes up off of your hand as you're

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.430 
comes up off of your hand as you're
pulling<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.670> thread<00:04:00.000> then<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.990> tension

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
pulling on the thread then the tension

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.130 
pulling on the thread then the tension
is<00:04:01.590> too<00:04:01.800> tight<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.360> tension<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.840> too<00:04:04.110> loose

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
is too tight if the tension is too loose

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.340 
is too tight if the tension is too loose
then<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.100> won't<00:04:05.400> be<00:04:05.550> able<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.850> pull<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.360> up<00:04:06.570> so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
then you won't be able to pull it up so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.420 
then you won't be able to pull it up so
it's<00:04:07.530> standing<00:04:08.070> up<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.459> your<00:04:08.730> hand<00:04:10.220> okay<00:04:11.220> so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's standing up in your hand okay so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.550 
it's standing up in your hand okay so
then<00:04:11.790> we're<00:04:12.060> going<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.390> put<00:04:12.600> our<00:04:12.870> bobbin<00:04:13.320> case

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
then we're going to put our bobbin case

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.949 
then we're going to put our bobbin case
into<00:04:13.980> our<00:04:14.100> sewing<00:04:14.370> machine<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.750> going

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
into our sewing machine and we're going

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.870 
into our sewing machine and we're going
to<00:04:16.049> check<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.380> tension<00:04:16.950> as<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.459> comes<00:04:17.670> up

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
to check the tension as it comes up

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.270 
to check the tension as it comes up
through<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.600> fabric<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:20.040> make<00:04:20.250> sure

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
through the fabric so just make sure

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.270 
through the fabric so just make sure
when<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:20.700> push<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.120> down<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.930> your<00:04:22.650> bobbin

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
when you push it down to your bobbin

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.550 
when you push it down to your bobbin
case<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.240> sewing<00:04:24.510> machine<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.170> you<00:04:25.320> hear

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
case in the sewing machine that you hear

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070 
case in the sewing machine that you hear
it<00:04:25.650> pop<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.400> that's<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.419> very<00:04:27.660> important

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
it pop and that's a very important

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.500 
it pop and that's a very important
sounded<00:04:28.530> listen<00:04:29.100> for<00:04:29.400> otherwise<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.390> won't

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
sounded listen for otherwise you won't

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.350 
sounded listen for otherwise you won't
know<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.230> seated<00:04:31.500> incorrectly<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.669> it

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
know that it's seated incorrectly and it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.270 
know that it's seated incorrectly and it
will<00:04:33.480> come<00:04:33.720> out<00:04:33.870> as<00:04:34.260> you're<00:04:34.530> sewing<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.160> you

know<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.730> happens<00:04:36.210> because<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.690> can

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
know what that happens because that can

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.550

Thanks needle and you'll see that it's

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.490 
Thanks needle and you'll see that it's
coming<00:04:49.979> through<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.460> fabric<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:51.150> now<00:04:52.050> we're

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
coming through the fabric and now we're

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.950 
coming through the fabric and now we're
going<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.830> pull<00:04:53.370> our<00:04:53.850> thread<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.419> make<00:04:54.600> sure

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
going to pull our thread to make sure

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.830 
going to pull our thread to make sure
that<00:04:55.590> our<00:04:55.919> bobbin<00:04:56.610> isn't<00:04:57.150> by<00:04:57.330> some<00:04:57.600> chance

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
that our bobbin isn't by some chance

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.980 
that our bobbin isn't by some chance
warped<00:04:58.800> or<00:04:59.040> there's<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.880> little<00:05:00.180> dent<00:05:00.450> in<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.840> or

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
warped or there's a little dent in it or

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.700 
warped or there's a little dent in it or
something<00:05:01.229> like<00:05:01.380> that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
something like that

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.950 
something like that
and<00:05:01.890> how<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:02.400> can<00:05:02.760> tell<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.270> when<00:05:03.780> you're

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
and how you can tell is when you're

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.250 
and how you can tell is when you're
pulling<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:05.160> will<00:05:05.370> feel<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.850> tugging<00:05:06.300> inside

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
pulling you will feel it tugging inside

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.980 
pulling you will feel it tugging inside
the<00:05:07.440> case<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.130> right<00:05:08.700> now<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:08.910> can't<00:05:09.390> feel<00:05:09.720> any

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the case and right now I can't feel any

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.740 
the case and right now I can't feel any
tugging<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.130> seems<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.820> be<00:05:11.970> really<00:05:12.390> smooth

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
tugging so it seems to be really smooth

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.350 
tugging so it seems to be really smooth
and<00:05:13.110> working<00:05:13.470> really<00:05:13.620> well<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:14.669> just<00:05:15.000> make

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
and working really well so just make

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.930 
and working really well so just make
sure<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.930> check<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.700> before<00:05:17.700> you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
sure that you check that before you

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.120 
sure that you check that before you
start<00:05:18.300> sewing<00:05:18.600> on<00:05:19.050> your<00:05:19.080> foot

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.620 

so<00:05:24.130> what<00:05:24.370> we're<00:05:24.550> trying<00:05:24.730> to<00:05:24.940> do<00:05:25.180> with<00:05:25.450> now

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
so what we're trying to do with now

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.330 
so what we're trying to do with now
we're<00:05:25.870> going<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.170> check<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.530> tension<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:27.220> our

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
we're going to check the tension for our

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.370 
we're going to check the tension for our
top<00:05:27.640> thread<00:05:27.970> now<00:05:28.540> that<00:05:28.720> we've<00:05:28.870> checked<00:05:29.110> the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
top thread now that we've checked the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.920 
top thread now that we've checked the
bottom<00:05:29.740> tension<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.460> we<00:05:31.270> want<00:05:31.540> to<00:05:31.720> make<00:05:31.900> sure

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
bottom tension and we want to make sure

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.590 
bottom tension and we want to make sure
that<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.560> knot<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:33.130> coming<00:05:33.640> up<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.150> center

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
that the knot is coming up in the center

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.820 
that the knot is coming up in the center
and<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:35.200> way<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.500> do<00:05:35.860> this<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.930> tighten

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
and the way to do this is to to tighten

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.740 
and the way to do this is to to tighten
your<00:05:38.980> tension<00:05:39.460> just<00:05:39.490> enough<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.450> you<00:05:40.540> can

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
your tension just enough that you can

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.740 
your tension just enough that you can
barely<00:05:41.170> see<00:05:41.830> your<00:05:42.490> bottom<00:05:42.790> thread<00:05:43.330> come

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
barely see your bottom thread come

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.110 
barely see your bottom thread come
through<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.170> your<00:05:44.320> top<00:05:44.530> now<00:05:45.100> we're<00:05:45.340> using<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
through to your top now we're using the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.510 
through to your top now we're using the
the<00:05:46.600> orange<00:05:46.990> thread<00:05:47.350> so<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.220> we<00:05:48.340> can

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
the orange thread so that we can

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.180 
the orange thread so that we can
demonstrate<00:05:48.700> this<00:05:49.270> so<00:05:49.900> I'm<00:05:50.170> going<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.560> tighten

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190

demonstrate this so I'm going to tighten
my<00:05:51.340> tension<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.420> little<00:05:53.110> bit<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.380> don't

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
my tension just a little bit you don't

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.560 
my tension just a little bit you don't
want<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.800> tighten<00:05:53.950> it<00:05:54.190> too<00:05:54.370> much<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.880> then<00:05:55.420> I'm

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
want to tighten it too much and then I'm

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.870 
want to tighten it too much and then I'm
going<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:55.960> run<00:05:56.260> my<00:05:56.410> stitches<00:05:56.950> just<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.640> make

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
going to run my stitches just to make

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.790

through on top just a little bit and as
I<00:06:03.400> go<00:06:03.580> across<00:06:05.730> you'll<00:06:06.730> notice<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:07.780> can

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.710 
barely see it so now I want to turn the
tension<00:06:11.950> back<00:06:12.340> towards<00:06:12.970> me<00:06:13.180> which<00:06:13.480> will

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
tension back towards me which will

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.170 
tension back towards me which will
loosen<00:06:14.200> it<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.590> I<00:06:15.340> want<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.670> turn<00:06:15.880> it<00:06:15.940> in

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
loosen it and I want to turn it in

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.270 
loosen it and I want to turn it in
increments<00:06:16.540> so<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.230> I<00:06:17.260> can<00:06:17.500> get<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.770> tension

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
increments so that I can get the tension

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.990 
increments so that I can get the tension
just<00:06:18.310> right<00:06:19.320> and<00:06:20.580> then<00:06:21.580> I'll<00:06:21.730> keep<00:06:21.940> checking

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
just right and then I'll keep checking

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.720 
just right and then I'll keep checking
it<00:06:22.570> so<00:06:22.780> I<00:06:22.810> don't<00:06:23.200> see<00:06:23.530> any<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.250> orange<00:06:24.580> at

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
it so I don't see any of the orange at

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.920 
it so I don't see any of the orange at
all<00:06:24.880> and<00:06:25.240> this<00:06:26.110> will<00:06:26.440> help<00:06:26.710> us<00:06:26.860> make<00:06:27.150> sure<00:06:28.150> that

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
all and this will help us make sure that

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.370 
all and this will help us make sure that
our<00:06:28.990> tension<00:06:29.650> is<00:06:29.830> just<00:06:29.910> right<00:06:30.910> and<00:06:31.120> even<00:06:31.540> so<00:06:32.350> I

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
our tension is just right and even so I

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.160 
our tension is just right and even so I
need<00:06:32.710> to<00:06:32.830> loosen<00:06:33.100> it<00:06:33.340> just<00:06:33.700> a<00:06:33.880> tad<00:06:34.420> because<00:06:35.050> I

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
need to loosen it just a tad because I

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:42.690 
need to loosen it just a tad because I
can<00:06:35.320> still<00:06:35.680> barely<00:06:36.190> see<00:06:36.730> the<00:06:36.970> orange<00:06:41.430> and<00:06:42.430> now

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
can still barely see the orange and now

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.910 
can still barely see the orange and now
I<00:06:42.760> have<00:06:43.180> it<00:06:43.360> where<00:06:43.600> I<00:06:43.840> can't<00:06:44.260> even<00:06:44.440> see<00:06:44.770> the

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
I have it where I can't even see the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.040 
I have it where I can't even see the
orange<00:06:45.220> at<00:06:45.340> all<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:45.700> when<00:06:46.240> I<00:06:46.270> take<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.780> quilt

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
orange at all and when I take the quilt

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.050 
orange at all and when I take the quilt
off<00:06:47.260> if<00:06:47.500> there<00:06:47.800> is<00:06:47.980> not<00:06:48.190> such<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.520> little<00:06:48.910> bit

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
off if there is not such a little bit

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.230 
off if there is not such a little bit
then<00:06:49.690> it<00:06:50.080> will<00:06:50.350> defect<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:51.220> fibers<00:06:51.940> of<00:06:51.970> the

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
then it will defect the fibers of the

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.600 
then it will defect the fibers of the
fabric<00:06:52.270> will<00:06:52.900> relax<00:06:53.290> and<00:06:53.770> you<00:06:54.190> won't<00:06:54.370> be<00:06:54.490> able

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
fabric will relax and you won't be able

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.110 
fabric will relax and you won't be able
to<00:06:54.850> see<00:06:55.030> any<00:06:55.300> of<00:06:55.510> it<00:06:55.720> whatsoever<00:06:56.280> so<00:06:57.280> I<00:06:57.550> hope

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
to see any of it whatsoever so I hope
