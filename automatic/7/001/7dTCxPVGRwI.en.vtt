00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 good in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:25.550
 how is it that I stick the tips in the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.950
 little fingers of practice like this one that has 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.720
 the nail a little more normal but also 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.460
 I'm going to show you in the other types of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.870
 crimes that are a little stranger 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.640
 well I start with a file and it can be 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.230
 any one that is already used as 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.829
 this does not matter because we are not 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.710
 using on a little finger of a person and what 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.140
 I do to remove the brightness to make 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.489
 the most porous area and so you can 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 absorb the glue better and so this one 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.460
 can stay better adhered to the nail 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.579
 of the type 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.430
 and this is the one that I use the omega labs and 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.080
 the nail glue and I apply it after 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.110
 have removed the dust with a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.930
 cepillito applied the glue nothing more 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.240
 in the area of ​​smile pressed in the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.280
 practice little finger area and you have to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 press very very well very very strong and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.350
 especially in the corners and 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.590
 hold it and stop it there until 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.740
 is completely dry many people 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.550
 they sent me messages that how to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.580
 do to keep the type and that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.649
 they fall, I recommend this 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.600
 because it's what has helped me 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.700
 expose him later when it's okay 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 stuck another very thin capita of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 glue nothing else in the smile area 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.929
 and with a bag like this, types of plate or 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.479
 something like that or are you where the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.490
 exchanges press very well 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.649
 until it dries 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.390
 Now I 'm going to show you how I stick it 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.729
 one of these crimes that have well 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 as the opening is a bit strange that 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.439
 you look at rare media 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.180
 well I use the type that is complete 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.970
 the one that does not have the smile area 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.539
 cut but the one that covers the nail 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.939
 entire 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.739
 this is the type of tip that I use when 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.829
 I'm going to use it in the crime of practice 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.500
 with the gap and there are two ways a very 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.079
 simple that many are what we use is 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.930
 just put the nail inside and already 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.930
 the bad thing about that is that it easily comes off 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.790
 while you're bordering or while you're 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.609
 doing your design then the other thing 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.560
 what I do is the same to remove the 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.510
 brightness and to make it more porous but 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 also for like flatten it a bit 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.310
 more because I eat that is very boludito 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.079
 this area here and that when I go to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.760
 put the glue me center in area 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:52.879
 central tip and I stick it firmly 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.189
 and I put it well this is just one of 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.560
 the ideas I hope you like it I hope you 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.599
 help and help them make their 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.150
 adhesion of the tip in fingers of 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.220
 practice if you have other methods 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.109
 what have worked for them please 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.760
 comment on it here below and so on 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.409
 we can help and share ideas 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.110
