00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.259
 like the boss you look at the tree 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 do you like that sometimes the iss 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.759
 Visited this my name is floppy today 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 let's talk about a hot topic right now 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.190
 not really current topic but 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.510
 again and again decisive 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:24.180
 Castingshows and their true 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.779
 do more about it right now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 this short break the softies 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.219
 do not need a tor so that continues 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 By the way, the wolf is medium 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.380
 we all scribble and know them 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.140
 madness 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.360
 hello hello of course it is straight 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.760
 Again I just read 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 do we know so all is so wonderful 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 he think I now again a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 decisive or so i haunted it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 not really 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 and there is a small blatant and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 Although there has been an ex ex casting 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 member jesper has this on youtube 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.799
 pretty platform a video 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 published where he against against the 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.619
 casting organization practical rants 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 asks the so word against since 1 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.180
 and against the contract he 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.159
 has signed and they like him 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.119
 but please let out of this contract 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.100
 So many think so when I'm there now 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 I'll go to such a castingshow 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.369
 Famous the fritz text probably 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.979
 there too i will punkrock relation or 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 what i heavy metal the nation or 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.200
 Unfortunately pop pop is usually the mall 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.740
 the nations 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.939
 We all know them and very few 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.610
 However, that's actually known 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.320
 has little to do with them 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.760
 with new company so 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.409
 I am not looking at you now 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 but they are looking for you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.210
 Actually just to make money out 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.490
 That's why there is a profit 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.800
 Of course, only right at the beginning 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.720
 nice fat contract here in this case 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.010
 apparently more than 60 pages and if 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.970
 I really read through it 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.860
 or if you are not really one 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.830
 has a clue of how this pretty gentleman 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.290
 Now bayer had then yes you have one 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.740
 little ass card pulled so one 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.810
 little 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
 because it is all about, of course, about that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.250
 detour comes so little salary 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.260
 is paid during the time that you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.680
 did not really have a say 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.560
 during the show and that was natural 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.480
 the after when you are out there 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 then the thing is not so long ago 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.989
 not over but then it's just 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670
 still neatly continue it 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.450
 tied to certain things 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.400
 label 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.830
 one he can not really do what 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.780
 you want to be so gentleman at the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.640
 apparent security a bit blue-eyed 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.340
 to move on and is natural 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.470
 it shit and of course it is not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 necessarily calls of sat 1 or viruses 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.769
 But that's the reality 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.239
 mean, he could just as easily say 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:00.810
 would not suffice heavy contract 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.519
 through reads and then complains that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 which is practically right and 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.150
 is pulled through the has what he has 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.480
 then fritzl was the three times the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.230
 one pulls card or say 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.780
 on the one hand, of course, you can 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.049
 okay okay but on the other 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.989
 page and sat 1 what else do who 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.910
 Contracts do not read or look like that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.019
 something takes in 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.970
 blame yourself and the net like that 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.430
 my friends spend was i have 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.350
 lost a bet 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.239
 little insider does not pull either 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.000
 really you are not a toy 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.260
 box 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 Ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.380
 I just want to go into the room 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 throw what is actually hold of it 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.160
 fills you even join better 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.840
 or do you want or have you already? 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.210
 once participated in such a casting 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.650
 show stories or much 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.330
 interesting this could the can 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.580
 you answer right away you think 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.890
 really that everything is as nice as 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:58.200
 it really comes across on TV 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:04:01.090
 Everything is made a star 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.560
 behind the man pushed so 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.150
 not soon they would now leave now 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.370
 are there to make us the most money or 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.890
 So the problem is really who with it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 he should actually slow down 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.820
 know how it works 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.239
 how many casting round is it now 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.609
 already yes it does not matter if you are bois de 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.180
 the s or x-factor or like all of them 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.250
 be called 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.630
 the machinery behind it is always the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.220
 same even if it is on tv 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 maybe other fashions are or how 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.900
 whatever or other people think now 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.850
 somehow Xavier Naidoo does it 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.530
 That's why it must be a fair thing 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.030
 his puff cake yes 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.830
 he has nothing to do with it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.169
 whose performer in front of the camera more 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.950
 is not synonymous yes he also has one 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.060
 contract is on the people 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.060
 he is over age-shit 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.570
 flown blatantly that's obviously natural 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.270
 not really with 111 said 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.070
 every issue that you still have one 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.169
 a few stupid people apparently the the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.900
 Shot did not hear caught 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.270
 there are always those denied the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.860
 but now I think that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.000
 chance so I am here in the middle 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.560

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.710

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.090

 we also make plastic visit 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.680
 and there is no big contract 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.180
 It just gets blood 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.530
 signed that we have your soul 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.870

 believe the round we are still to the end 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.220
 maybe we have a few more 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.389
 pretty protective walls I do not cover the whole 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:59.110
