centuries<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> strong<00:00:50.399> toughest

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
centuries these are the strong toughest

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.599 
centuries these are the strong toughest

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
of layer defenses so you shouldn't sit

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.759 
of layer defenses so you shouldn't sit
them<00:00:53.760> together<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.929> they<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.379> air

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
them together so that they get air

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.340

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.330 
after them and come in range at these
defenses<00:01:10.549> also<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.090> want<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.780> your

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
defenses also you want to just put your

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.890 
defenses also you want to just put your
rally<00:01:14.340> flags<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.970> opposite<00:01:15.479> ends<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
rally flags on opposite ends of your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
rally flags on opposite ends of your
base<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.320> set<00:01:17.159> them<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> Patrol<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> they

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
base and set them to Patrol so that they

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.200 
base and set them to Patrol so that they
run<00:01:18.960> back<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.229> forth<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.009> make<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> harder

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
run back and forth and make it harder

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.249 
run back and forth and make it harder
for<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.689> enemy<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.259> decide<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> deploy

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
for the enemy to decide where to deploy

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
for the enemy to decide where to deploy
also<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.680> research<00:01:25.920> station<00:01:26.790> which

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
also you get your research station which

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
also you get your research station which
make<00:01:27.689> sure<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.409> want<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.610> can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
make sure if you want to you can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.120 
make sure if you want to you can
research<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.479> base<00:01:33.479> defenses<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.979> can

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
research the the base defenses you can

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.510 
research the the base defenses you can
research<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> commandos<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> want

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
research the commandos up if you want

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.069 
research the commandos up if you want
which<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:38.909> idea<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.750> stronger

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
which is a good idea make them stronger

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
which is a good idea make them stronger
that<00:01:40.350> makes<00:01:40.649> them<00:01:40.770> tougher<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.310> kill<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> then

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that makes them tougher to kill and then

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
that makes them tougher to kill and then
makes<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.750> kill<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.469> enemies<00:01:43.710> faster<00:01:44.219> too

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
makes them kill your enemies faster too

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.639 
makes them kill your enemies faster too
so<00:01:46.130> besides<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.899> make<00:01:48.899> sure<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> upgrade

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so besides that make sure to upgrade

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.249 
so besides that make sure to upgrade
your<00:01:49.829> guard<00:01:50.039> towers<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.570> sentry<00:01:52.049> guns

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
your guard towers and your sentry guns

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
your guard towers and your sentry guns
to<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:53.130> level<00:01:53.520> 4<00:01:54.469> I<00:01:55.469> do<00:01:55.770> believe<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.579> this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
to around level 4 I do believe that this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
to around level 4 I do believe that this
is<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.659> will<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.110> important<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:59.840> enemies

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is an this will be important as enemies

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920 
is an this will be important as enemies
with<00:02:01.020> tanks<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.030> harder<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.270> kill<00:02:03.479> units

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
with tanks and harder to kill units

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.490 
with tanks and harder to kill units
covering<00:02:04.590> their<00:02:04.829> other<00:02:05.369> good<00:02:05.670> units<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.539> going

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
covering their other good units is going

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.359 
covering their other good units is going
to<00:02:07.649> be

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to be

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
to be
come<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.879> relevant<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.319> level<00:02:10.619> 5

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
come more relevant as you get to level 5

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.380 
come more relevant as you get to level 5
with<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.250> HQ<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:13.349> sure<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.709> do<00:02:13.860> that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
with your HQ so make sure you do that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.160 
with your HQ so make sure you do that
but<00:02:15.390> pretty<00:02:15.629> much<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:17.690> level<00:02:18.690> 5<00:02:18.930> HQ

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
but pretty much that's it level 5 HQ

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
but pretty much that's it level 5 HQ
which<00:02:19.920> will<00:02:20.159> be<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.670> good<00:02:20.730> discussion

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
which will be actually a good discussion

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.100 
which will be actually a good discussion
here<00:02:21.989> we're<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.129> ten<00:02:23.340> more<00:02:23.519> walls

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
here we're going to get ten more walls
