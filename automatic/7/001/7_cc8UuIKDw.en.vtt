00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.660
 McDonaldâ€™s

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.919
 be dedicated to pseudo certification 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.339

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.579
 video certification 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.050
 mcdonalds or great can't 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.939
 today's video will be dedicated 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.769
 the percentage of full certification is nauseous 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.240
 lofts station in the company at home with 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.470
 Russia 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.309
 and also want to explain in passing why not 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.010
 it turns out to challenge the interest in court 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.760
 unit delivered no yes chairman 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.199
 primary trade union 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.030
 organization sapegina th after training 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.309
 KSK start with the fact that the mass of employees 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.190
 purposeful business of delusion about 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.220
 what tiesto is 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.980
 affects 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.640
 in the first certification in the form in which 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760
 spelled out in our law has nothing 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.960
 General if we will be interesting what is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 cyst prices actually you can with this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.470
 familiarize yourself on our union form 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.270
 the topic is called certification 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.680
 what is it 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.300
 in the list everything is described 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.270
 oh how else 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.650
 who is why you and why is it being held at all 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.230
 station 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.490
 but it is also clear that the articles 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.060
 written and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 so this is what it should be 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.270
 secondly, the legal name 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.800
 and our and pseudo certification appraisal 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.520
 performance indicators provide your 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.050
 Attention audio but not so 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.890
 in the recent world cup for conclusions in hong kong 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.899
 due to failure 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.450
 currently in london in its new 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.070
 Orleans 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.220
 it's much more expensive so i tell him 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 I speak 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.480
 when on sale 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 yes such an assessment was such an opportunity 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.410
 truth will be met 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.790
 long time ago 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.840
 recall the day before 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.139
 interest discounts 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.279
 performance itself has long been estimated 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.529
 became a reflection tool 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.179
 An employee of the administration will appear 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.569
 the restaurant 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.519
 or as our administration cases 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.530
 central office with if exactly 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.439
 articulate to us pass that percentage 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.769
 bonuses not for working with but for loyalty but 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.449
 reality principle how does it manifest itself 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.789
 this we forever and ubiquitous 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.589
 silence immaculate 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.199
 performing both adequate and 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.369
 inadequate errands personal 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.359
 agreement with everything and everything as they say and also 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.239
 so 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.779
 indicators can be determined as 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.609
 three times the herd principle 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.819
 work 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.649
 and if you sum up the conclusions of what 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.899
 to the same, our pseudo certification 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.709
 except for the percentage of premiums no longer on 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.139
 which does not affect the outcome of the May OSCE date 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.209
 stations can not dismiss a person 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.339
 not incur no post 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.759
 translate about another restaurant and so on 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.899
 in the end I want to remind you that he 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.809
 bonus programs 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.589
 I remember being created by Moscow time the organization itself 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.329
 and 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.040
 if the company is not the law on trade unions 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.629
 or collective agreement tons 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.669
 challenging but practically percentage 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:27.579
 given 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.569
 program n is impossible even through 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.879
 court 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.029
 but we don't give up now as always 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.040
 Considered translations 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.010
 through quarterly accounting 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.120
 union members premiums but 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.269
 at least so the administration knows in 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.049
 face with ronald mcdonald fund thereby 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.519
 showing your disagreement with this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.329
 bonus programs so for 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.790
 what is it generally accrued to us personally 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.480
 that kind of money is not needed but the funds are all the same 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.289
 useful for helping children 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.019
 finally, as always, I want to wish everyone 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.449
 to remain people 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.179
 m were strong personalities left 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:06.489
 their point of view as they say not 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.529
 rose in a row this is a changeable world 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.909
 basically everything 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.069
 seven paddle number
