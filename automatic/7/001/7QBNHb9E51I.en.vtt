Krakens<00:00:10.200> layer<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> its<00:00:10.830> location<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.580> have

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
Krakens layer and its location I have

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
Krakens layer and its location I have
just<00:00:11.969> charged<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.509> oxygen<00:00:12.690> packs<00:00:13.200> there

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
just charged up my oxygen packs there

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.990 
just charged up my oxygen packs there
I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> head<00:00:14.190> down<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
I'm going to head down and have a bit of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.400 
I'm going to head down and have a bit of
a<00:00:15.089> look<00:00:15.210> around<00:00:15.360> I'm<00:00:15.750> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> dive<00:00:16.199> all

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
a look around I'm going to dive all

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.750 
a look around I'm going to dive all
around<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> spot<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> look

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
around the spot so you can have a look

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.580 
around the spot so you can have a look
at<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> looks<00:00:18.510> like<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.230> supposed<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
at what it looks like it is supposed to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.960 
at what it looks like it is supposed to
be<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> best<00:00:19.920> place<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.400> treasure<00:00:20.580> hunting

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
be the best place for treasure hunting

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.950 
be the best place for treasure hunting
and<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.270> gonna<00:00:21.359> show<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.570> where<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.840> on

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and I'm gonna show you where it is on

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
and I'm gonna show you where it is on
the<00:00:22.050> map<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.640> i<00:00:23.670> am<00:00:23.850> right

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the map so you can see here i am right

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
the map so you can see here i am right
here<00:00:24.330> between<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.990> two<00:00:25.199> islands<00:00:25.890> it's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
here between the two islands it's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.529 
here between the two islands it's
probably<00:00:26.519> not<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> best<00:00:26.789> view<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.269> there

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
probably not the best view just there

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
probably not the best view just there
once<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.349> bring<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> map<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.920> again<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
once I just bring the map up again and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.609 
once I just bring the map up again and
now<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.599> below<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.380> little

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
now you can see just below that little

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
now you can see just below that little
swirl<00:00:31.890> thing<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:33.090> where<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> am<00:00:33.329> there

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
swirl thing there right where I am there

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.080 
swirl thing there right where I am there
so<00:00:34.020> go<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.739> spot<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> swim

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
so go to that spot have a bit of a swim

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
so go to that spot have a bit of a swim
around<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> you'll<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.660> able<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
around and you'll be able to see it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.510 
around and you'll be able to see it
because<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> does<00:00:37.620> stand<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.040> quite<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> bit

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
because it does stand out quite a bit

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
because it does stand out quite a bit
but<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> lot

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
but as you can see there was just a lot

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
but as you can see there was just a lot
of<00:00:40.770> shipwrecks<00:00:41.219> everywhere<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.390> we

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
of shipwrecks everywhere and that is we

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
of shipwrecks everywhere and that is we
supposed<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> find<00:00:43.260> some<00:00:43.620> country<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
supposed to find some country sure but I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
supposed to find some country sure but I
am<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.840> underwater<00:00:46.289> treasure<00:00:46.620> hunter

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
am a bit of a underwater treasure hunter

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
am a bit of a underwater treasure hunter
of<00:00:47.399> enthusiasts<00:00:48.030> myself<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.440> been

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of enthusiasts myself and I have been

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.920 
of enthusiasts myself and I have been
dying<00:00:50.160> over<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> location<00:00:51.059> many<00:00:51.329> times<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
dying over this location many times and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
dying over this location many times and
I<00:00:52.050> haven't<00:00:52.469> managed<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> find<00:00:53.010> any<00:00:53.190> chest

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I haven't managed to find any chest

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.400 
I haven't managed to find any chest
around<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> found<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.629> elsewhere<00:00:54.840> but

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
around here I found them elsewhere but

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.040 
around here I found them elsewhere but
maybe<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.730> overhunted<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.840> I'm

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
maybe it's just over overhunted or I'm

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
maybe it's just over overhunted or I'm
not<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.469> sure<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.579> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
come have a look it is a cool location

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
come have a look it is a cool location
to<00:01:03.149> check<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.860> see

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to check out as well but as you can see

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800 
to check out as well but as you can see
there<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.519> deeper<00:01:05.790> parts<00:01:06.240> there's<00:01:06.510> some

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
there are some deeper parts there's some

there are some deeper parts there's some
other<00:01:06.990> parts<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.350> stick<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.979> definitely

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
other parts of stick out I definitely

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
other parts of stick out I definitely
searched<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> area<00:01:09.000> around<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
searched the area around it as well just

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.870 
searched the area around it as well just
to<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.680> sure<00:01:10.710> who<00:01:11.070> sometimes<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.670> chess

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to make sure who sometimes the chess

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
to make sure who sometimes the chess
aren't<00:01:12.119> directly<00:01:12.540> next<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.409> within<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
aren't directly next to or within the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.679 
aren't directly next to or within the
ruins<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> ship<00:01:15.210> generally<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.659> are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
ruins of the ship generally they are

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
ruins of the ship generally they are
kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> close<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> search

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
kind of close so have a bit of a search

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
kind of close so have a bit of a search
around<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.049> treasure<00:01:19.290> hunting<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
around if you are treasure hunting here
