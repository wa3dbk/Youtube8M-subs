00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.790 
Northwestern and that was kind of the
springboard<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.390> i<00:04:42.660> could<00:04:43.050> see<00:04:43.200> similar<00:04:43.590> thing

with Darryl if Joe decides to go with
him<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.080> just<00:04:46.620> think<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.520> today's<00:04:47.670> college

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
him I just think that in today's college

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.670 
him I just think that in today's college
football<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.660> need<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> mobile<00:04:49.050> quarterback

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
football you need a mobile quarterback

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.340 
football you need a mobile quarterback
to<00:04:50.550> make<00:04:50.730> plays<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.210> third<00:04:51.450> down<00:04:51.690> when<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
to make plays on third down when the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.110 
to make plays on third down when the
defense<00:04:52.740> kind<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.100> takes<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.790> things<00:04:54.000> away

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
defense kind of takes some things away

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.090 
defense kind of takes some things away
or<00:04:54.360> gets<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.630> patch<00:04:54.840> watch<00:04:55.110> going<00:04:55.500> I'm<00:04:55.860> sure

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
or gets the patch watch going I'm sure

Devlin<00:04:56.460> is<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.550> great<00:04:56.760> player<00:04:57.030> but<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.600> really

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
Devlin is a great player but I really

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.570 
Devlin is a great player but I really
think<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.290> it'll<00:04:58.470> be<00:04:58.560> Clark's<00:04:58.890> job<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.340> lose

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
think that it'll be Clark's job to lose

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.850 
think that it'll be Clark's job to lose
maybe<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.510> lose<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.990> maybe<00:05:01.260> Devon<00:05:01.650> will<00:05:01.740> be

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
maybe you lose it maybe Devon will be

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.680 
maybe you lose it maybe Devon will be

order going<00:05:07.260> in<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.830> think<00:05:08.070> Darrell<00:05:08.430> gets

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
order going in I think Darrell gets

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.880 
order going in I think Darrell gets
first<00:05:09.450> shot<00:05:09.870> at<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> job<00:05:10.110> it'll<00:05:10.500> be<00:05:10.590> fun<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
first shot at the job it'll be fun to

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.040 
first shot at the job it'll be fun to
see<00:05:10.950> how<00:05:11.520> they<00:05:11.670> run<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.940> offense<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.020> a

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
see how they run the offense well to a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.800 
see how they run the offense well to a
couple<00:05:13.410> things<00:05:13.670> Clark<00:05:14.670> I'm<00:05:14.970> Devlin<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.540> think

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
couple things Clark I'm Devlin I think

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.440 
couple things Clark I'm Devlin I think
you<00:05:15.900> may<00:05:16.020> be<00:05:16.050> under<00:05:16.640> under<00:05:17.640> estimating<00:05:18.300> his

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
you may be under under estimating his

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.450 
you may be under under estimating his
ability<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.320> run<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.770> ball<00:05:19.919> he's<00:05:20.100> not<00:05:20.280> in

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
ability to run the ball he's not in

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.430 
ability to run the ball he's not in
Clarks<00:05:20.850> league<00:05:21.120> but<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.600> think<00:05:21.900> he<00:05:22.020> is<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.140> mobile

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
Clarks league but I think he is a mobile

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.200 
Clarks league but I think he is a mobile
mobile<00:05:22.830> quarterback<00:05:23.400> people<00:05:23.700> who<00:05:23.760> saw<00:05:24.000> him

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
mobile quarterback people who saw him

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.790 
mobile quarterback people who saw him
down<00:05:24.540> in<00:05:24.600> town<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:24.960> think<00:05:25.080> will<00:05:25.350> tell<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.650> that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800

down in town I think will tell you that
the<00:05:26.250> other<00:05:26.280> thing<00:05:26.520> about<00:05:26.580> Clark<00:05:27.090> though<00:05:27.300> that

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
the other thing about Clark though that

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.540 
the other thing about Clark though that
I<00:05:27.480> don't<00:05:27.660> think<00:05:27.840> we've<00:05:27.960> discussed<00:05:28.410> he<00:05:29.040> really

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
I don't think we've discussed he really

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.580 
I don't think we've discussed he really
is<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.669> dynamic<00:05:29.940> personality<00:05:30.720> yeah<00:05:31.140> this<00:05:31.350> is<00:05:31.560> a

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
just or anybody you know Tony hunt

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.520 
just or anybody you know Tony hunt
anybody<00:05:39.030> on<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.180> offense<00:05:39.390> they<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.290> not

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
anybody on that offense they have not

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.950 
anybody on that offense they have not
had<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:40.830> dynamic<00:05:41.580> personality<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:42.720> think

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
had that dynamic personality and I think

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.720 
had that dynamic personality and I think
that<00:05:43.110> could<00:05:43.290> come<00:05:43.440> into<00:05:43.590> play<00:05:43.680> as<00:05:43.950> well<00:05:44.160> I<00:05:44.340> mean

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
that could come into play as well I mean

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.790 
that could come into play as well I mean
at<00:05:44.880> Penn<00:05:45.120> State<00:05:45.419> I<00:05:45.450> think<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.080> best<00:05:46.440> teams

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
at Penn State I think the best teams

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.280 
at Penn State I think the best teams
have<00:05:47.070> had<00:05:47.100> dynamic<00:05:47.490> quarterbacks<00:05:48.300> you<00:05:49.200> know

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
have had dynamic quarterbacks you know

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.720 
have had dynamic quarterbacks you know
whether<00:05:49.500> it's<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.919> mean<00:05:50.070> personality<00:05:50.610> where

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
whether it's I mean personality where

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.270 
whether it's I mean personality where
the<00:05:50.820> right<00:05:50.970> Shaffer<00:05:51.510> carry<00:05:52.320> calls<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:52.890> extend

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
the right Shaffer carry calls to extend

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.159 
the right Shaffer carry calls to extend
extent<00:05:53.700> Blackledge<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.450> see<00:05:54.600> where<00:05:54.780> he<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.020> now

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
extent Blackledge is see where he is now

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.250 
extent Blackledge is see where he is now
Michael<00:05:55.650> Robinson<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.660> Clark<00:05:57.660> obviously<00:05:58.229> I

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
Michael Robinson and Clark obviously I

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.330 
Michael Robinson and Clark obviously I
mean<00:05:58.470> you<00:05:58.590> talked<00:05:58.770> to<00:05:58.890> him<00:05:59.010> after<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.310> game

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
mean you talked to him after the game

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.520 
mean you talked to him after the game
full<00:06:00.060> of<00:06:00.090> emotion<00:06:00.630> handles<00:06:00.960> himself<00:06:01.110> well

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
full of emotion handles himself well

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.530 
full of emotion handles himself well
with<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.740> media<00:06:02.040> so<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:02.910> think<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.360> could

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
with the media so I think that could

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.969 
with the media so I think that could
come<00:06:03.720> into<00:06:03.840> play<00:06:03.900> as<00:06:04.169> well<00:06:04.290> yeah<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.800> it's

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
come into play as well yeah and it's

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.409 
come into play as well yeah and it's
important<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.520> think<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.910> his<00:06:06.030> teammates

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
important I think that his teammates

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.240 
important I think that his teammates
believe<00:06:06.840> in<00:06:07.050> him<00:06:07.260> especially<00:06:07.560> in<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.010> fourth

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
believe in him especially in the fourth

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.469 
believe in him especially in the fourth
quarter<00:06:08.460> when<00:06:08.669> Michael<00:06:09.030> was<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.210> quarterback

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
quarter when Michael was the quarterback

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.300 
quarter when Michael was the quarterback
when<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.410> game<00:06:10.560> was<00:06:10.590> close<00:06:10.860> i<00:06:11.040> think<00:06:11.220> there

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
when the game was close i think there

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.920 
when the game was close i think there
was<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.430> sense<00:06:11.669> that<00:06:11.850> especially<00:06:12.750> on<00:06:12.840> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
was a sense that especially on the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.050 
was a sense that especially on the
offensive<00:06:12.960> guys<00:06:13.560> figured<00:06:13.950> out<00:06:14.040> our<00:06:14.640> new<00:06:14.880> that

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
offensive guys figured out our new that

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.180 
offensive guys figured out our new that
he<00:06:15.150> would<00:06:15.270> find<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.720> way<00:06:15.750> somehow<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.650> make<00:06:17.010> a

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
he would find a way somehow to make a

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.400 
he would find a way somehow to make a
play<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.729> you<00:06:17.820> know<00:06:18.000> Anthony<00:06:18.930> Morelli<00:06:19.169> has

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
play I you know Anthony Morelli has

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.930 
play I you know Anthony Morelli has
great<00:06:19.650> physical<00:06:20.070> skills<00:06:20.340> but<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.580> just<00:06:20.820> got

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
great physical skills but I just got

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.420 
great physical skills but I just got
this<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.800> perception<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.039> season

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
this the perception of the season

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.190 
this the perception of the season
went<00:06:23.580> on<00:06:23.670> that<00:06:24.090> there<00:06:24.360> wasn't<00:06:24.540> a<00:06:24.720> lot<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:24.900> faith

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
went on that there wasn't a lot of faith

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.320 
went on that there wasn't a lot of faith
in<00:06:25.230> him<00:06:25.680> among<00:06:26.490> his<00:06:26.580> teammates<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.150> maybe

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
in him among his teammates and maybe

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.510 
in him among his teammates and maybe
that<00:06:27.540> wonderful<00:06:28.140> tried<00:06:28.380> to<00:06:29.040> force<00:06:29.310> that

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
that wonderful tried to force that

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.890 
that wonderful tried to force that
against<00:06:29.760> Michigan<00:06:30.180> State<00:06:30.210> late<00:06:30.600> in<00:06:30.690> the<00:06:30.750> game

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
against Michigan State late in the game

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.780
