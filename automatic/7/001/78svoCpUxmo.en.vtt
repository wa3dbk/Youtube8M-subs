we're going to go into another waving

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.630 
we're going to go into another waving
technique<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.170> moment<00:00:16.590> which<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.980> liquid

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
technique at the moment which is liquid

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.970 
technique at the moment which is liquid
I've<00:00:18.330> done<00:00:18.570> hand<00:00:18.869> liquid<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> waiting

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I've done hand liquid and waiting

come<00:00:32.579> back<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> one

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
come back to this one because this one

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
come back to this one because this one
gets<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:33.870> bit<00:00:34.140> more<00:00:34.290> advanced<00:00:34.890> stage

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gets a little bit more advanced stage

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.049 
gets a little bit more advanced stage
one<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.630> technique<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.640> all<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
one for this technique is all in the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.869 
one for this technique is all in the
shoulders<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.879> over

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
shoulders and so we're going to go over

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
shoulders and so we're going to go over
the<00:00:42.000> top<00:00:42.350> practices<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.530> me<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:43.950> also<00:00:44.129> watch

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the top practices with me but also watch

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
the top practices with me but also watch
yourself<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> mirror<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
yourself in a mirror what I want you to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.400 
yourself in a mirror what I want you to
think<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.980> making<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.059> shoulders<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:49.230> as

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
think is making your shoulders look as

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
think is making your shoulders look as
abnormal<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:50.219> possible<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.030> knowing<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
abnormal as possible all you knowing is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
abnormal as possible all you knowing is
so-so<00:00:52.170> circles<00:00:52.770> forward<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> shoulder

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so-so circles forward with that shoulder

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
so-so circles forward with that shoulder
like<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.840> yeah<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.070> from<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.370> angle<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
like this yeah but from this angle going

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.869 
like this yeah but from this angle going
one<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.989> starting<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> other<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.579> try

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
one then starting the other really try

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
one then starting the other really try
to<00:00:59.910> open<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> technique<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to open them up the technique of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
to open them up the technique of
rotating<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.090> socket<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.080> right

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
rotating in your socket to get right

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.580 
rotating in your socket to get right
down<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.549> shape<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.990> important

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
down into this shape is really important

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
down into this shape is really important
so<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> mean<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.760> rotating<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.479> like

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
so what I mean by rotating is like

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
so what I mean by rotating is like
rotating<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.380> arm<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> little

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
rotating that arm to get it that little

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
rotating that arm to get it that little
bit<00:01:12.119> further<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.650> rotate<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
bit further down so really rotate and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.719 
bit further down so really rotate and
get<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> circle<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.350> whole<00:01:16.590> way<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get that circle the whole way around so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310 
get that circle the whole way around so
play<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> technique<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.049> bit

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
play with that technique a little bit

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
play with that technique a little bit
just<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> shoulders<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:21.060> me<00:01:21.270> check<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just with the shoulders with me check in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.370 
just with the shoulders with me check in
the<00:01:22.049> mirror<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.979> move<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.840> you've

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the mirror and then move on so you've

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
the mirror and then move on so you've
got<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> shoulder<00:01:26.040> circles<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.570> all

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
got the shoulder circles from there all

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
got the shoulder circles from there all
you<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.799> add<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you want to do is add that little bit of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
you want to do is add that little bit of
weight<00:01:30.689> okay<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.280> those<00:01:32.520> shoulders

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
weight okay so with those shoulders

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.899 
weight okay so with those shoulders
starting<00:01:33.420> each<00:01:33.630> wave<00:01:34.250> separately<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.759> go

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
starting each wave separately you can go

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
starting each wave separately you can go
forward<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.570> backwards<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.500> shoulders

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
forward or backwards with your shoulders

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
forward or backwards with your shoulders
whatever<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:39.079> what<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> to
