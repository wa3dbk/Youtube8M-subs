newer diopter the nada cam engineered
specifically<00:00:26.050> for<00:00:26.349> underwater<00:00:26.710> use<00:00:27.099> this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
specifically for underwater use this

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.900 
specifically for underwater use this
diopter<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:29.109> strongest<00:00:29.650> macro<00:00:30.400> diopter

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910

that's<00:00:31.090> available<00:00:31.359> right<00:00:31.689> now<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.410> what<00:00:32.980> sets

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
that's available right now and what sets

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040 
that's available right now and what sets
it<00:00:33.400> apart<00:00:33.489> from<00:00:33.790> some<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.390> other<00:00:34.600> macro

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
it apart from some of the other macro

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.799 
it apart from some of the other macro
diopters<00:00:35.590> out<00:00:35.800> there<00:00:36.129> is<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:37.570> was

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
diopters out there is that it was

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.619 
diopters out there is that it was
designed<00:00:38.230> with<00:00:38.589> specific<00:00:39.129> underwater<00:00:40.089> optics

designed with specific underwater optics

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.860 
designed with specific underwater optics
in<00:00:40.839> mind<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:41.830> it<00:00:42.220> was<00:00:42.400> engineered<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.180> maintain

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
in mind so it was engineered to maintain

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.469 
in mind so it was engineered to maintain
super<00:00:44.559> sharp<00:00:44.979> corner<00:00:45.430> sharpness<00:00:45.760> which<00:00:46.239> is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
super sharp corner sharpness which is

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.299 
super sharp corner sharpness which is
one<00:00:46.750> thing<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.080> lose<00:00:47.290> with<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.559> lot<00:00:47.769> of<00:00:47.799> macro

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
one thing you lose with a lot of macro

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.000 
one thing you lose with a lot of macro
converters<00:00:48.909> underwater<00:00:49.390> as<00:00:49.659> well<00:00:50.409> as<00:00:50.650> to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
converters underwater as well as to

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.060 
converters underwater as well as to
limit<00:00:51.369> or<00:00:51.580> avoid<00:00:51.970> all<00:00:52.690> chromatic<00:00:53.350> aberration

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
limit or avoid all chromatic aberration

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.430 
limit or avoid all chromatic aberration
with<00:00:55.000> such<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.239> strong<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.720> opted<00:00:55.900> or<00:00:56.080> often

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
with such a strong that I opted or often

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.439 
with such a strong that I opted or often
you<00:00:56.530> see<00:00:56.799> that<00:00:57.190> color<00:00:57.519> fringing<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:58.089> the<00:00:58.210> sides

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
you see that color fringing on the sides

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.590 
you see that color fringing on the sides
this<00:00:59.320> lens<00:00:59.650> should<00:01:00.250> not<00:01:00.460> have<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.909> happen<00:01:01.210> or

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
this lens should not have that happen or

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.450 
this lens should not have that happen or
it'll<00:01:01.780> be<00:01:01.900> very<00:01:02.170> minimal<00:01:02.440> which<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.040> really

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
it'll be very minimal which is really

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.580 
it'll be very minimal which is really
nice<00:01:03.670> for<00:01:03.699> getting<00:01:04.210> super<00:01:04.629> crisp<00:01:05.049> sharp

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
nice for getting super crisp sharp

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.399 
nice for getting super crisp sharp

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
out there but that's because of the

millimeter<00:02:06.909> ports<00:02:07.210> will<00:02:07.359> work<00:02:07.569> with<00:02:07.749> this<00:02:07.899> but

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
millimeter ports will work with this but

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.680 
millimeter ports will work with this but
not<00:02:08.319> all<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.860> then<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.850> screws<00:02:10.240> directly

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
not all and then this screws directly

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.330 
not all and then this screws directly
into<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:11.890> flip<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
into here so that you can flip it on and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.190 
into here so that you can flip it on and
off<00:02:12.550> your<00:02:12.670> camera<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.870> flip<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
off your camera and you can flip the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.710 
off your camera and you can flip the
math<00:02:14.410> multiplier<00:02:15.069> on<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.580> off<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:15.910> diopter

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
math multiplier on and off your diopter

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.360 
math multiplier on and off your diopter
so<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> pretty<00:02:17.470> neat<00:02:17.740> system<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.280> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
so it's a pretty neat system when you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.800 
so it's a pretty neat system when you
get<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.610> all<00:02:18.730> set<00:02:18.970> up<00:02:19.000> you've<00:02:19.300> got<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> really
