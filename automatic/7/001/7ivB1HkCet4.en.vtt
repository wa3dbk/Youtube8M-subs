 every doctor 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.660
 You also see so far 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.100
 top idea not if not then 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.100
 how could an incentive 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 a year earlier 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.529
 football school falls asleep 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.710
 to lay on the table 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
 be amber alert 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 in the back, injured themselves for the return of the king of pop 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.670
 world music must remain silent 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.830
 was previously assumed 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.170
 Herein the pursuit comes from Haaksbergen 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.080
 I have become very curious about a response to previous questions what about it 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.810
 the hand 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.140
 employees who were hit hardest last year 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.760
 the doorstep selling practices are annoying 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.950
 the county and the roads and traffic agency 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.040
 mohandis ruled the state council shortly thereafter 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.530
 that is less than last year due to being outside the center of athens 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.340
 maxwell 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.140
 the the belgian tennis star 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.580
 the cell must be the transmitter the third hectare the starters as such the plugs though 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.800
 just to drive 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.460
 then you agree with once 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 it was only since a few years that a star class does not show them up 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.240
 it's a bit like a personal wish the number of competitors on the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 it is decided to the world title to be buried here in the meantime 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.300
 then thousands of people become councilors theo berends front line 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.480
 because meal writes in the name 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.250
 good luck 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 more than 60 percent 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.649
 stay with it for that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.649
 a lot of gold spokesperson that comes to municipal employees 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 I still have to do that too 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.210
 go to bed for a short time 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.430
 for distillates being a skirmish we naturally want as 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.990
 you don't place a government spokesperson on their behavior 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 just funny i'm older than 50 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.890
 on the list dedecker in the member council of the kro tuesday that should be 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.770
 approved wow informed a group of british newspaper daily mail about the area 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.740
 he said 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.590
 or just a control tower for a gun freak we are the girl 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.939
 7 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.899
 that the so far 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.349
 top idea not if not then 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.360
 also could be an incentive
