name I'm Alex I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.570 
name I'm Alex I'm gonna be talking about
that<00:00:15.030> guy<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.500> these<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> blab<00:00:17.279> droids

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
that guy so these are the blab droids

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.510 
that guy so these are the blab droids
these<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:17.970> robots<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:19.250> filming<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
these are robots that are filming and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
these are robots that are filming and
directing<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.480> document<00:00:21.960> tree<00:00:22.140> made

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
directing the first document tree made

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.279 
directing the first document tree made
entirely<00:00:22.680> by<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:23.070> who<00:00:23.369> where<00:00:23.519> robots<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> I'm

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
entirely by them who where robots so I'm

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.980 
entirely by them who where robots so I'm
going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> bit<00:00:25.980> over<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.119> line<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to go a bit over where the line of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
going to go a bit over where the line of
reasoning<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:28.890> guys<00:00:29.099> came<00:00:29.429> along<00:00:29.640> so

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
reasoning for these guys came along so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
reasoning for these guys came along so
about<00:00:29.970> three<00:00:30.300> four<00:00:30.480> years<00:00:30.510> ago<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> media

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
about three four years ago at the media

about three four years ago at the media
lab<00:00:31.439> studying<00:00:31.920> human<00:00:32.189> robot<00:00:32.460> symbiosis<00:00:32.960> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
lab studying human robot symbiosis and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.069 
lab studying human robot symbiosis and
that's<00:00:34.530> where<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.980> try<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.910> person<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that's where you try to get a person and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
that's where you try to get a person and
a<00:00:37.110> robot<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> work<00:00:38.190> together<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> useful

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000 
a robot to work together in a useful
fashion<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.230> example<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.680> hard<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> get

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
fashion for example it's hard to get

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
fashion for example it's hard to get
robots<00:00:41.420> upstairs<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.750> need<00:00:42.870> fancy

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
robots upstairs because you need fancy

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
robots upstairs because you need fancy
feet<00:00:43.410> wheels<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> stuff<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> weren't

feet wheels and stuff but if you weren't
asked<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.149> help<00:00:45.920> maybe<00:00:46.920> it'd<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:50.059> helped<00:00:51.059> if

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
asked for help maybe it'd be helped if

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
asked for help maybe it'd be helped if
you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.170> help<00:00:52.379> press<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> green<00:00:53.520> button<00:00:53.640> on

you can help press the green button on

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can help press the green button on
the<00:00:54.239> side<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.750> head<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.360> robot<00:00:57.719> roamed

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the side of my head so this robot roamed

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
the side of my head so this robot roamed
around<00:00:58.140> asking<00:00:58.649> people<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.070> help<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
around asking people for help but the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
around asking people for help but the
but<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> real<00:01:00.390> interesting<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.410> not

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but the real interesting thing was not

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520 
but the real interesting thing was not
that<00:01:01.770> people<00:01:01.890> helped<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:04.409> was

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that people helped it was that it was

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.359 
that people helped it was that it was
built<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.040> cute<00:01:05.460> ah<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.189> done

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
built to be cute ah this was done

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
built to be cute ah this was done
somewhat<00:01:09.000> mathematically<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
somewhat mathematically to have the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.330 
somewhat mathematically to have the
ratios<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> size<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
ratios and size of of this other of this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
ratios and size of of this other of this
other<00:01:14.520> thing<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.020> big<00:01:16.320> head<00:01:16.530> small<00:01:16.740> body

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
other thing you know big head small body

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
other thing you know big head small body
makes<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> baby<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> having

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
makes you think of a baby and having

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
makes you think of a baby and having
sort<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> white<00:01:19.619> eyes<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> obviously<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
sort of white eyes and obviously the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
sort of white eyes and obviously the
voice<00:01:20.670> helps<00:01:21.409> but<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> interesting<00:01:22.740> thing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
voice helps but the interesting thing

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
voice helps but the interesting thing
was<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> people<00:01:23.520> were<00:01:24.049> laying<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.259> with

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
was that people were laying down with

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
was that people were laying down with
the<00:01:25.530> robot<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.009> telling<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> robot<00:01:26.729> their

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the robot and telling the robot their

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.100 
the robot and telling the robot their
problems<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> runner<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
problems this is a runner from the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
problems this is a runner from the
Boston<00:01:28.470> Marathon<00:01:28.560> who<00:01:28.979> I've<00:01:29.130> blacked<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.820> for

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
Boston Marathon who I've blacked out for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.319 
Boston Marathon who I've blacked out for
reasons<00:01:31.460> he<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> floor

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
reasons he was he was on the floor

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
reasons he was he was on the floor
telling<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.840> robot<00:01:34.170> he<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.530> met<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
telling this robot he just met in this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.300 
telling this robot he just met in this
weird<00:01:35.310> lab<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.619> grounded<00:01:37.619> because

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
weird lab that he was grounded because

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
weird lab that he was grounded because
of<00:01:38.460> his<00:01:38.670> flight<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.630> canceled<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
of his flight was was canceled so this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.590 
of his flight was was canceled so this
was<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:41.070> interesting<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:42.420> did<00:01:42.509> this

there's this okay the Elijah effect were
a<00:02:09.640> computer<00:02:10.209> would<00:02:10.330> act<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.600> psychologist

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
a computer would act like a psychologist

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.330 
a computer would act like a psychologist
and<00:02:11.350> they<00:02:11.440> found<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.860> people<00:02:12.040> that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and they found that the people that

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.760 
and they found that the people that
actually<00:02:12.600> program<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.750> thing<00:02:13.930> we're<00:02:14.530> crying

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
actually program the thing we're crying

in front of and had emotional

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.490 
in front of and had emotional
connections<00:02:16.630> with<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.350> kind<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
connections with it we just kind of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.250 
connections with it we just kind of
strange<00:02:17.800> since<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.250> text<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> my

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
strange since it's just text so my

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.650 
strange since it's just text so my
interest<00:02:20.700> moving<00:02:21.700> us<00:02:21.790> forward<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.209> art

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
interest moving us forward is like art

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
interest moving us forward is like art
was<00:02:23.050> using<00:02:23.380> art<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.680> an<00:02:23.830> experiment<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.520> making

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
was using art as an experiment so making

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.580 
was using art as an experiment so making
these<00:02:25.000> things<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.420> seemingly<00:02:26.110> don't<00:02:26.410> have

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
these things that seemingly don't have

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.310 
these things that seemingly don't have
much<00:02:27.010> emotion<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.690> testing<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.290> see

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
much emotion to them and testing to see

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.449 
much emotion to them and testing to see
if<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.739> know<00:02:29.800> people<00:02:30.160> will<00:02:30.250> have<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
if you know people will have a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.410 
if you know people will have a
connection<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> here's<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.850> music<00:02:34.239> box

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
connection to it so here's a music box

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.990

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
and I started winding down and getting

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.860

machine that's dying so may this drum

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.880 
machine that's dying so may this drum
that's<00:03:21.769> counting<00:03:22.130> down<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.519> its<00:03:22.700> own<00:03:22.849> death<00:03:29.890> so

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
that's counting down to its own death so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.199 
that's counting down to its own death so
obviously<00:03:31.190> here<00:03:31.370> people<00:03:31.640> had<00:03:31.730> very<00:03:31.940> strong

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
particular personal take on death and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.069 
particular personal take on death and

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
mortality but obviously all these are

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.750 
mortality but obviously all these are
very<00:03:39.200> simple<00:03:39.620> machines<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.549> see

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
very simple machines but you can see

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.059 
very simple machines but you can see
that<00:03:41.000> they<00:03:41.420> create<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.720> very<00:03:41.930> strong<00:03:42.260> emotional

connection<00:03:50.079> alright<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:51.230> back<00:03:51.349> to<00:03:51.530> robots<00:03:51.860> so

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
connection alright so back to robots so

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.030 
connection alright so back to robots so
