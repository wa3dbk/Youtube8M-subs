00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880
 and 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.480
 greet you my dear subscribers in 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.300
 this video I want to make out with you alone 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.879
 reef 1 means technical drawings 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.739
 which are used in thrash metal music 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.440
 here we will play only one by one 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.989
 the sixth open string is important here 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.970
 remember the rhythm pattern itself here 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.070
 almost no left hand participants 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.659
 most importantly it will work here 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 the right hand is good 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.470
 right arm exercise and so let's 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.039
 fight with you right away we mean 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.149
 what does it make up this rhythm string 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.880
 there will be a muffled this rhythm consists of 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.399
 the three main parts first we first 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.270
 analyze strokes and so we play down 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.270
 up or down this will be the first part 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 such a rhythm 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.820
 then we will go again 4 strokes means 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.050
 1 so remember the first part is you 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.970
 sure whether this is where is bliss 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.110
 further we will play the same if you 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.610
 dare but there will be another accent 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:16.720
 first on the first four hits we 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:16.720
 let's focus 3 times 1 on 1 punch further 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.840
 in the second group means strikes we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.940
 let 's focus on the third egor here too 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.210
 we will play with energy here but accent 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.210
 will be 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.069
 times 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.180
 three and the third blow will accent us 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.180
 At first we were played by roblox further 1 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.920
 last three hits it will be just 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.620
 down down down and so let's get it 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.540
 slowly playing again you listen then 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.849
 first we will go 4 blows down 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.890
 up down down next again 4 blows down 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.580
 up down down and then three hits 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.580
 down up down 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.489
 Samara there turns out due to the fact that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.099
 we always emphasize different blows 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.110
 different counting in the beginning we accentuate 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.040
 in the first four strokes maximize 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.659
 the first kick down below we focus on 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.659
 second 4 blows 3 blows down 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.980
 and in the next 3 hits hmm again 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:37.290
 accentuate the first blow 3 more precisely the first 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:39.210
 strike out of 3 so we repeat once again 1 1 1 2 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.710
 3 4 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.840
 almost times like this 1 2 1 1 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.830
 2 you 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.830
 divorce 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.090
 in this way you will need 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.090
 train glue 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.910
 well, and the second option, you can play not 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.840
 Means not to repeat down as I do 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.610
 messi and the top and a mixture of leaves and you can 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.570
 all the time all the beats alternate down 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.570
 up in turn 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.460
 someone might like it better 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.270
 although I advise you to play that option 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.270
 genetic 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.409
 the second option will be fiends over 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.479
 them down up out bright 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.849
 such is that every hit will get 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:49.999
 first we play down then up all 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:53.030
 time alternating the first option is if 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:56.530
 down if 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.870
 down up like this 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.800
 you will need to first remember exactly 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.800
 on a political figure 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.050
 photos of the best even myself 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.909
 in this way here well then 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.819
 quietly will need to accelerate and 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:35.860
 quietly increase speed but when 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.860
 try not to strain your right hand
