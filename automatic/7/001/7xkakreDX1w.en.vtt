00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.820 
designed wife and I really like it and
there's<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.240> few<00:00:29.450> nice<00:00:29.630> touches<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:30.620> want

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.950 
there's a few nice touches that I want
to<00:00:30.890> talk<00:00:31.070> about<00:00:31.239> first<00:00:32.239> of<00:00:32.450> all<00:00:32.570> if<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.809> look

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
to talk about first of all if you look

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.900 
to talk about first of all if you look
through<00:00:33.170> here<00:00:33.469> I'm<00:00:34.070> going<00:00:34.219> to<00:00:34.340> take<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:34.610> tray

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
through here I'm going to take this tray

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.420 
through here I'm going to take this tray
out<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:36.110> can<00:00:36.320> see<00:00:36.530> all<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.860> way<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.280> back

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
out you can see all the way to the back

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.700 
out you can see all the way to the back
so<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.360> should<00:00:38.750> allow<00:00:39.410> for<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:40.340> very<00:00:40.730> good

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
so this should allow for a very good

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.600 
so this should allow for a very good
ventilation<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.950> system<00:00:43.310> it's<00:00:43.490> pretty

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
ventilation of the system it's pretty

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.700 
ventilation of the system it's pretty
much<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.850> wide-open<00:00:44.329> box<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.320> see<00:00:45.470> through

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
much a wide-open box you can see through

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.970 
much a wide-open box you can see through
on<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.070> sides<00:00:46.340> as<00:00:47.090> well<00:00:47.560> it's<00:00:48.560> just<00:00:48.860> a

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
on the sides as well it's just a

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.270 
on the sides as well it's just a
perforated<00:00:49.640> side<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:51.829> have<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:52.160> on

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
perforated side and you have that on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.540 
perforated side and you have that on
both<00:00:52.460> sides<00:00:52.989> here<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.739> also<00:00:55.489> if

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
both sides here and there and also if

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.319 
both sides here and there and also if
you<00:00:55.640> look<00:00:55.760> at<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.940> bottom<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:58.329> pretty

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
you look at the bottom this is pretty

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.569 
you look at the bottom this is pretty
much<00:00:59.450> ventilation<00:00:59.690> for<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.800> main<00:01:01.399> logic

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
much ventilation for the main logic

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.940 
much ventilation for the main logic
board<00:01:01.940> I<00:01:02.090> believe<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:03.530> be<00:01:03.710> again

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
board I believe and this would be again

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.370 
board I believe and this would be again

in you have this rubber points here that
will<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.849> squeezed<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:15.040> hold

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
will just get squeezed in and hold

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.290 
will just get squeezed in and hold

a<00:02:17.360> few<00:02:18.020> other<00:02:18.170> things<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.560> I've<00:02:18.650> noticed

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
a few other things that I've noticed

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700 
a few other things that I've noticed
first<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:20.480> plug<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.140> it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
first of all if you just plug this in it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.590 
first of all if you just plug this in it
won't<00:02:21.980> work<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.340> dsm<00:02:22.790> operating<00:02:23.180> system<00:02:23.450> is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
won't work the dsm operating system is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.410 
won't work the dsm operating system is
not<00:02:23.960> installed<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.250> once<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.880> plug<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.240> in

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
not installed so once you plug it in

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.050 
not installed so once you plug it in
your<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.730> use<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.780> provided

software<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.390> disk<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.350> I'm<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.590> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
software on the disk so I'm going to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.590 
software on the disk so I'm going to
plug<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:33.890> put<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:34.970> my<00:02:35.060> computer<00:02:35.330> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
plug that put that in my computer and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.820 
plug that put that in my computer and
show<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.020> how<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.380> goes

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
so I have the power connected in the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.630 
so I have the power connected in the
back<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.520> gigabit<00:02:41.480> port<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.170> here<00:02:42.410> we<00:02:42.470> go

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
back and a gigabit port and here we go

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.040 
back and a gigabit port and here we go
just<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.760> light<00:02:43.910> touch<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.420> power<00:02:44.630> button

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
just a light touch of the power button

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.220 
just a light touch of the power button
and<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.730> booting<00:02:47.270> sequence<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.140> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
and the booting sequence is going to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.800 
and the booting sequence is going to
start<00:02:48.470> once<00:02:49.370> once<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.880> fire<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.390> disk<00:02:50.630> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
start once once you fire up to disk you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.290 
start once once you fire up to disk you
get<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.440> start<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.550> will<00:02:52.700> install<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
get to this start it will install the

believe me I tried second of all if you
put<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> hard<00:03:50.330> drive<00:03:50.600> make<00:03:51.350> sure<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.070> one

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
put a hard drive make sure that it's one

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.670 
put a hard drive make sure that it's one
of<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.610> recommended<00:03:53.360> ones<00:03:53.570> or<00:03:53.810> at<00:03:54.260> least<00:03:54.470> some

a hard drive that somebody else used

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.930 
a hard drive that somebody else used
before<00:03:56.660> because<00:03:57.290> otherwise<00:03:57.680> again<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.459> not

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
before because otherwise again is not
