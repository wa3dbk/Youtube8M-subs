00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:08.814
 Watch out, Captain. 

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.000
 You know the penguins of Madagascar. 

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:14.194
 But what you do not know is that they have a double life ... 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.840
 Like secret agents. 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.420
 The untold story begins with four brothers 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 Are you my family? 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.534
 You do not have a family, and we'll all die. 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.740
 What the? 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.495
 What's with you Kowalski? 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.220
 They grew up to become masters of disguise. 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.960
 Espionage... 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.839
 ... and the same airline. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 Let's get boys to get hot. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Nobody likes a great soldier! 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 Now, when they have to stop a madman. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.560
 I have the power to destroy you. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.940
 They will have a little competition. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.480
 What the hell's going on here? 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 Stay calm, the penguins, now you are under the protection of the Nordic Stream. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.840
 We do not know who you are. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.380
 Nordic current is an undercover elite ... 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.460
 Nordic electricity is an elite under the a ... 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 ... a working group that is trained to ... 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 ... dedicated to helping ... each other. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520
 IN NOVEMBER. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 We have to stop a madman. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300
 I give the orders here. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.740
 He had to get his handcuffs. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.160
 He had no wings only. But I also have wings. 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.280
 So it's useless. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 WHEN THE WORLD NEED HELP. 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.240
 After them! 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.260
 Come on, boys, it's like Cuba. 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.500
 Venice, Rio de Janeiro. 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 Dusseldorf .. 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.700
 We have arrived in the center of Dublin, Ireland. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 We have to get involved ... the guides dance. 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.034
 HEROES. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.180
 We do not need them. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.320
 DEVIN LEGENDE. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.780
 Penguins are our feathers and our flesh, and if someone wants to save us ... 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.900
 ... we are the ones. 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.800
 FROM THE MADAGASCAR CREATORS. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.300
 He hacked our system. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.040
 Debby. 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.612
 Dave. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.120
 ... Dave 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.732
 Where is the sound? 

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.954
 Dave, your microphone is not on. 

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.155
 Press the button with a microphone image. 

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:06.514
 Every time a villain sounds, that's what's happening. 

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:07.554
 Hello. 

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:10.476
 Now we will not see you again, but we'll hear you ... 

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.412
 ... I'm talking to my parents. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 PINGUINS FROM MADAGASCAR 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.420
 We have to find Dave's hiding place. 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.420
 Okay, where's Dave? You know everything you know. 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.080
 Sir, that's an octopus. 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720
 I'm sorry, my friend. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720
 NOVEMBER 26
