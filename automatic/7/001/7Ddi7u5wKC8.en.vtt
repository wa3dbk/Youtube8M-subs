your mobile phone okay so can we create

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.410 
your mobile phone okay so can we create
an<00:00:55.379> action<00:00:55.500> sure<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.280> fourth<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.059> basically

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
an action sure our fourth so basically

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
an action sure our fourth so basically
this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> Texas<00:00:58.109> Instruments<00:00:58.620> prototype<00:00:59.100> at

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this is a Texas Instruments prototype at

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.979 
this is a Texas Instruments prototype at
the<00:00:59.399> moment<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.300> only<00:01:00.420> provides<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the moment so we only provides a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
the moment so we only provides a
technology<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> likelihood<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.789> sell

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
technology so the likelihood is you sell

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.240 
technology so the likelihood is you sell
that<00:01:03.180> ship<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.660> someone<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.589> Sony<00:01:04.830> Ericsson

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that ship to someone like Sony Ericsson

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
that ship to someone like Sony Ericsson
or<00:01:05.339> Samsung<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.780> put<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.049> their<00:01:07.290> devices

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
or Samsung to to put into their devices

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
or Samsung to to put into their devices
for<00:01:08.100> exactly<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:09.000> manufacturers<00:01:09.600> will

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
for exactly two manufacturers will

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
for exactly two manufacturers will
decide<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.799> take<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.549> chip<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.270> go<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
decide not to take this chip to go to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
decide not to take this chip to go to
the<00:01:12.689> motor<00:01:12.869> market<00:01:13.380> place<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> idea<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the motor market place so the idea is to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
the motor market place so the idea is to
you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> increase<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> size<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you know to increase the size of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640 
you know to increase the size of the
mobile<00:01:16.710> phone<00:01:17.360> which<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.570> small<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.530> know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
mobile phone which are small you know

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.600 
mobile phone which are small you know
today<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> look<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.460> that's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
today we have a look at that that's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
today we have a look at that that's
great<00:01:20.850> exactly<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:21.780> basically<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
great exactly you know basically the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
great exactly you know basically the
idea<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.520> full<00:01:24.119> format<00:01:24.509> picture

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
idea is to have a a full format picture

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
idea is to have a a full format picture
okay<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> instead<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.400> having<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
okay so you know instead of having a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
okay so you know instead of having a
small<00:01:27.540> LCD<00:01:27.780> screen<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> picture<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
small LCD screen to have a picture that

okay<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.340> we<00:01:51.729> will<00:01:51.760> have<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.000> interpolation

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
okay so we will have this interpolation

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.450 
okay so we will have this interpolation
by<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.840> end<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.140> year<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.530> manufacturers

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.980 
will take this cheap and bring it to
market<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.190> think<00:01:57.280> probably<00:01:57.580> 2009<00:01:58.360> 2010

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990

market so you think probably 2009 2010
maybe<00:01:59.290> four<00:01:59.619> if<00:02:00.159> someone<00:02:00.460> took<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.790> chip

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
maybe four if someone took the chip

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.060

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.650 
now this is probably gonna end really
badly<00:03:23.829> there's<00:03:24.730> basically<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.120> scale<00:03:25.450> between

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
badly there's basically a scale between
