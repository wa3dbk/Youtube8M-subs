00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.640
 the smell of lavender and here I planted 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.769
 winning is not because it is here 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.019
 clogged in the morning sun that my 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:28.489
 half of the day the sun is of course very strong 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:31.159
 and therefore these plants get 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.799
 sunlight first clan of the day when 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.750
 the sun is not very strong and so on 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.269

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.549
 maximum yield of its aromatic 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.989
