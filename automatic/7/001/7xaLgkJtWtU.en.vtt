00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
is pretty decent looking and if you're

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.980 
is pretty decent looking and if you're
lucky<00:05:38.310> enough<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.699> have<00:05:38.759> a<00:05:38.880> decent<00:05:39.030> i<00:05:39.690> SPECT

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
lucky enough to have a decent i SPECT

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.560 
lucky enough to have a decent i SPECT
computer<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:41.130> then<00:05:41.400> this<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:41.699> a<00:05:41.729> really<00:05:42.419> good

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
computer and then this is a really good

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.890 
computer and then this is a really good
graphical<00:05:42.960> game<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.320> play<00:05:43.440> that's<00:05:44.159> if

graphical game to play that's if

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.210 
graphical game to play that's if
graphics<00:05:45.199> your<00:05:45.410> cell<00:05:45.560> i<00:05:45.590> think<00:05:45.860> he's<00:05:45.979> got<00:05:46.100> all

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
graphics your cell i think he's got all

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.400 
graphics your cell i think he's got all
about<00:05:46.430> graphics<00:05:46.820> but<00:05:46.940> there<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.360> go<00:05:47.419> see<00:05:48.350> you

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
about graphics but there you go see you

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.530 
about graphics but there you go see you
know
