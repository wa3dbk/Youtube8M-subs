one<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> easiest<00:00:47.850> ways<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.539> tell<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
one of the easiest ways you can tell is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.200 
one of the easiest ways you can tell is
grab<00:00:49.590> hold<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.100> block<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
grab hold of your block and if your

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
grab hold of your block and if your
handle<00:00:52.010> will<00:00:53.010> start<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> roll<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:55.489> where

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
handle will start to roll on you where

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
handle will start to roll on you where
the<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> handle<00:00:57.899> comes<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the where the handle comes out of the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.959 
the where the handle comes out of the
block<00:00:58.829> there's<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.399> call<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> riser

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
block there's what they call the riser

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.170 
block there's what they call the riser
there<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> starts<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> break<00:01:01.559> down

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
there and when that starts to break down

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.670 
there and when that starts to break down
you'll<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> point<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.470> your

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you'll get to the point where your

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
you'll get to the point where your
handle<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.909> isn't<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.630> call

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
handle this one isn't what I would call

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
handle this one isn't what I would call
really<00:01:07.110> bad<00:01:07.409> yet<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.820> keep

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really bad yet but I like to really keep

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
really bad yet but I like to really keep
one<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> my<00:01:09.630> ropes<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> good

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
one of my ropes and be right in a good

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
one of my ropes and be right in a good
one<00:01:11.700> people<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.150> solid<00:01:12.570> handle<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.020> there

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
one people get solid handle on there

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.710 
one people get solid handle on there
because<00:01:13.500> how<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> rope<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.220> designed<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because how the rope is designed so that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
because how the rope is designed so that
when<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.170> hand<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the wrap and it's up against the block

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.240 
the wrap and it's up against the block
if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.729> come<00:01:20.939> off<00:01:21.119> away<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.900> hand<00:01:22.250> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that if the handle and the riser and the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
that if the handle and the riser and the
block<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> everything<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> solid<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> works

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
block and everything is solid it works

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
block and everything is solid it works
to<00:01:27.930> break<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> bind<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.189> hand<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:30.030> you

to break the bind on your hand get you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
to break the bind on your hand get you
out<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> bull<00:01:30.900> rope<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.850> good

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
out of the bull rope you know a good

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
out of the bull rope you know a good
percent<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> time<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> say<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
percent of the time it's not to say that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
percent of the time it's not to say that
you<00:01:34.950> can't<00:01:35.250> still<00:01:35.579> hang<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you can't still hang up but it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
you can't still hang up but it
definitely<00:01:37.409> does<00:01:37.950> help<00:01:38.189> avoid<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> by

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
definitely does help avoid that by

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.830 
definitely does help avoid that by
keeping<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.290> keeping<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.070> rope<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.520> check

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
keeping up keeping a good rope in check

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.450 
keeping up keeping a good rope in check
also<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.259> thing<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
also one other thing you want to be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.310 
also one other thing you want to be
watching<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.750> call<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> wear

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
watching is what they call the wear

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.719 
watching is what they call the wear
strip<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:49.369> where<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.640> actual<00:01:51.360> tail<00:01:52.729> starts

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
strip it's where your actual tail starts

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.830 
strip it's where your actual tail starts
and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> goes<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> way<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and then it goes back all the way up to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.380 
and then it goes back all the way up to
where<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.500> handle<00:01:59.430> comes<00:01:59.640> back<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
where your handle comes back in and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
where your handle comes back in and
that's<00:02:00.540> where<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.869> rope<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.259> always<00:02:01.560> usually

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's where your rope is always usually

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.819 
that's where your rope is always usually
getting<00:02:02.430> pulled<00:02:02.790> across<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
getting pulled across you can see it's

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.370 
getting pulled across you can see it's
starting<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.340> frayed<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.700> quite<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> bit

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
starting to get frayed out quite a bit

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
starting to get frayed out quite a bit
and<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:08.640> don't<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:08.970> say<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.720> rope

and you don't like to say this this rope

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
and you don't like to say this this rope
definitely<00:02:10.530> isn't<00:02:11.480> as<00:02:12.480> bad<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.050> some<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> them

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
definitely isn't as bad as some of them

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
definitely isn't as bad as some of them
