been working on the project flow can you
see<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> river<00:00:10.940> I've<00:00:11.940> worked<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.630> water

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
see the river I've worked with the water

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.110 
see the river I've worked with the water
a<00:00:13.080> lot<00:00:13.349> trying<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> make<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> visible<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
a lot trying to make it visible to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.930 
a lot trying to make it visible to
people<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.920> here<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.039> Indianapolis<00:00:17.400> was

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
people and here in Indianapolis was

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.779 
people and here in Indianapolis was
really<00:00:18.210> invisible<00:00:19.490> since<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.609> wasn't

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
really invisible since it wasn't

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.029 
really invisible since it wasn't
navigable<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.990> had<00:00:22.140> never<00:00:22.320> been<00:00:22.439> built<00:00:22.830> up

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
navigable it had never been built up

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.060 
navigable it had never been built up
like<00:00:23.640> Chicago<00:00:24.630> Milwaukee<00:00:25.640> Cleveland<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:28.070> kept

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like Chicago Milwaukee Cleveland I kept

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.759 
like Chicago Milwaukee Cleveland I kept
investigating<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.109> realized<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> seventy

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
investigating and realized that seventy

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
investigating and realized that seventy
percent<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> drinking<00:00:32.790> water<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.329> coming

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
percent of the drinking water was coming

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.290 
percent of the drinking water was coming
from<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.899> river<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.340> fact<00:00:35.370> very

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
from that river which was in fact very

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.950 
from that river which was in fact very
polluted<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.280> was<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.550> thinking<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
polluted I was really thinking about the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040 
polluted I was really thinking about the
river<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> mirror<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> city<00:00:42.020> how<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
river as a mirror of the city how I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.940 
river as a mirror of the city how I
could<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:44.160> mirrors<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.809> express<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.079> how

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
could use mirrors to express that how

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
could use mirrors to express that how
you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.370> engage<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:49.020> situation

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you can engage people with a situation

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.209 
you can engage people with a situation
with<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> place<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.840> appreciate<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
with a place and make them appreciate it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.480 
with a place and make them appreciate it
and<00:00:53.460> care<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
and care for it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.220 
and care for it
when<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.240> look<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.570> mirror<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:57.020> see

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
when you look in the mirror you see

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.530 
when you look in the mirror you see
yourself<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.830> relation<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:58.670> landscape

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
yourself in relation to that landscape

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.350 
yourself in relation to that landscape
behind<00:00:59.720> you<00:01:00.200> there's<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.360> physical

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
behind you there's that physical

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.260 
behind you there's that physical
visceral<00:01:02.990> engagement<00:01:03.620> immediately<00:01:04.280> that

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
visceral engagement immediately that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.880 
visceral engagement immediately that
then<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.810> hope<00:01:06.020> will<00:01:06.170> slow<00:01:06.500> people<00:01:06.860> down

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
then you hope will slow people down

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.870 
then you hope will slow people down
enough<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:08.680> note<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.100> thing<00:01:10.370> that<00:01:10.640> you're

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
enough to note the thing that you're

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.270 
enough to note the thing that you're
pointing<00:01:11.360> out<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:12.170> levee<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.890> you're

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
pointing out the levee that you're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.430 
pointing out the levee that you're
standing<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.880> for<00:01:14.180> instance<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.870> maybe

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
standing on for instance and maybe

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.350 
standing on for instance and maybe
that's<00:01:15.740> all<00:01:15.950> they'll<00:01:16.160> do<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.460> see<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.030> word

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
that's all they'll do is see that word

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.770 
that's all they'll do is see that word
but<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:18.140> they<00:01:18.410> at<00:01:19.370> least<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:20.000> had<00:01:20.180> that<00:01:20.390> part

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
but now they at least have had that part

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.160 
but now they at least have had that part
of<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.050> environment<00:01:21.650> decoded<00:01:22.870> now<00:01:23.870> if

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
of the environment decoded now if

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.720 
of the environment decoded now if
they're<00:01:24.440> more<00:01:24.590> interested<00:01:24.830> they<00:01:25.190> get<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.490> dial

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
they're more interested they get to dial

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.900 
they're more interested they get to dial
up<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.270> hear<00:01:27.020> more<00:01:27.200> about<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.550> can<00:01:28.760> go

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
up and hear more about it so you can go

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.820 
up and hear more about it so you can go
deeper<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.450> deeper<00:01:29.600> into<00:01:29.810> this<00:01:30.140> till<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.650> get

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
deeper and deeper into this till you get

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.880 
deeper and deeper into this till you get
to<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.160> very<00:01:31.520> factual<00:01:32.440> content<00:01:33.440> about<00:01:33.710> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
to the very factual content about it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.450 
to the very factual content about it
it's<00:01:34.729> really<00:01:34.970> interesting<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:36.020> me<00:01:36.170> how

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
it's really interesting to me how

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.700 
it's really interesting to me how
technology<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.670> physical<00:01:38.210> sight<00:01:38.570> can<00:01:38.990> kind

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
technology and physical sight can kind

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.230 
technology and physical sight can kind
of<00:01:39.800> be<00:01:39.979> layered<00:01:40.310> together<00:01:42.130> there<00:01:43.130> are<00:01:43.430> about<00:01:44.210> a

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
of be layered together there are about a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.090 
of be layered together there are about a
hundred<00:01:44.450> points<00:01:44.900> along<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.710> river<00:01:45.920> that

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
