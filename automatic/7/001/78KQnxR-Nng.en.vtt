about<00:02:05.880> making<00:02:06.030> smart<00:02:06.900> moves<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.410> actually<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
about making smart moves so actually the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.220 
about making smart moves so actually the
target<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.360> automatic<00:02:09.780> oh<00:02:09.929> my

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
target with automatic oh my

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.410 
target with automatic oh my
automatically<00:02:10.800> marked<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.640> people<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.240> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
automatically marked the people and you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.420 
automatically marked the people and you
have<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.080> use<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.500> analogical<00:02:14.160> stick

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
have just to use your analogical stick

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.300 
have just to use your analogical stick
like<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.210> cock<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.660> click<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.830> at<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> right

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
like a cock and click on it at the right

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
like a cock and click on it at the right
time<00:02:17.550> shoot<00:02:17.940> all<00:02:18.090> your<00:02:18.240> enemies<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:19.290> certain

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
points of the game you will have to face

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840 
points of the game you will have to face
with<00:02:21.240> jewel<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.250> idea<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.580> really

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
