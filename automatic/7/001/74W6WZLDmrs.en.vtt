hi<00:00:07.240> this<00:00:07.300> is<00:00:07.570> julie<00:00:07.930> with<00:00:08.260> beadaholique.com

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.109 

in<00:00:25.329> riyadh<00:00:26.019> beads<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.679> just<00:00:27.429> has<00:00:27.640> that<00:00:27.849> nice

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
in riyadh beads and just has that nice

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.779 
in riyadh beads and just has that nice
coil<00:00:28.810> shape<00:00:29.229> I'm<00:00:29.859> going<00:00:30.159> to<00:00:30.309> show<00:00:30.399> you<00:00:30.489> three

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
coil shape I'm going to show you three

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.460 
coil shape I'm going to show you three
different<00:00:30.819> ways<00:00:31.239> that<00:00:31.509> you<00:00:31.630> can<00:00:31.839> finish<00:00:32.320> your

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
different ways that you can finish your

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.460 
different ways that you can finish your
ends<00:00:33.130> after<00:00:33.280> you've<00:00:33.520> added<00:00:33.730> all<00:00:33.910> your<00:00:34.120> beads

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
ends after you've added all your beads

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.020 
ends after you've added all your beads
so<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.620> first<00:00:35.830> way<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.340> probably<00:00:36.910> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
so the first way and probably the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.140 
so the first way and probably the
easiest<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.840> just<00:00:38.410> make<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.400> little<00:00:39.520> loop<00:00:39.760> at

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
easiest is to just make a little loop at

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.060 
easiest is to just make a little loop at
the<00:00:40.210> end<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.870> your<00:00:41.080> memory<00:00:41.350> wire<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:41.770> I've<00:00:41.890> got

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
the end of your memory wire so I've got

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.700 
the end of your memory wire so I've got
some<00:00:42.250> wire<00:00:42.400> looping<00:00:42.790> pliers<00:00:42.850> here<00:00:43.510> just<00:00:44.440> going

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
some wire looping pliers here just going

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.120 
some wire looping pliers here just going
to<00:00:44.830> put<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.460> wire<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.530> twist<00:00:47.530> around

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.069 

and<00:00:51.130> there<00:00:51.550> we<00:00:51.670> go<00:00:51.790> we<00:00:52.030> have<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.180> loop<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.600> that

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
and there we go we have a loop and that

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.660 
and there we go we have a loop and that
will<00:00:53.260> secure<00:00:53.410> your<00:00:53.770> beads<00:00:53.980> from<00:00:54.100> falling<00:00:54.550> off

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
will secure your beads from falling off

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.860 
will secure your beads from falling off
and<00:00:54.970> then<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.180> have<00:00:55.329> something<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.780> can

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
and then you have something that you can

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.250 
and then you have something that you can
add<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.110> little<00:00:56.320> dangle<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.920> that's<00:00:57.730> one<00:00:58.000> way

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
add a little dangle to that's one way

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.050 
add a little dangle to that's one way
another<00:00:59.260> way<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.710> with<00:01:00.160> these<00:01:00.370> little<00:01:00.400> crimp

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
another way is with these little crimp

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.499 
another way is with these little crimp
beads<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.810> have<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.020> loop<00:01:02.380> already<00:01:02.800> attached

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:03.509 
beads that have a loop already attached

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:06.499 
beads that have a loop already attached
so<00:01:04.509> I'm<00:01:04.569> going<00:01:04.689> to<00:01:04.719> do<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.019> on<00:01:05.170> another<00:01:05.289> end

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
so I'm going to do that on another end

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.209 
so I'm going to do that on another end
so<00:01:07.509> to<00:01:07.569> work<00:01:07.810> with<00:01:08.020> these<00:01:08.319> what<00:01:08.859> you're<00:01:09.009> going

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219 
so to work with these what you're going

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.770 
so to work with these what you're going
to<00:01:09.310> do<00:01:09.490> is<00:01:10.060> go<00:01:10.299> ahead<00:01:10.569> just<00:01:11.560> pop<00:01:11.829> it<00:01:12.009> on<00:01:12.100> there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to do is go ahead just pop it on there

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.779 
to do is go ahead just pop it on there
take<00:01:13.780> your<00:01:13.990> crimping<00:01:14.380> pliers<00:01:14.679> now<00:01:15.039> we're<00:01:15.670> not

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
take your crimping pliers now we're not

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.129 
take your crimping pliers now we're not
going<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:15.999> want<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.179> crimp<00:01:16.420> up<00:01:16.569> near<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.929> loop

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
going to want to crimp up near the loop

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.989 
going to want to crimp up near the loop
because<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:18.039> run<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.340> risk<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.759> actually

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
because you run the risk of actually

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.239 
because you run the risk of actually
hurting<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.780> loop<00:01:19.929> itself<00:01:20.289> so<00:01:20.950> what<00:01:21.100> you're

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
hurting the loop itself so what you're

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.669 
hurting the loop itself so what you're
going<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.490> want<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.819> do<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.810> crimp<00:01:26.109> down<00:01:26.200> at

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
going to want to do just crimp down at

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.779 
going to want to do just crimp down at
the<00:01:26.889> bottom<00:01:29.219> you're<00:01:30.219> just<00:01:30.369> going<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.549> crimp

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
the bottom you're just going to crimp

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.830 
the bottom you're just going to crimp
like<00:01:30.999> any<00:01:31.179> other<00:01:31.359> crimp<00:01:31.659> bead

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.090 

and<00:01:38.840> there<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:39.320> go<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.650> that's<00:01:39.740> going<00:01:40.010> to

to place and then we're just going to
let<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> dry<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.790> dry<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
let that dry and it's going to dry and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.110 
let that dry and it's going to dry and
be<00:02:17.330> solid<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.100> those<00:02:19.100> are<00:02:19.280> three<00:02:19.640> separate

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
be solid so those are three separate
