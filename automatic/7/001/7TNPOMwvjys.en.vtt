well<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.920> always<00:00:17.070> try<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.520> look<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.670> lines

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
well I always try and look for lines

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.150 
well I always try and look for lines
that<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.630> unique<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.529> no<00:00:19.680> matter<00:00:19.740> what

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that are unique you know no matter what

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
that are unique you know no matter what
I<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:21.000> lines<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.619> dynamic

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I like lines that are you know dynamic

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.890 
I like lines that are you know dynamic
and<00:00:23.369> force<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> really<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and force you to really be on it and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.240 
and force you to really be on it and
ride<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.230> bike<00:00:25.410> between<00:00:25.920> move<00:00:27.949> lines<00:00:28.949> that

ride your bike between move lines that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
ride your bike between move lines that
that<00:00:29.460> link<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.910> multiple<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.560> multiple

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that link up multiple that with multiple

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
that link up multiple that with multiple
hits<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.430> know<00:00:32.520> where<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.510> actually

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
hits you know where you're actually

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
hits you know where you're actually
riding<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.290> between<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> corner

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
riding in between them you got a corner

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
riding in between them you got a corner
and<00:00:35.550> break<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.780> reason<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.230> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and break that's one reason that this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.930 
and break that's one reason that this
particular<00:00:37.620> line<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.460> appeals<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> me

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
particular line really appeals to me

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.450 
particular line really appeals to me
because<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.870> big<00:00:40.770> mountain<00:00:41.219> feel

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
because it has this big mountain feel

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
because it has this big mountain feel
and<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.390> steep<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> middle

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and very steep but right in the middle

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
and very steep but right in the middle
of<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.739> throw<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> super<00:00:44.550> technical<00:00:44.910> on

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of it you throw the super technical on

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
of it you throw the super technical on
off<00:00:45.570> rock<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.629> makes

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
off rock you know that that just makes

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.470 
off rock you know that that just makes
it<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.289> much<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.550> much<00:00:50.610> harder<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.300> much

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it so much so much harder and so much

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.330 
it so much so much harder and so much
different<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.379> anything<00:00:52.649> I've<00:00:52.890> ever<00:00:52.920> done

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
have four fingers holding the handle bar

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.220 
have four fingers holding the handle bar
and<00:01:00.200> I'm<00:01:00.530> really<00:01:00.950> just<00:01:01.130> knuckle<00:01:01.580> breaking

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
and I'm really just knuckle breaking

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.450 
and I'm really just knuckle breaking

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
definitely new and unique brakes you're

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.000 
definitely new and unique brakes you're
going<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.450> get<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.600> lot<00:01:53.630> more<00:01:53.810> power<00:01:54.229> about

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
going to get a lot more power about

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.040 
going to get a lot more power about
fifty<00:01:55.700> percent<00:01:55.729> more<00:01:56.240> power<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:56.900> you'll

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
fifty percent more power but you'll

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.300 
fifty percent more power but you'll
maintain<00:01:57.200> all<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.710> controllability<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:01.190> new

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
maintain all the controllability the new

maintain not only all the original
strength<00:02:06.680> we<00:02:06.950> actually<00:02:07.640> increase<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
strength we actually increase the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.130 
strength we actually increase the
strength<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:11.170> think<00:02:12.170> that's<00:02:12.410> pretty<00:02:12.650> much<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
strength I think that's pretty much it I

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.600 
strength I think that's pretty much it I
think<00:02:15.140> from<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.739> looks<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.250> might<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
think from the looks we might have to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.390 
think from the looks we might have to
add<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> right<00:02:17.239> side<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> little<00:02:17.720> bit<00:02:18.400> just

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
add to the right side a little bit just

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.820 
add to the right side a little bit just
try<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.450> know<00:02:20.480> bring<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.020> out<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> theory

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
try and you know bring it out to theory

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.250 
try and you know bring it out to theory
