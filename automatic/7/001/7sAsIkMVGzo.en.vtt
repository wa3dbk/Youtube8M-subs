00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
style slightly and it was really good to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.050

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
something to a certain time scale and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.700 
something to a certain time scale and
fitting<00:04:36.780> things<00:04:36.990> together<00:04:37.200> fitting

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
fitting things together fitting

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.410 
fitting things together fitting
different<00:04:38.010> vocals<00:04:38.490> different<00:04:38.880> sound<00:04:39.090> effects

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
different vocals different sound effects

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.880 
different vocals different sound effects
together<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:40.200> actually<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.620> lot<00:04:40.830> more

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
together is actually a lot more

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.740 
together is actually a lot more
complicated<00:04:41.340> than<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:41.850> doing<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.330> commentary

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
complicated than just doing a commentary

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.360 
complicated than just doing a commentary
over<00:04:42.990> gameplay<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:43.800> going<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.010> try<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.190> do

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
over gameplay so I'm going to try to do

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.190 
over gameplay so I'm going to try to do
from<00:04:44.520> now<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.730> it's<00:04:45.390> really<00:04:45.630> try<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.900> integrate

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
from now on it's really try to integrate

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.750 
from now on it's really try to integrate
different<00:04:46.620> things<00:04:47.070> different<00:04:47.280> sort<00:04:47.700> of

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
different things different sort of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.700 
different things different sort of
difference<00:04:48.480> ort<00:04:48.570> of<00:04:48.660> modes<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:49.140> commentary<00:04:49.620> if

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
difference ort of modes of commentary if

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.020 
difference ort of modes of commentary if
that<00:04:49.860> makes<00:04:50.070> sense<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.430> another<00:04:50.700> thing<00:04:50.880> that

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that makes sense and another thing that

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.060 
that makes sense and another thing that
we<00:04:51.090> did<00:04:51.270> is<00:04:51.510> we<00:04:51.810> try<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.320> do<00:04:52.500> an<00:04:52.620> introduction
