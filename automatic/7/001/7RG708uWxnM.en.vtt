00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that we had had slides on it there were

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.130 
that we had had slides on it there were
about<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> foot<00:04:00.420> tall<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:01.939> it<00:04:02.939> was<00:04:03.269> too<00:04:03.750> narrow

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
about a foot tall and it was too narrow

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.970 
about a foot tall and it was too narrow
for<00:04:04.560> us<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.310> clear<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:07.140> bumper<00:04:07.650> here

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
for us to clear this this bumper here

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.809 
for us to clear this this bumper here
and<00:04:08.239> probably<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.569> back<00:04:09.980> little<00:04:10.980> lip<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
and probably that back little lip on the

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.300 
and probably that back little lip on the
fender<00:04:12.150> there<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.450> was<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.650> too<00:04:13.830> narrow<00:04:14.040> that

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
fender there it was just too narrow that

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.780 
fender there it was just too narrow that
too

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
too

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.670 
too
would<00:04:15.329> hit<00:04:15.540> here<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:15.959> drove<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.350> right<00:04:16.380> up

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
would hit here if we drove it right up

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.599 
would hit here if we drove it right up
so<00:04:17.509> when<00:04:18.509> we<00:04:18.600> went<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> Home<00:04:19.139> Depot<00:04:19.609> got

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
so when we went to the Home Depot got

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.290 
so when we went to the Home Depot got
ourselves<00:04:20.959> two<00:04:21.959> 16-foot<00:04:22.440> two<00:04:23.190> by<00:04:23.370> tens<00:04:23.970> and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
ourselves two 16-foot two by tens and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.140 
ourselves two 16-foot two by tens and
then<00:04:25.169> four<00:04:25.830> by<00:04:26.009> four<00:04:26.220> post<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.789> we<00:04:26.850> cut<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
then four by four post and we cut the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.370 
then four by four post and we cut the
post<00:04:27.360> up<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.850> laid<00:04:29.850> about<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.419> know<00:04:30.509> ten<00:04:31.169> inch

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
post up and laid about you know ten inch

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.060 
post up and laid about you know ten inch
wide<00:04:31.820> swath<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:33.000> post<00:04:33.210> every<00:04:33.630> few<00:04:33.870> feet<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
wide swath a post every few feet and

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.719 
wide swath a post every few feet and
then<00:04:35.250> laid<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.729> two<00:04:36.479> by<00:04:36.690> ten<00:04:37.009> on<00:04:38.009> top<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.580> it

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
then laid the two by ten on top of it

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.350 
then laid the two by ten on top of it
nailed<00:04:39.509> her<00:04:39.660> down<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:41.240> built<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.270> little

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
nailed her down and then built a little

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
nailed her down and then built a little
platform<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:43.050> guess<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:44.400> could

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
platform I guess so that we could

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.689 
platform I guess so that we could
actually<00:04:45.060> clear<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.250> rails<00:04:47.430> would

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
actually clear this so the rails would

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.029 
actually clear this so the rails would
sit<00:04:47.940> underneath<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.539> so<00:04:49.349> we<00:04:49.470> can<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.949> on

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
sit underneath it so we can get it on

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.610 
sit underneath it so we can get it on
the<00:04:50.220> damn<00:04:50.370> trailer<00:04:50.699> and<00:04:51.150> as<00:04:52.080> soon<00:04:52.259> as<00:04:52.380> we<00:04:52.500> got

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
the damn trailer and as soon as we got

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.700 
the damn trailer and as soon as we got
back<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:53.160> my<00:04:53.699> brother's<00:04:54.030> house<00:04:54.210> with<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.710> with

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
back to my brother's house with the with

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.040 
back to my brother's house with the with
the<00:04:55.949> lumber<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.729> build<00:04:56.759> it<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.419> just<00:04:57.690> started

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the lumber to build it it just started

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.379 
the lumber to build it it just started
downpouring<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:59.669> we<00:04:59.789> were<00:04:59.880> out<00:05:00.000> there<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
downpouring so we were out there in the

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.050 
downpouring so we were out there in the
rain<00:05:00.570> building<00:05:01.190> building<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.280> platform<00:05:02.580> on

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
rain building building this platform on

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.350 
rain building building this platform on
top<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.479> trailer<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.610> then<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.729> course<00:05:05.940> you

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
top of a trailer and then of course you

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.290 
top of a trailer and then of course you
know<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.599> thing<00:05:06.780> ran<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.759> as<00:05:08.759> soon<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.060> we<00:05:09.180> got

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
know the thing ran and as soon as we got

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.670 
know the thing ran and as soon as we got
it<00:05:09.449> up<00:05:09.570> we<00:05:09.720> got<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.900> platform<00:05:10.110> built<00:05:10.530> and

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
it up we got the platform built and

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.860 
it up we got the platform built and
tried<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:10.949> drive<00:05:11.160> it<00:05:11.340> up<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.880> died<00:05:12.120> ran<00:05:12.660> out<00:05:12.840> of

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
tried to drive it up it died ran out of

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.890 
tried to drive it up it died ran out of
gas<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.349> think<00:05:13.650> I'm<00:05:13.919> hoping<00:05:14.340> but<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.599> wouldn't

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
gas I think I'm hoping but it wouldn't

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.480 
gas I think I'm hoping but it wouldn't
move<00:05:15.960> any<00:05:16.169> more<00:05:16.349> so<00:05:16.590> we<00:05:16.680> had<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.860> whip<00:05:16.979> out<00:05:17.190> the

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
move any more so we had to whip out the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.330 
move any more so we had to whip out the
the<00:05:18.180> winch<00:05:18.389> we<00:05:18.599> had<00:05:18.810> pull<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.889> up<00:05:20.010> on<00:05:20.190> the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
the winch we had pull it up on the

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.640 
the winch we had pull it up on the
trailer<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.909> as<00:05:21.750> we<00:05:21.990> were<00:05:22.139> doing<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.500> we

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
trailer and as we were doing that we

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.000 
trailer and as we were doing that we
didn't<00:05:22.889> have<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.539> quite<00:05:24.539> centered<00:05:25.020> enough<00:05:25.349> it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
didn't have it quite centered enough it

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.270 
didn't have it quite centered enough it
wasn't<00:05:26.159> perfect<00:05:26.789> so<00:05:26.849> we<00:05:27.030> did<00:05:27.740> did<00:05:28.740> do<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:28.919> little

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
wasn't perfect so we did did do a little

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.379 
wasn't perfect so we did did do a little
damage<00:05:29.639> there<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.449> small<00:05:30.780> little<00:05:31.710> scrape

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
damage there just a small little scrape

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.779 
damage there just a small little scrape
where<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.510> edge<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.930> trailer<00:05:34.320> sides<00:05:35.250> kind

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
where the edge of the trailer sides kind

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.540 
where the edge of the trailer sides kind
of<00:05:35.880> hit<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.150> but<00:05:36.770> caught<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.919> on<00:05:38.039> there<00:05:38.370> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
of hit it but caught it on there and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.189 
of hit it but caught it on there and
then<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.970> course<00:05:39.000> one<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.479> two<00:05:39.599> by<00:05:39.780> six<00:05:40.080> is

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
then of course one the two by six is

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.580 
then of course one the two by six is
broke<00:05:41.240> which<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.419> fine<00:05:42.630> it's<00:05:42.870> still<00:05:43.080> Road<00:05:43.380> all
