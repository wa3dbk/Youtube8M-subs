00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.070
 Hello 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.750
 today I would like to show you how to proceed 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.150
 our shawl and its part 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.570
 we have arrived at this 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.220
 point where we created the first one 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.730
 piece of tunnels with the two laps has 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.980
 thrown interrupted by a round to straight and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 these five knitted needles again 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 shaved 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.739
 we started from what was the 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.800
 base of our network is the name of the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.660
 shawl from these six initial jerseys 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.880
 positioning the four brand points 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 we have created those that are ours 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.950
 lines of increase for the central one in the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.640
 two brand central points and for those 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.310
 lateral 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.680
 the other two lines because our sad 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.640
 and grows in this direction therefore from 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.829
 center and then its sides and into the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 its central part 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.270
 we have made and worked on 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.590
 our shade up to this point now 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.149
 we must make these three irons these 3 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.240
 let's call them alternate cast irons 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.729
 from two needles to ros a backhand to straight 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 to create this little costinha that 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.270
 see delegate and then later 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.760
 what is our part of here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.909
 stockinette stitch and we create as if it were a 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.420
 module articulated on 18 February and then 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.400
 when we are here what we do 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 we resume and work two media straight 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.510
 with our thrown on the first part 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.880
 we always remember to do the two 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.040
 jerseys together with straight with the thrown and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 on the other side the pass passes to the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.460
 right with the thrown this we repeat it 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.770
 then three times alternated by an iron a 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.070
 straight on the wrong side to create that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.220
 that was our costinha here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.439
 repetition now I'll show you 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.180
 the beginning of work here with the two 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.100
 jerseys together with straight to the thrown and 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 what then will be the step 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.380
 pass said from the other side for 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.939
 remember so we always start with the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.269
 2 straight knit we make ours 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.640
 thrown and when we work here we work 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.580
 immediately the two shirts together with straight 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.440
 so I take her from here to work and 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.709
 work 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.970
 2 sweaters together with a straight thrown 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.150
 coming up to what was the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.680
 our brand point when you work 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.569
 two central links in the part 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.520
 next you'll have to remember to do 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.140
 past the pass passes straight on that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.630
 mirrored shirt compared to the 2 meshes 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.090
 together with straight then I will show you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.450
 again how do you take a shirt? 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.160
 the other and then the work you see they have 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.930
 two different directions the two meshes 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.690
 together with straight they go into this 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.519
 direction while the pass goes straight 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.890
 goes in the other direction 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.019
 and this allows us to create two sides 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.239
 perfectly mirrored shawl 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.239
 with the direction of the meshes that if you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.890
 fold it in half fit together 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.209
 when we have realized then 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.489
 these are three irons thrown away 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.299
 and the two plants have the right of return 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.430
 and our stockinette stitch on 5 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.650
 stern always reminding us to do the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.390
 increases nearby brand points 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 we have created a form and the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.370
 repetition of this form that the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.070
 consisting of 18 irons then creates the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.709
 size of our shawl you see 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.140
 I have repeated it here four times and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.600
 then when I arrived at the last one 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.510
 repetition that was my fifth mi 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.820
 I stopped on what was the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 repetition of the last iron 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.109
 so thrown in the next phase 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.870
 we will see how to close our chef e 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.820
 how to be able to then treat it to bring it to 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.590
 what its final size 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.840
 meanwhile we continue to work on 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.840
 our perforated part and good work
