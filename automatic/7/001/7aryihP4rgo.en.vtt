the first thing is it's one of the main

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.240 
the first thing is it's one of the main
what<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:30.599> how<00:03:30.810> they<00:03:31.019> devise<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.769> strap<00:03:34.250> as

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250

you can see it you have to work to take
it<00:03:38.400> off<00:03:38.550> like<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.989> kind<00:03:40.290> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530

dropped<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.620> on<00:04:30.740> concrete<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.630> hasn't

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190

broken my guitar and the worst thing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.450 
broken my guitar and the worst thing
that<00:04:35.900> happened<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> string<00:04:36.830> popped<00:04:37.130> once

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
that happened is the string popped once

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.360 
that happened is the string popped once
it's<00:04:38.450> been<00:04:38.660> totally<00:04:38.870> worth<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.500> money<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.340> I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it's been totally worth the money so I

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.840 
it's been totally worth the money so I
would<00:04:40.580> definitely<00:04:40.910> recommend<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.510> case
