before it turned into a penitentiary and
so<00:04:32.170> we<00:04:32.260> had<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:32.470> kind<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.650> backstory<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
so we had this kind of backstory the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.860 
so we had this kind of backstory the
idea<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.730> warden<00:04:34.300> would<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.690> collected

Civil War weapon one of them is the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.640 
Civil War weapon one of them is the
blundergat<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.290> fictional

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
blundergat and so it's a fictional

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.410 
blundergat and so it's a fictional
weapon<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.160> idea<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.670> combination

weapon but the idea of the combination

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.090 
weapon but the idea of the combination
