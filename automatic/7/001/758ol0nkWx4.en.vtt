make<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.630> much<00:01:46.750> more<00:01:46.930> sense<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
make so much more sense to you so I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.340 
make so much more sense to you so I
promise<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.540> will<00:01:49.660> get<00:01:49.780> easier<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.230> you<00:01:50.320> just

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
promise that will get easier if you just

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.770 
promise that will get easier if you just
try<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:50.770> remember<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.850> that's<00:01:52.390> why<00:01:52.540> in<00:01:52.660> this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
try and remember and that's why in this

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.570 
try and remember and that's why in this
video<00:01:53.080> you're<00:01:53.290> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.860> my<00:01:54.040> method<00:01:54.430> and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
video you're going to see my method and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:09.889 
video you're going to see my method and
then<00:01:54.700> I'm<00:01:54.820> going<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.120> show<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.330> my<00:01:55.540> husband

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080 

and<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.110> that's<00:02:11.350> why<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:12.280> technique<00:02:13.060> that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and so that's why this technique that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
and so that's why this technique that
I'm<00:02:13.300> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.540> show<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.800> good

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I'm going to show you was really good

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.780 
I'm going to show you was really good
for<00:02:15.190> me<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:17.380> your<00:02:17.980> dog<00:02:18.130> can't<00:02:18.430> stand

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
for me because if your dog can't stand

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.990 
for me because if your dog can't stand
you<00:02:19.210> can<00:02:19.360> put<00:02:19.540> one<00:02:20.380> arm<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.890> under<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.580> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
you can put one arm up under here and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.420 
you can put one arm up under here and
then<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.720> sort<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.050> braces<00:02:24.010> them<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.370> you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
then this sort of braces them and you

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.270 
then this sort of braces them and you
can<00:02:24.550> support<00:02:24.760> their<00:02:25.120> weight<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.100> what<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
can support their weight so then what I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
can support their weight so then what I
do<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:28.390> put<00:02:28.600> my<00:02:28.750> my<00:02:29.170> left<00:02:29.380> hand<00:02:29.650> up<00:02:30.460> here

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.570 

like<00:02:34.140> right<00:02:34.440> behind<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.980> ribcage<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.900> then

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
like right behind the ribcage and then

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.650 
like right behind the ribcage and then
once<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.760> what<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.090> water<00:02:39.390> balloon

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
once you know what that water balloon

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.339 
once you know what that water balloon
feels<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.190> sort<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:42.349> squeezing

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
feels like you just sort of squeezing

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.949 
feels like you just sort of squeezing
around<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.800> feel<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.220> water<00:02:44.370> balloon<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.150> then

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
around I feel the water balloon and then

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.300 
around I feel the water balloon and then
you<00:02:46.140> might<00:02:46.290> want<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.770> might<00:02:46.950> wonder<00:02:47.190> how

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you might want it you might wonder how

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.750 
you might want it you might wonder how
much<00:02:47.760> pressure<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.510> should<00:02:48.540> exert<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.760> make

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
much pressure you should exert and make

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.370 
much pressure you should exert and make
sure<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.450> self<00:02:51.660> holding<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> water<00:02:52.140> balloon

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
sure your self holding a water balloon

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.009 
sure your self holding a water balloon
with<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> hole<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:54.599> want<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> water

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
with a hole in it and you want the water

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.210 
with a hole in it and you want the water
to<00:02:55.140> come<00:02:55.380> out<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> water<00:02:55.800> balloon<00:02:56.099> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
to come out of the water balloon and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.130 
to come out of the water balloon and
that's<00:02:56.340> about<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.819> amount<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.120> pressure<00:02:57.360> so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that's about the amount of pressure so

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.380 
that's about the amount of pressure so
firm<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.370> too<00:02:59.580> hard<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.940> you're<00:03:00.090> doing<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
firm but not too hard if you're doing it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.690 
firm but not too hard if you're doing it
too<00:03:00.569> hard<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:01.310> if<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.400> find<00:03:02.610> yourself

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
too hard or if you find yourself

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.430 
too hard or if you find yourself
exerting<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.390> lot<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.630> pressure<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.080> probably

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
exerting a lot of pressure you probably

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.400 
exerting a lot of pressure you probably
don't<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.310> good<00:03:05.519> hold<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.150> bladder

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
don't have a good hold of the bladder

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.960 
don't have a good hold of the bladder
and<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> also<00:03:07.680> helps<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.130> do<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.519> when<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
and it also helps to do this when the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.550 
and it also helps to do this when the
bladder<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.330> full<00:03:09.360> you're<00:03:09.989> more<00:03:10.200> likely<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
bladder is full you're more likely to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.330 
bladder is full you're more likely to
feel<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.920> water<00:03:11.130> blue<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.290> feel<00:03:13.950> like<00:03:13.980> right

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
feel the water blue so I feel like right

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.720 
feel the water blue so I feel like right
here<00:03:14.690> I'm<00:03:15.690> gonna<00:03:15.870> start<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.200> squeeze

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.660 

you<00:03:21.819> can<00:03:21.940> see

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.020 

so<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.720> one<00:03:25.870> disadvantage<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:27.010> my<00:03:27.520> method<00:03:27.910> is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
so the one disadvantage of my method is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.240 
so the one disadvantage of my method is
it<00:03:28.240> doesn't<00:03:28.540> come<00:03:28.720> out<00:03:29.080> all<00:03:29.380> at<00:03:29.500> once<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.220> I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
it doesn't come out all at once so I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.980 
it doesn't come out all at once so I
have<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.550> keep<00:03:30.730> doing<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.150> until<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.420> feel<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
have to keep doing it until I feel the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.590 
have to keep doing it until I feel the
water<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.680> away<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.160> also<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.940> can<00:03:34.150> see<00:03:34.330> I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
water can go away and also you can see I

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.070 
water can go away and also you can see I
end<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.410> splashing<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.130> back<00:03:36.280> with<00:03:36.430> his<00:03:36.580> legs

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
end up splashing the back with his legs

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.530 
end up splashing the back with his legs
so<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:38.470> always<00:03:39.310> bring<00:03:39.430> these<00:03:39.760> Pampers<00:03:40.240> wipes

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
so I always bring these Pampers wipes

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.290 
so I always bring these Pampers wipes
out<00:03:40.810> here<00:03:41.080> with<00:03:41.200> me<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.130> get<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.550> the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
out here with me and I get the the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.570 
out here with me and I get the the
sensitive<00:03:43.810> fragrance-free<00:03:44.410> kind<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.340> it's

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
sensitive fragrance-free kind and it's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.510 
sensitive fragrance-free kind and it's
important<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.090> wipe<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.450> urine<00:03:46.780> off<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.520> the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
important to wipe the urine off of the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.250 
important to wipe the urine off of the
front<00:03:48.700> cause<00:03:48.970> because<00:03:49.270> eventually<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:49.959> will

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
front cause because eventually that will

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.250 
front cause because eventually that will
burn<00:03:50.709> their<00:03:50.950> skin<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:52.330> you'll<00:03:52.540> see<00:03:52.720> y'all<00:03:52.870> try

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
burn their skin so you'll see y'all try

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.410 
burn their skin so you'll see y'all try
this<00:03:53.320> again<00:03:53.709> I'm<00:03:54.220> holding<00:03:54.700> him<00:03:54.819> steady<00:03:55.150> with

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
this again I'm holding him steady with

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.370 
this again I'm holding him steady with
my<00:03:55.630> right<00:03:55.900> hand

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380

squeezing the dog how my method is it's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.689 
squeezing the dog how my method is it's
sort<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.229> clapping<00:04:43.620> motion<00:04:43.949> we<00:04:44.340> cants<00:04:44.610> go

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
sort of a clapping motion we cants go

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.610 
sort of a clapping motion we cants go
together<00:04:44.819> like<00:04:45.090> this<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:47.970> kind<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.270> squeeze

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
together like this and I kind of squeeze

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.050 
together like this and I kind of squeeze
like<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:50.270> so<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:52.580> you're<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.729> squeezed

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
like this so that you're in a squeezed

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.969 
like this so that you're in a squeezed
backwards<00:04:54.810> toward<00:04:55.319> the<00:04:55.440> base<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.800> penis

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
backwards toward the base of the penis

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.249 
backwards toward the base of the penis
because<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.610> piping<00:04:57.330> actually<00:04:57.599> goes<00:04:57.750> here's

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
because the piping actually goes here's

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.810 
because the piping actually goes here's
the<00:04:58.490> next<00:04:59.490> point<00:05:00.470> here's<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.560> bladder<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
the next point here's the bladder and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.820 
the next point here's the bladder and
there's<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.120> pipe<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.509> goes<00:05:03.539> around<00:05:04.289> like

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
there's a pipe that goes around like

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.650 
there's a pipe that goes around like
this<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.460> then<00:05:05.550> connects<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.120> it's<00:05:06.389> not<00:05:06.509> like

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
this and then connects and it's not like

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.950 
this and then connects and it's not like
that<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.620> squeeze<00:05:07.889> toward<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.220> back<00:05:08.960> nice

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
that so squeeze toward the back nice

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.439 
that so squeeze toward the back nice
thing<00:05:10.139> about<00:05:10.169> my<00:05:10.410> technique<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.070> that<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.849> can

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
thing about my technique is that you can

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.999 
thing about my technique is that you can
hold<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.720> dog<00:05:12.900> up<00:05:13.139> in<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.410> back<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.830> actually

you<00:06:08.699> did<00:06:08.849> a<00:06:08.880> good<00:06:09.030> job<00:06:09.090> squeezing<00:06:09.690> it<00:06:09.810> I<00:06:10.849> would

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
you did a good job squeezing it I would

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.129 
you did a good job squeezing it I would
say<00:06:12.060> it<00:06:12.240> feels<00:06:12.930> like

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.010 

it's<00:06:17.009> harder<00:06:17.280> than<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.430> water<00:06:17.580> balloon<00:06:18.020> it's

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
it's harder than a water balloon it's

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.429 
it's harder than a water balloon it's
like<00:06:19.139> if<00:06:19.229> a<00:06:19.289> water<00:06:19.439> balloons<00:06:19.830> skin<00:06:20.460> was<00:06:20.729> a

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
like if a water balloons skin was a

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.679 
like if a water balloons skin was a
centimeter<00:06:22.439> thick<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:24.240> think<00:06:24.419> we<00:06:24.539> should

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:24.689 
centimeter thick and I think we should

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.350 
centimeter thick and I think we should
his<00:06:25.110> his<00:06:25.439> tail<00:06:25.710> just<00:06:25.819> flicked<00:06:26.819> up<00:06:26.969> a<00:06:27.120> little

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
his his tail just flicked up a little

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.540 
his his tail just flicked up a little
when<00:06:27.539> you<00:06:27.659> touched<00:06:27.930> his<00:06:28.139> bladder<00:06:28.379> that's<00:06:29.129> also

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
when you touched his bladder that's also

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.119 
when you touched his bladder that's also
a<00:06:30.389> sign<00:06:30.930> that<00:06:30.960> you're<00:06:31.259> touching<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.979> right
