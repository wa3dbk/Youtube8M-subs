00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.850
 Let's go 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.090
 I will make the reason for using the card to succeed 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.810
 It is today I Anoma little 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.160
 But I Well new solder 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.300
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.300
 First of all 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:03.280
 It is usually such a Dicky, but this is yeah office 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.809
 I'm limited but I'm sorry I'm this cell 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 eee 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.040
 this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.170
 It's Kamesensin, so change it to Kamesensin. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.260
 a If you make a mistake 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 Usually this 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.990
 If it is a combination, it can be pulled out with a web trunks 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:27.290
 vegeta Vegeta This kind of combination is that most of them are over- subscribing 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.560
 It's there as 1, and can kill 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.659
 Around 30,000 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.510
 I can do more than 35,000 damage, but with this deck 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.940
 I want to change this sale completely 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.340
 40,000 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:50.880
 There aren't 5000 or so 10,000 or so damage is about to happen. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.909
 So yes a magic If you want to aim 300,000 more than you want to aim Toka You know if score Well 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.990
 30 more if you are a member of Kamisen 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.859
 It's about 20,000 . If you match that hiroro with yourself , then No. 32 goes to a. 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.900
 This age mission 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:11.400
 Well this is a really easy combination because you write who I am 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.799
 For example Well In short, now it's free mission Well then first 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.610
 That hero can not be used somehow It is magnificent and it is ah 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:24.569
 Well, I think there are people thinking about it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.990
 On whether the Well usually had a hell of a formidable enemy it went the other way card 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.860
 Well I ate Ina Road and I managed to do something 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.300
 Put Toka do it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.660
 Like this, I will create a combination of twins and so on 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.890
 This is why I made this 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.880
 It is a deck to make it a cam scene in 40,000 seconds 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.540
 Being old 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.569
 Damage about 10,090 yen is given, yes 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.689
 So it's usually a hard mission, two 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:01.920
 I can not afford enough-I can kill one more I think maybe I also boss system but I already have boss 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:05.420
 I do not know a little but Nde Oh not that Sir challenge 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.520
 It is not at all ok if half sphere Yes 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.250
 so 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:17.520
 Oh sorry one more thing 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:19.640
 Now Well this is when the First 19,000 other than the enemy Ya good Konojikkuwatto 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.430
 The enemy or less than nine people 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.610
 Another one 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.330
 that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.960
 Deck stunned to have enemy went this case you were an enemy that can not be wound or say not even one person 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.320
 is not it 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:38.390
 If I make this one deck a success 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.610
 However, I think that I understand if I look at my play video side etc. 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.940
 But that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.860
 Now Metal Cooler Yes Petal Cooler That 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.390
 east 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.050
 You can head there, is not it or that hard guy a mission a little place of 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.569
 so 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:00.409
 Well get move and then I put this in 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.670
 In such a combination such as Toshiba September 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:09.920
 It's Yes Well Toshiba September hate to separate from Vegeta 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.600
 But it's okay, but I think that Vegeta can do damage , but I'm the government. 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.390
 I 'm out 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.720

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.410
 When I write it, I do double damage and it's high 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.310
 Kore certainly enters 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.830
 Nearly 30,000 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.580

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.440
 This is hey 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.409
 That's a really central deck Well this is 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.520
 It is strong if successful it is that strong I do one kill to be able to second place 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.830
 That Well Kore 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.620
 Well the condition of this deck 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.569
 You can faint 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.660
 It is when there is an enemy 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.780

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.080
