technique<00:00:15.410> about<00:00:16.410> 600<00:00:17.010> millimeter<00:00:17.369> lens

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
technique about 600 millimeter lens

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
technique about 600 millimeter lens
hooked<00:00:18.869> up<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> 2x<00:00:19.800> teleconverter<00:00:20.720> hooked

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
hooked up to a 2x teleconverter hooked

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.000 
hooked up to a 2x teleconverter hooked
up<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.410> canon<00:00:22.980> camera<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.800> we<00:00:25.800> got

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
up to a little canon camera and we got

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300 
up to a little canon camera and we got
about<00:00:26.720> close<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.869> 2,000<00:00:28.500> millimetres<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:29.039> this

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
about close to 2,000 millimetres on this

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.830 
about close to 2,000 millimetres on this
and<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> teleconverter<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.660> really

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and with a teleconverter it's really

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.940 
and with a teleconverter it's really
difficult<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.650> get<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.700> autofocus<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> put

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
difficult to get at autofocus so I put

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100 
difficult to get at autofocus so I put
the<00:00:35.070> camera<00:00:35.250> manual<00:00:35.760> focus<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.750> sorry<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the camera manual focus or sorry the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
the camera manual focus or sorry the
lens<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.469> manual<00:00:37.800> focus<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.340> turned<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.300> them

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
lens of manual focus I turned off them

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
lens of manual focus I turned off them
stabilization<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> locked<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> tripod<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
stabilization I locked down the tripod I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
stabilization I locked down the tripod I
put<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> camera<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.960> live<00:00:43.140> view<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
put the camera into live view and I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
put the camera into live view and I
zoomed<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:44.879> 10x<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.570> live<00:00:45.780> view<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> I'm

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
zoomed into 10x on live view and I'm

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.950 
zoomed into 10x on live view and I'm
focused<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> macaws<00:00:48.120> eye<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
focused on the macaws eye right so you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
focused on the macaws eye right so you
got<00:00:49.140> real<00:00:49.320> critical<00:00:49.770> focus<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.000> hit

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
got real critical focus then I hit

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
got real critical focus then I hit
record<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.890> staying<00:00:53.250> real<00:00:53.520> still<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
record this I'm staying real still so it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.930 
record this I'm staying real still so it
doesn't<00:00:55.949> vibrate<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.370> camera<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.850> we're

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
doesn't vibrate the camera and we're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.880 
doesn't vibrate the camera and we're
filming<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> macaws<00:00:58.140> even<00:00:58.530> their<00:00:58.649> clay<00:00:58.890> a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
filming the macaws even their clay a

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.869 
filming the macaws even their clay a
good<00:01:01.890> tip<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.520> using<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
good tip when you're using a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
good tip when you're using a
teleconverter<00:01:03.449> sometimes<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
teleconverter sometimes the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
teleconverter sometimes the
teleconverters<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.489> cause<00:01:05.670> vignette<00:01:06.240> ii<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
teleconverters can cause vignette ii and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
teleconverters can cause vignette ii and
that's<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> darkening<00:01:07.470> around<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> edges<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that's the darkening around the edges of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
that's the darkening around the edges of
the<00:01:08.820> frame<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.630> such<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> big<00:01:10.110> deal<00:01:10.170> when

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the frame it's not such a big deal when

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
the frame it's not such a big deal when
you're<00:01:10.740> using<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.040> crop<00:01:11.280> sensor<00:01:11.520> sometimes<00:01:12.360> i'm

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you're using a crop sensor sometimes i'm

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
you're using a crop sensor sometimes i'm
full-frame<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.549> i<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.670> i

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
full-frame you get that so what i do i

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.440 
full-frame you get that so what i do i
stop<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:15.659> f/8<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.729> sometimes<00:01:17.729> f11<00:01:18.360> i

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
stop down from f/8 to sometimes f11 i

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
stop down from f/8 to sometimes f11 i
just<00:01:18.659> stop<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.990> down<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.920> gets

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just stop it down a little bit it gets

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
just stop it down a little bit it gets
rid<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> vignette<00:01:20.820> ii<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.150> also<00:01:21.360> makes<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
rid of the vignette ii it also makes the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
rid of the vignette ii it also makes the
picture<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.409> sharper<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.610> i'm

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
picture a little bit sharper so i'm

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
picture a little bit sharper so i'm
shooting<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> f11<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.189> once

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
shooting it f11 on this one so once

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
shooting it f11 on this one so once
everything<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.759> aligned<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.960> hit

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
everything is aligned but just hit

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890 
everything is aligned but just hit
record<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.549> start<00:01:29.820> start<00:01:30.570> doing<00:01:30.810> our
