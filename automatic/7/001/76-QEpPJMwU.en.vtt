00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
by now you notice the brake line now

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.259 
by now you notice the brake line now
make<00:00:27.390> zoom<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> second<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
make zoom in for here a second you

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.299 
make zoom in for here a second you
notice<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.619> rubbing<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
notice all that that rubbing on the

notice all that that rubbing on the
plastic<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.020> on

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
plastic there that is because this is on

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.549 
plastic there that is because this is on
the<00:00:37.290> wrong<00:00:37.440> side<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:39.930> supposed

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the wrong side it is actually supposed

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
the wrong side it is actually supposed
to<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.040> behind<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.790> spring<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> strut

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to be up behind the spring and the strut

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
to be up behind the spring and the strut
there<00:00:43.160> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.550> said<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
there this is like I said this is a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.080 
there this is like I said this is a
common<00:00:45.149> issue<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.899> put<00:00:46.079> new<00:00:46.200> brakes<00:00:46.469> on

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
common issue when they put new brakes on

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
common issue when they put new brakes on
somehow<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> caliper<00:00:48.809> gets<00:00:49.219> twisted<00:00:50.219> around

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
somehow the caliper gets twisted around

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
somehow the caliper gets twisted around
so<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> show<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.239> quickly<00:00:51.539> how<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
flip that because this has been like

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
flip that because this has been like
this<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.050> five<00:00:55.410> years<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.070> car<00:00:56.280> I

these 14 millimeter bolts in the back

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.600 
these 14 millimeter bolts in the back
here<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.060> different<00:01:15.090> sizes

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
here there are two different sizes

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.719 
here there are two different sizes
diameters<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> careful<00:01:18.750> on

diameters so you want to be careful on

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
diameters so you want to be careful on
putting<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> top<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.170> here

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
get it off here we go and San tightened

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.410 
get it off here we go and San tightened
already<00:01:34.730> is<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.940> little<00:01:35.720> bit<00:01:35.840> thinner<00:01:37.420> show

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
already is a little bit thinner show

easy way to fix this it's pretty much to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.530 
easy way to fix this it's pretty much to
remove<00:01:46.730> this<00:01:47.030> off<00:01:48.430> flip<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.550> around<00:01:49.670> there

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
remove this off flip it around there

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
remove this off flip it around there
like<00:01:50.570> one<00:01:50.900> little<00:01:51.260> spin<00:01:51.620> that's<00:01:52.040> what<00:01:52.250> happens

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
like one little spin that's what happens

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.550 
like one little spin that's what happens
when<00:01:52.820> they<00:01:54.670> put<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:56.000> wrong<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:57.410> like

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
when they put this on wrong it's like

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.240 
when they put this on wrong it's like
that<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:59.390> then<00:01:59.720> stick<00:01:59.930> it<00:01:59.990> back<00:02:00.140> up<00:02:00.350> stick<00:02:01.190> it

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that and then stick it back up stick it

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.630 
that and then stick it back up stick it
back<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.350> actually<00:02:04.280> how<00:02:04.460> it's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
back on that is actually how it's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.949 
back on that is actually how it's
supposed<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> sit<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.340> all<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.600> help<00:02:08.840> to

any scraping when they have their wheels
all<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> way<00:02:14.959> turned<00:02:15.170> around<00:02:15.380> that's<00:02:15.740> why<00:02:16.040> I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
all the way turned around that's why I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.740 
all the way turned around that's why I
had<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:16.940> why<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.180> was<00:02:17.300> trying<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.540> figure

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
had that's why I was trying to figure

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.900 
had that's why I was trying to figure
this<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.020> there's<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.320> lot<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> scraping

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
this out there's a lot of scraping

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.420 
this out there's a lot of scraping
especially<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.330> passenger<00:02:21.020> side<00:02:21.430> it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
especially on the passenger side it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.710 
especially on the passenger side it's
actually<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.790> same<00:02:22.970> side<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.480> driver

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
actually the same side on the driver

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.720 
actually the same side on the driver
side<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.230> didn't<00:02:24.620> feel<00:02:24.739> here<00:02:25.070> any<00:02:25.250> that

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
side I just didn't feel here any that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.580 
side I just didn't feel here any that
much<00:02:25.910> scraping<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.750> I'm<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.440> go<00:02:27.500> ahead

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
much scraping so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.800 
much scraping so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:27.739> bolt<00:02:27.890> everything<00:02:28.160> back<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.630> I'm<00:02:29.630> actually

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and bolt everything back up I'm actually

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
and bolt everything back up I'm actually
going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> clean<00:02:30.320> these<00:02:30.500> off<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:32.000> well

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
going to clean these off really well

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.509 
going to clean these off really well

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
before I put everything back up as it's

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.280
