00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
four black wool and four white wool and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.789 
four black wool and four white wool and
I'm<00:02:57.630> pretty<00:02:57.900> sure<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.350> shapeless<00:02:58.769> recipe

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
I'm pretty sure it's a shapeless recipe

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.650 
I'm pretty sure it's a shapeless recipe
so<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.310> guys<00:02:59.519> can<00:02:59.700> put<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.120> however<00:03:00.360> you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so you guys can put it in however you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.539 
so you guys can put it in however you
would<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.860> should<00:03:02.069> come<00:03:02.190> out<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
would like and it should come out with a

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.550 
would like and it should come out with a
chessboard<00:03:02.880> piece<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.049> we<00:03:04.170> go<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:04.440> got

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
chessboard piece so there we go we got

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
chessboard piece so there we go we got
that<00:03:04.830> now<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.519> make<00:03:05.880> your<00:03:06.090> actual<00:03:06.450> chessboard

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that now to make your actual chessboard

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.009 
that now to make your actual chessboard
generator<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.560> need<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.980> full<00:03:08.900> crafting<00:03:09.900> bench

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
generator you need a full crafting bench

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.120 
generator you need a full crafting bench
full<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:12.530> chessboard<00:03:13.530> columns<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.010> should

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
full of chessboard columns which should

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.229 
full of chessboard columns which should
give<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.280> your<00:03:14.340> generator<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
give you your generator and like I

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.550 
give you your generator and like I
showed<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.420> guys<00:03:15.660> previously<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.380> use

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
showed you guys previously you can use

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280 
showed you guys previously you can use
that<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.250> spawn<00:03:17.579> your<00:03:18.030> actual<00:03:18.540> chessboard<00:03:19.140> so

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.790 
like jumps up into the air and plops
down<00:05:51.089> right<00:05:51.270> where<00:05:51.389> he<00:05:51.479> needs<00:05:51.629> to<00:05:51.719> go<00:05:51.899> so<00:05:52.080> every

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
down right where he needs to go so every

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.019 
down right where he needs to go so every
piece<00:05:53.039> can<00:05:53.310> go<00:05:53.460> in<00:05:53.639> a<00:05:53.699> different<00:05:53.729> direction

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
piece can go in a different direction

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.639 
piece can go in a different direction
obviously<00:05:54.689> it's<00:05:54.810> not<00:05:54.960> just<00:05:55.199> like<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.349> pawns

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:55.649 
obviously it's not just like the pawns

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.409 
obviously it's not just like the pawns
can<00:05:55.919> go<00:05:56.069> one<00:05:56.310> direction<00:05:56.789> and<00:05:56.879> that's<00:05:57.029> it<00:05:57.270> it's

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
can go one direction and that's it it's

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.540 
can go one direction and that's it it's
like<00:05:57.599> a<00:05:57.750> fully<00:05:58.379> working<00:05:58.889> chessboard<00:05:59.430> in

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
like a fully working chessboard in

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.429 
like a fully working chessboard in
Minecraft<00:06:00.029> which<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.330> totally<00:06:00.839> awesome<00:06:00.870> and

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:01.439 
Minecraft which is totally awesome and

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.010 
Minecraft which is totally awesome and
let's<00:06:02.099> see<00:06:02.279> if<00:06:02.430> any<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.699> our<00:06:03.029> other<00:06:03.389> big<00:06:03.689> pieces

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
let's see if any of our other big pieces

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.260 
let's see if any of our other big pieces
can<00:06:04.319> move<00:06:04.469> anywhere<00:06:04.710> I'll<00:06:04.919> try<00:06:05.129> this<00:06:05.189> guy<00:06:05.460> all

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
right so he can just go that way but

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.240 
right so he can just go that way but
yeah<00:06:09.029> let's<00:06:09.539> just<00:06:09.689> go<00:06:09.810> ahead<00:06:09.899> and<00:06:10.110> suicide<00:06:10.949> one
