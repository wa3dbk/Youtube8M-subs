00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
bolas can restrain their targets which I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.609 
bolas can restrain their targets which I
will<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.390> putting<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.840> clips<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> end<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
will be putting some clips at the end of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.649 
will be putting some clips at the end of
video<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.399> restraining<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:38.970> targets<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
video of me restraining my targets and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
video of me restraining my targets and
that<00:01:40.259> guy<00:01:40.409> has<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> staff<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> light<00:01:41.189> that's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that guy has a staff of light that's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
that guy has a staff of light that's
blue<00:01:41.790> looks<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.420> cool<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.820> effectiveness

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
blue looks really cool the effectiveness

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.230 
blue looks really cool the effectiveness
of<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.560> restrain<00:01:47.070> depends<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> low

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of this restrain depends on like the low

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.539 
of this restrain depends on like the low
or<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.110> target<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
or what the target is so if it's like a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
or what the target is so if it's like a
player<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.509> works<00:01:51.810> better<00:01:52.049> than<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
player it works better than like on a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.209 
player it works better than like on a
boss<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:54.200> they're<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.229> effective<00:01:55.920> against

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
boss so they're very effective against

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.160 
boss so they're very effective against
mutated<00:01:56.610> gene<00:01:56.759> eco<00:01:57.000> creatures<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.780> inside

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
mutated gene eco creatures so inside

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
mutated gene eco creatures so inside
there<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.820> more<00:02:00.060> effective<00:02:00.299> so

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there then on it it's more effective so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
there then on it it's more effective so
you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.259> hold<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.770> longer<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.130> maybe

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you can hold them for longer and maybe

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
you can hold them for longer and maybe
hits<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.750> another<00:02:04.200> player<00:02:04.530> boss<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.130> be

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
hits more on another player boss can be

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.880 
hits more on another player boss can be
blocked<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:06.030> hold<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:07.409> other<00:02:07.560> player

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
blocked and will hold the other player

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.930 
blocked and will hold the other player
for<00:02:08.130> 15<00:02:08.550> seconds<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.700> does

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for 15 seconds so if like all this does

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.550 
for 15 seconds so if like all this does
is<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.600> stunning<00:02:13.020> thing<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
is it's like a stunning thing it's a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560 
is it's like a stunning thing it's a
weapon<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.190> people<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.700> good<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:15.120> PvP

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
weapon to some people it's good for PvP

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.660 
weapon to some people it's good for PvP
or<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> need<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.770> run<00:02:16.890> away<00:02:17.010> from<00:02:17.160> someone

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
or if you need to run away from someone

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.570 
or if you need to run away from someone
so<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.480> pretty<00:02:18.780> good<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.040> other

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so it is pretty good but if the other

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.600 
so it is pretty good but if the other
player<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.090> willing<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.610> protecting

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
player is willing or is protecting

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.750 
player is willing or is protecting
deflect<00:02:24.000> missiles<00:02:24.540> or

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
deflect missiles or

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.070 
deflect missiles or
whatever<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.150> cursed<00:02:27.599> thing<00:02:27.840> is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
whatever the other cursed thing is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.979 
whatever the other cursed thing is
protect<00:02:28.950> from<00:02:29.099> missiles<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.360> time<00:02:30.750> is

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
protect from missiles then the time is

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.510 
protect from missiles then the time is
reduced<00:02:31.110> halfway<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> instead<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.319> being<00:02:34.560> 15

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
reduced halfway so instead of a being 15

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.160 
reduced halfway so instead of a being 15
in<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> least<00:02:35.970> 7.5<00:02:37.430> seconds<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.550> hold<00:02:38.989> also<00:02:39.989> if

in the least 7.5 seconds of hold also if

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
in the least 7.5 seconds of hold also if
the<00:02:40.260> player<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.530> building<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> slash<00:02:41.340> weapon<00:02:41.760> or

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the player is building a slash weapon or

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.089 
the player is building a slash weapon or

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.930 
has a knife in their inventory the time
will<00:02:44.280> also<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.670> halved<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:47.310> two<00:02:47.489> effects

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
will also be halved and the two effects

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.300 
will also be halved and the two effects
stack<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.019> they<00:02:49.200> are<00:02:49.260> using<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.860> knife<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
stack so if they are using a knife and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.600 
stack so if they are using a knife and
protecting<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.569> cutting<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.950> bind<00:02:53.160> time<00:02:53.370> is

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
protecting then cutting the bind time is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.559 
protecting then cutting the bind time is
a<00:02:53.640> minimum<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.269> five<00:02:54.569> seconds<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.550> maximum<00:02:56.569> on

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
Armas use these I'd never really use

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
Armas use these I'd never really use
them<00:03:20.430> yet<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.209> mean<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.660> look<00:03:22.080> at<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> video<00:03:22.319> or

them yet but I mean I look at a video or
something<00:03:23.989> these<00:03:24.989> are<00:03:25.290> highly<00:03:25.620> accurate<00:03:25.980> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
something these are highly accurate so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.880 
something these are highly accurate so
you<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> good<00:03:28.349> chance<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.739> actually
