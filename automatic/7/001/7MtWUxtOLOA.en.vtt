00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
basically this game is about guessing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
basically this game is about guessing
two<00:00:26.189> words<00:00:26.430> based<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.970> two<00:00:27.240> pictures<00:00:27.720> it's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
two words based on two pictures it's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
two words based on two pictures it's
very<00:00:28.890> similar<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> puzzle<00:00:30.000> games

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
very similar to some of the puzzle games

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
very similar to some of the puzzle games
already<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> App<00:00:31.320> Store<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.399> takes<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
already on the App Store but it takes a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.530 
already on the App Store but it takes a
whole<00:00:33.300> new<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.850> how<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> guess<00:00:36.239> these<00:00:36.480> two

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
whole new take on how to guess these two

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
whole new take on how to guess these two
words<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.559> you'll<00:00:37.950> start<00:00:38.219> off<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.610> two

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
words so you'll start off with two

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.260 
words so you'll start off with two
pictures<00:00:40.550> one<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> left<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pictures one on the left one on the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
pictures one on the left one on the
right<00:00:42.360> sometimes<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.460> top

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
right sometimes it's going to be on top

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
right sometimes it's going to be on top
and<00:00:44.940> bottom<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.780> doesn't<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.140> matter<00:00:46.440> but

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and bottom it doesn't really matter but

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
and bottom it doesn't really matter but
the<00:00:47.309> idea<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.719> picture<00:00:49.110> represents

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the idea is that one picture represents

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
the idea is that one picture represents
one<00:00:50.280> word<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> another<00:00:51.030> picture<00:00:51.510> represents

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
one word and another picture represents

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
one word and another picture represents
another<00:00:52.469> word<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.090> example<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:55.260> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
another word so in this example we have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
another word so in this example we have
a<00:00:55.800> witch<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> doctor<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
a witch and we have a doctor in and it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.270 
a witch and we have a doctor in and it's
usually<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.590> clever<00:00:59.070> play<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.460> words<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
usually a clever play on words that you

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
usually a clever play on words that you
will<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> guess<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.280> generally<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
will have to guess and generally the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
will have to guess and generally the
words<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:06.060> rather<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> letters<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.229> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
words or rather the letters down here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
words or rather the letters down here
are<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.310> alphabetical<00:01:09.000> order<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> go

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
are in alphabetical order and you can go

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.219 
are in alphabetical order and you can go
ahead<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> scramble<00:01:10.830> them<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.840> by<00:01:12.960> shaking

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
ahead and scramble them just by shaking

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.090 
ahead and scramble them just by shaking
your<00:01:13.470> device<00:01:14.210> like<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> let's<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.009> ahead

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
your device like so so let's go ahead

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120 
your device like so so let's go ahead
and<00:01:17.250> try<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> guess<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:19.130> combinations

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and try to guess of these combinations

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
and try to guess of these combinations
and<00:01:20.670> we'll<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.420> type<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> glitch<00:01:26.090> oops<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and we'll just type in glitch oops we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
and we'll just type in glitch oops we
missed<00:01:29.780> letters<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
missed letters there we go and the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.359 
missed letters there we go and the
answer<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> witch<00:01:33.240> doctor<00:01:34.009> that's<00:01:35.009> pretty

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
answer is witch doctor that's pretty

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
answer is witch doctor that's pretty
cool<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.479> encounter<00:01:36.810> these

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
cool and you will encounter these

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
total coins are displayed in the top

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.050

right<00:01:59.579> here

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
right here

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.190 
right here
so<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> by<00:02:01.290> looking<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.509> photo<00:02:03.509> let's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so just by looking at this photo let's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.339 
so just by looking at this photo let's
go<00:02:04.350> ahead<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.829> guess<00:02:06.320> claim<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> first

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:19.070 

perhaps<00:02:13.349> plane<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:18.209> plain<00:02:18.690> pizza

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
perhaps plane like this and plain pizza

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.680 
perhaps plane like this and plain pizza
so<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.610> plane<00:02:21.030> isn't<00:02:21.269> spelled

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so as you can see a plane isn't spelled

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.720 
so as you can see a plane isn't spelled
correctly<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.069> whole<00:02:23.280> point<00:02:23.549> of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
correctly but that's the whole point of

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:36.559 
correctly but that's the whole point of
