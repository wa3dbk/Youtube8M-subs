spaces<00:01:09.590> well<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:10.070> like<00:01:10.250> Tabasco<00:01:11.030> tabasco<00:01:11.450> is

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
spaces well I'm like Tabasco tabasco is

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.260 
spaces well I'm like Tabasco tabasco is
just<00:01:11.930> heat<00:01:12.620> where<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.490> heat<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:13.970> flavor

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
just heat where this is heat and flavor

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.820 
just heat where this is heat and flavor
so<00:01:14.540> we're<00:01:14.659> trying<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.900> get<00:01:15.020> as<00:01:15.229> much<00:01:15.620> flavor

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
so we're trying to get as much flavor

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.190 
so we're trying to get as much flavor
into<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.400> glass<00:01:16.580> as<00:01:16.909> possible<00:01:17.479> I'm<00:01:18.020> going<00:01:18.140> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
into the glass as possible I'm going to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.890 
into the glass as possible I'm going to
do<00:01:18.350> my<00:01:18.380> four<00:01:18.799> dashes<00:01:19.010> of<00:01:19.280> worship<00:01:19.909> we're<00:01:20.810> going

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
do my four dashes of worship we're going

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.760 
do my four dashes of worship we're going
to<00:01:20.990> put<00:01:21.140> some<00:01:21.170> fresh<00:01:21.650> crack<00:01:22.180> salt<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.390> pepper

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
to put some fresh crack salt and pepper

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.680 
to put some fresh crack salt and pepper
so<00:01:24.770> always<00:01:25.130> fresh<00:01:25.549> does<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.940> taste<00:01:26.120> that<00:01:26.510> much

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
so always fresh does it taste that much

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.080 
so always fresh does it taste that much
better<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:28.310> here's<00:01:28.670> where<00:01:28.850> we're<00:01:28.970> actually

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
better so here's where we're actually

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.980 
better so here's where we're actually
going<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.450> doing<00:01:29.540> a<00:01:29.659> little<00:01:29.810> bit<00:01:29.960> of

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to be doing a little bit of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.600 
going to be doing a little bit of
muddling<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.830> when<00:01:31.040> you're<00:01:31.159> muddling<00:01:31.340> you're

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
muddling so when you're muddling you're
