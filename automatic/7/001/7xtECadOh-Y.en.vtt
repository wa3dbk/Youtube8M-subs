first one I bought was refurbished which

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
first one I bought was refurbished which
basically<00:00:54.899> means<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.610> someone<00:00:56.610> else<00:00:56.730> has

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
basically means that someone else has

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.380 
basically means that someone else has
had<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.680> returned<00:00:59.160> it<00:01:02.000> yeah<00:01:03.000> because

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
had it and then returned it yeah because

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
had it and then returned it yeah because
