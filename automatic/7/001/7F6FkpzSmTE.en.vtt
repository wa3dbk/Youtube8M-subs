00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
that world it'll just droop or like if

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.400 
that world it'll just droop or like if
you<00:05:02.830> breathe<00:05:03.160> but<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.229> fairly<00:05:05.229> loose

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
problems I didn't like I don't know

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.110 
problems I didn't like I don't know
other<00:06:51.539> people's<00:06:51.930> are<00:06:52.050> like<00:06:52.550> but<00:06:53.550> mine<00:06:53.909> you

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
other people's are like but mine you

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.279

know having those loose joints is an

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.640 
know having those loose joints is an
issue<00:06:55.469> for<00:06:55.650> me<00:06:56.509> but<00:06:57.509> if<00:06:57.689> you<00:06:57.719> like<00:06:58.050> Shadowmoon

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
issue for me but if you like Shadowmoon

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.800 
issue for me but if you like Shadowmoon
it's<00:06:58.949> still<00:06:59.279> probably<00:06:59.580> unless<00:07:00.330> you<00:07:00.539> get<00:07:00.629> like

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
it's still probably unless you get like

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.239 
it's still probably unless you get like
a<00:07:00.840> project<00:07:01.319> BM<00:07:01.590> which<00:07:01.740> i<00:07:01.860> don't<00:07:01.979> know<00:07:02.009> if<00:07:02.129> there

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
a project BM which i don't know if there

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.429 
a project BM which i don't know if there
is<00:07:02.279> one<00:07:02.550> the<00:07:03.060> best<00:07:03.300> representation<00:07:03.930> of<00:07:04.259> him

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
is one the best representation of him

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.189 
is one the best representation of him
but<00:07:05.310> he's<00:07:05.849> just<00:07:06.060> overall<00:07:06.509> he's<00:07:06.749> a<00:07:06.779> mediocre

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
but he's just overall he's a mediocre

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.110 
but he's just overall he's a mediocre
figure<00:07:07.770> for<00:07:08.069> me<00:07:08.189> he's<00:07:08.400> probably<00:07:08.639> in<00:07:08.969> the

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
figure for me he's probably in the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.469 
figure for me he's probably in the
middle<00:07:09.360> tier<00:07:09.629> of<00:07:09.659> my<00:07:09.960> my<00:07:10.710> figure<00:07:11.129> arts

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
middle tier of my my figure arts

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.480 
middle tier of my my figure arts
collection<00:07:12.479> he's<00:07:12.750> just<00:07:13.050> kind<00:07:13.349> of<00:07:13.469> a<00:07:13.620> matte

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
collection he's just kind of a matte
