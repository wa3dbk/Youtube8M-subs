00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 this adventure this is it starts to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 from today for me this is the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.820
 better choice necessarily so it's 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.100
 really a beautiful story that starts 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.260
 the victory is not like that and 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.369
 when you have the ingredients there 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.890
 must put the means and that's where he 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.170
 have to go 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.849
 it's more than a symbol it's a real 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.550
 continuity in any case on the part of 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.680
 yamaha motor france to want 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.820
 get involved in competition and so 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.590
 today we are not going to make 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.220
 the figuration is clear and we go 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.220
 to seek victory 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.900
 it was very nice to ride the same 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.160
 day with Cyril and exchanging the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.159
 motorcycles by wanting once with the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.550
 new generation 450 the old of 80 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.449
 18 and a good time of pleasure and of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.449
 piloting share 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.940
 that's done also thanks to a pilot of 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.810
 at yamaha stÃ©phane peterhansel who 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 following a discussion said so here so 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.610
 someone has to beat my record or 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.870
 illegal and I would like accessory 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.190
 you or at least that it is you and then 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.050
 if you can do it with a yamaha 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.260
 would be even better he's really at 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.119
 top of its top shape would rally it's 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.710
 a very complete pilot navigation 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.460
 physical technique strategy and that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.229
 today ben there are not many 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 in the world of rally raid which are at 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.390
 his level so it's really very very 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.330
 well why why because with a 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.770
 evidence evidence around the man from 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.210
 the quality of his commitment the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.539
 knowledge that he obviously has dakar 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.619
 and then talent so talent you 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.810
 know when you're lucky to have 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.920
 a motorcycle or as a builder 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.840
 you're sure she has the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.580
 potential to win you have to go 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.350
 look for the driver who is capable of the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.149
 save and I think today 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.840
 Cyril has all the talent and all the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 abilities to do it 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 I am passionate about dakar and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.909
 I know the story to parker but I 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.090
 have known the history of the dakar since 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.509
 his beginnings I know the nephews the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.950
 bins or ways 10 and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.579
 the firecrackers in the saddle and other and 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.439
 especially jean claude olivier who when 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.459
 same writing and does a lot for the 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.439
 dakar is a lot for the brand 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.860
 today it's just an honor to 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:27.930
 to be able to enter through the big door in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.930
 a great team like Yamaha
