00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.280
 more information on xbox one in this 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.830
 occasion has spoken the founder of atari 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.590
 that thinks that microsoft the cago 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.750
 literally in the presentation of xbox 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.420
 one nobody is silent around their 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 opinions of this microsoft console 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.109
 Well, not the two in it are more 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.539
 important in the industry of 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.340
 founder of atari has spoken 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.039
 of your feelings about the presentation 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.880
 of xbox one as well as the market 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.769
 second hand 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.019
 bazÃ¡n he thinks that with the presentation 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.909
 of the new microsoft console the 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.400
 shit all said the following 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.979
 when I hear some of the announcements and 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.530
 As they analyzed them, I started to deny 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.629
 head and say that milk are 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.549
 thinking clearly that that was not going to 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.799
 come out well in addition the founder of atari 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:54.049
 he also thinks that the second hand is 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.690
 good and brings more money says what 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.119
 next I think in many ways 50 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.739
 dollars cuts the pace of sales in 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.119
 definitive what he wanted to say is 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 that there are more people who can not 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.770
 afford to buy the games at a price 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.079
 of launch there are more people of that type 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.230
 that people who acquire titles by 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.700
 so to say it at gold prices 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.890
 the launch day says the following 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.110
 I think the industry receives more money 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.970
 if you look at it as a set since 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.740
 I think people will spend what 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.050
 can and if you put too many 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.180
 obstacles to people who are not so 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.830
 well financially just do not 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.750
 they will be able to buy the game of any 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.670
 way in fact I think it has quite 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.440
 reason great example of it is barry 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 Martin an expert user 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.710
 microeconomy gets big 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.510
 game collections 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.700
 that yes adjusting to its own 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.740
 budget and if you have to wait then 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.900
 waits meanwhile barry burton is 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 grab a technique the technique of 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.800
 pendrive anyway this news is 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.870
 more than important since the founder of 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 atari let's not forget that from a first 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.470
 moment he said he thought that 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.420
 microsoft would win the new generation 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.810
 and look at the statements that are 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.810
 doing now
