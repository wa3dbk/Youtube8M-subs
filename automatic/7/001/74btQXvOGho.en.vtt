00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.400
 in Stuttgart welcomed the asset manager Georg Thilenius what 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:06.910
 say to these success numbers 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.379
 the waters that is already a mature achievement 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.939
 a turnover-plus of 80% and to a doubling of profits there is only very whole 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.949
 Rarely does this happen once a year to any of the larger ones 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.519
 Company that shows so that the product is right the price is right and 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.419
 also the delivery capability of the company 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.849
 is because it is yes you have to produce the whole product and so 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.399
 could bring 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.749
 At this rate of growth, one can become more dizzy almost this one 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.030
 Tempo for keeping up a fashion 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.890
 No, the pace will not be sustained so 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 We also have to look Apple now has nearly 25 billion in sales 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.250
 What could also be expected Apple would have a turnover of $ 100 billion 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.690
 that is very very big also the market capitalization is so big that 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.260
 The two can hardly be significantly increased accordingly 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 Outlook had been a bit cautious 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.070
 Since January, company founder Steve Jobs year falls out due to illness 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 this quarterly results proves that it goes without jobs Baierbrunn 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.090
 it works 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 It's not just a bliss No, companies with a hundred billion 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.820
 Turnover can not be a one-man show behind now believe it without having to 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.189
 many thousands of product development engineers are the ones to see 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.390
 even if jobs should turn out longer, the company can continue to do so 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.229
 always as long as the products are running because technology company OHB Technology 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.799
 There are often short-lived the short model cycles and the short-lived 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.700
 Lie are also subject to the most modern you have to be very very careful in the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.760
 location 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 We see the further prospects for the Apple share 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.060
 the app which also has more prospects are fine 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.340
 We are especially pleased that the price-earnings ratio is just over 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.720
 13 for the biggest win of the year 2012 last year that too 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.500
 but the air races will not develop so fast 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.439
 can be like in the mixed went the last couple of years because somewhere is 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 the limit Apple already has nearly as large a market capitalization 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.920
 like Textron mobil is bigger than Steiner Elektrik and so is after 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.500
 Traditionally, the lid on top of it is pretty big on the rise 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.179
 not maybe ten percent a year 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.109
