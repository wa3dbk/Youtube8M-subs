took<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.700> integrated<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> scope<00:01:54.960> eyepiece

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
took and integrated the scope eyepiece

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
took and integrated the scope eyepiece
into<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> body<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> scope<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
into the body of the scope so now it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330 
into the body of the scope so now it's
you<00:01:57.630> cannot<00:01:57.960> remove<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.189> did

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you cannot remove it but what we did

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.920 
you cannot remove it but what we did
since<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> are<00:01:59.790> able<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> push<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> optics

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
since we are able to push the optics

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.910 
since we are able to push the optics
closer<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> 25<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.969> 60<00:02:03.920> zoom

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
closer now we have a 25 to 60 zoom

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.609 
closer now we have a 25 to 60 zoom
eyepiece<00:02:05.340> big<00:02:06.180> field<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.630> view<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.500> they

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
eyepiece big field of view and then they

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
eyepiece big field of view and then they
add<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.920> extra<00:02:08.250> benefit<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.179> eyeglass

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
add an extra benefit for eyeglass

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
add an extra benefit for eyeglass
viewers<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.289> make<00:02:10.470> 20<00:02:11.099> millimetres<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
viewers like you make 20 millimetres of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.190 
viewers like you make 20 millimetres of
eye<00:02:11.760> relief<00:02:12.090> throughout<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> entire<00:02:12.870> zone

eye relief throughout the entire zone

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.050 
eye relief throughout the entire zone
range<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.129> you're<00:02:14.250> wearing<00:02:14.459> glasses<00:02:14.790> or

even sunglasses on a bright sunny day

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
even sunglasses on a bright sunny day
you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> perfect<00:02:17.730> field<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.269> view<00:02:18.360> no

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you can get a perfect field of view no

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.619 
you can get a perfect field of view no
matter<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.280> also<00:02:20.280> since<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> eyepiece

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
matter what also since now the eyepiece

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.449 
matter what also since now the eyepiece
is<00:02:21.810> built<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.379> housing<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.129> scope

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
is built into the housing of the scope

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.729 
is built into the housing of the scope
the<00:02:23.970> zoom<00:02:24.209> ring<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.450> no<00:02:24.690> longer<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.349> top<00:02:25.560> on

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the zoom ring is no longer up on top on

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.170 
the zoom ring is no longer up on top on
the<00:02:25.830> eyepiece<00:02:26.129> it's<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:26.790> next

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the eyepiece it's down here right next

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
the eyepiece it's down here right next
to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> focusing<00:02:27.900> ring<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> really

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
to the focusing ring so this is really

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
to the focusing ring so this is really
cool<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.550> you're<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> field<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> can

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
cool so when you're in the field you can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.900 
cool so when you're in the field you can
go<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:31.050> focusing<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.769> zooming<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.310> back<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
go from focusing to zooming and back to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.240 
go from focusing to zooming and back to
focusing<00:02:33.360> again<00:02:33.630> instantly<00:02:33.989> say<00:02:34.739> what<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.130> was

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
focusing again instantly say what it was

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.800 
focusing again instantly say what it was
it<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.670> tricky<00:02:35.910> learning<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.690> was

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it was tricky learning it because I was

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.089 
it was tricky learning it because I was
used<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.080> reaching<00:02:37.319> back<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> eyepiece

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
used to reaching back up to the eyepiece

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.979 
used to reaching back up to the eyepiece
but<00:02:38.430> boy<00:02:38.580> once<00:02:38.849> once<00:02:39.090> I've<00:02:39.239> played<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.870> this

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
but boy once once I've played with this

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.589 
but boy once once I've played with this
it's<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.980> intuitive<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.090> nice<00:02:42.269> thing<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it's really intuitive the nice thing is

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's really intuitive the nice thing is
even<00:02:42.629> if<00:02:42.900> you're<00:02:43.049> wearing<00:02:43.230> gloves<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
even if you're wearing gloves in the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.680 
even if you're wearing gloves in the
middle<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.220> winter<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.299> stiffer

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
middle of winter it's a little stiffer

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.839 
middle of winter it's a little stiffer
focusing<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.620> stiffer<00:02:46.980> turning<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> zoom

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
focusing of stiffer turning the zoom

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.250 
focusing of stiffer turning the zoom
ring<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.480> turning<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> focus<00:02:48.989> ring

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
ring that it is turning the focus ring

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.930 
ring that it is turning the focus ring
so<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.470> can<00:02:49.560> tell<00:02:49.769> just<00:02:49.950> by<00:02:49.980> touching<00:02:50.280> which

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
so you can tell just by touching which

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.520 
so you can tell just by touching which
ring<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.329> have<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.380> worry

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
ring you have more on so we don't worry

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.229 
ring you have more on so we don't worry
about<00:02:52.680> being<00:02:52.890> confused<00:02:53.370> as<00:02:53.579> far<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:53.910> grabbing

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
about being confused as far as grabbing

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.210 
about being confused as far as grabbing
the<00:02:54.329> focus<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:54.810> grabbing<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.260> nope<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.950> zoom

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the focus or grabbing the nope the zoom

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.330 
the focus or grabbing the nope the zoom
here<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.819> sounds<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.120> by<00:02:58.190> building<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
here so it sounds like by building the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.920 
here so it sounds like by building the
zoom<00:02:59.579> eyepiece<00:02:59.970> into<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.329> scope<00:03:00.540> body<00:03:00.780> there

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
zoom eyepiece into the scope body there

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.990 
zoom eyepiece into the scope body there
are<00:03:00.989> some<00:03:01.170> real<00:03:01.440> practical<00:03:01.920> design<00:03:02.459> benefits

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
are some real practical design benefits

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.520 
are some real practical design benefits
both<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.569> kind<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:03.930> user-friendly

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
both and kind of this user-friendly

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.550 
both and kind of this user-friendly
feature<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> eye<00:03:05.250> relief<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.060> also

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
feature this with the eye relief it also

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.589 
feature this with the eye relief it also
optically<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.760> open<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.090> some<00:03:09.299> doors<00:03:09.480> for

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
optically really open up some doors for

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.420 
optically really open up some doors for
you<00:03:09.810> guys<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.440> really<00:03:10.739> cool<00:03:10.769> thing<00:03:10.980> was

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you guys and the really cool thing was

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.030 
you guys and the really cool thing was
we<00:03:11.760> integrated<00:03:12.360> swaro<00:03:13.110> vision<00:03:13.470> technology

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
we integrated swaro vision technology

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.250 
we integrated swaro vision technology
from<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.310> binoculars<00:03:14.910> which<00:03:15.480> was<00:03:15.690> not<00:03:16.230> only

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
from the binoculars which was not only

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.110 
from the binoculars which was not only
high-definition<00:03:17.130> lenses<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.700> wide<00:03:17.850> field

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
high-definition lenses and wide field

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.670 
high-definition lenses and wide field
the<00:03:18.299> long<00:03:18.450> eye<00:03:18.600> relief<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.019> also<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.440> field

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the long eye relief but also the field

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
the long eye relief but also the field
flatteners<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.730> swirl<00:03:21.000> vision<00:03:21.389> field

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
flatteners the swirl vision field

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.970 
flatteners the swirl vision field
flattener<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.319> too<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.829> we<00:03:22.950> have

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
flattener in here too now so we have

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
flattener in here too now so we have
perfect<00:03:23.609> sharpness<00:03:24.090> right<00:03:24.420> out<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.840> edge

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
perfect sharpness right out to the edge

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.080 
perfect sharpness right out to the edge
of<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.260> scope<00:03:25.560> makes<00:03:26.220> for<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.940> most

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
of the scope makes for just the most

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.610 
of the scope makes for just the most
incredible<00:03:27.209> view<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.900> ever<00:03:28.019> seen<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.290> mean<00:03:28.410> I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
incredible view of ever seen I mean I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.590 
incredible view of ever seen I mean I
was<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.950> was<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.850> having<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.329> much<00:03:30.420> fun

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
was I was just so having so much fun

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.759 
was I was just so having so much fun
with<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.810> bunting<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.260> wasn't<00:03:31.440> even<00:03:31.560> funny

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
with that bunting it wasn't even funny

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.009 
with that bunting it wasn't even funny
so<00:03:32.400> what<00:03:32.549> makes<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.000> modular<00:03:33.569> spotting

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
so what makes this a modular spotting

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.500 
so what makes this a modular spotting
scope<00:03:34.290> okay<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.700> last<00:03:35.940> kind<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
scope okay that was the last kind of a

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.180 
scope okay that was the last kind of a
little<00:03:36.810> gift<00:03:37.079> that<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> engineers

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
little gift that the that the engineers

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.390 
little gift that the that the engineers
did<00:03:38.370> for<00:03:38.609> us<00:03:38.760> push<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> button<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:40.019> here

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
did for us push the button right here

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.050 
did for us push the button right here
turn<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.510> pop<00:03:43.260> off<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:44.060> Popular's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
turn and you can pop off your Popular's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.840 
turn and you can pop off your Popular's
so<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:45.900> your<00:03:46.380> ocular<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.160> your<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.790> your

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
so now your ocular and your and your

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.210 
so now your ocular and your and your
objective<00:03:48.329> lenses<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:48.900> separate<00:03:49.380> cool

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
objective lenses are now separate cool

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.009 
objective lenses are now separate cool
thing<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.970> don't<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.870> necessarily

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
thing is you don't have to necessarily

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.809 
thing is you don't have to necessarily
have<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.709> scope<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.280> brought<00:03:53.609> with

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
have one scope with you I brought with

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.440 
have one scope with you I brought with
me<00:03:53.880> out<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.299> field<00:03:54.480> well<00:03:54.780> my<00:03:55.260> little<00:03:55.440> 65

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
me out in the field well my little 65

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.180 
me out in the field well my little 65
the<00:03:57.450> reason<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> 65<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.889> know<00:03:59.040> me

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
the reason I do the 65 is you know me

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.759 
the reason I do the 65 is you know me
I'm<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> butterfly<00:03:59.819> guy<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.109> 65

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
I'm the butterfly guy with a 65

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.129 
I'm the butterfly guy with a 65
millimeter<00:04:02.250> scope<00:04:02.579> we<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.359> minimum<00:04:03.780> focus

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
millimeter scope we have a minimum focus

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.979 
millimeter scope we have a minimum focus
of<00:04:04.290> seven<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.739> half<00:04:04.799> feet<00:04:05.130> at<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.269> full<00:04:06.599> sixty

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
of seven and a half feet at a full sixty

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.020 
of seven and a half feet at a full sixty
power<00:04:07.200> because<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.859> still<00:04:08.040> 25<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.700> 60

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
power because this is still 25 to 60

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.670 
power because this is still 25 to 60
power<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> zooming<00:04:10.139> comes<00:04:10.380> with<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
power because the zooming comes with the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.099 
power because the zooming comes with the
eyepiece<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:11.370> not<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> ocular<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.079> I

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
eyepiece and not with the ocular so I

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.039 
eyepiece and not with the ocular so I
can<00:04:13.349> do<00:04:13.470> literally<00:04:14.280> macro<00:04:15.150> shots<00:04:15.419> head<00:04:15.720> shots

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
can do literally macro shots head shots

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.870 
can do literally macro shots head shots
of<00:04:16.229> dragonflies<00:04:16.650> butterflies<00:04:17.340> stuff<00:04:17.669> like

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
of dragonflies butterflies stuff like

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.150 
of dragonflies butterflies stuff like
that<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:18.930> if<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.410> want<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> get<00:04:19.769> back<00:04:19.950> to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
that with this if I want to get back to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.430 
that with this if I want to get back to
more<00:04:20.910> long<00:04:21.150> distance<00:04:21.329> viewing<00:04:21.659> or<00:04:21.989> better

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
more long distance viewing or better

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.930 
more long distance viewing or better
light<00:04:22.710> gathering<00:04:23.159> I<00:04:23.250> can<00:04:23.430> just<00:04:23.580> pop<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.909> back

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
light gathering I can just pop it back

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.559 
light gathering I can just pop it back
on<00:04:24.090> to

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
on to

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:30.670 
on to
yeah<00:04:26.569> there<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:26.990> go<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.129> 85<00:04:29.379> so<00:04:30.379> this<00:04:30.560> so

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
yeah there you go on the 85 so this so

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.499 
yeah there you go on the 85 so this so
this<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.979> more<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.400> isn't<00:04:31.729> just<00:04:31.970> an<00:04:32.090> eyepiece

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
this is more this isn't just an eyepiece

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.059 
this is more this isn't just an eyepiece
like<00:04:32.720> we've<00:04:32.870> seen<00:04:33.080> these<00:04:33.289> traditional<00:04:33.800> scopes

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
like we've seen these traditional scopes

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.339 
like we've seen these traditional scopes
this<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.789> eyepiece<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.810> got<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.080> focus

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
this is the eyepiece it's got the focus

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.219 
this is the eyepiece it's got the focus
ring<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:37.129> the<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.639> zoom<00:04:37.909> ring<00:04:38.419> built<00:04:38.780> into<00:04:39.110> it

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
ring are the the zoom ring built into it

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.110 
ring are the the zoom ring built into it
the<00:04:39.259> prism<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.800> there<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.729> a<00:04:40.879> pretty

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
the prism in there so this is a pretty

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.610 
the prism in there so this is a pretty
substantial<00:04:41.330> part<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.289> whole<00:04:42.409> system

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
substantial part of the whole system

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.619 
substantial part of the whole system
here<00:04:42.889> not<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.550> eyepieces<00:04:43.940> essentially

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
here not just the eyepieces essentially

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.300 
here not just the eyepieces essentially
you've<00:04:45.289> got<00:04:45.470> these<00:04:45.590> front<00:04:45.889> lenses<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.280> can

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
you've got these front lenses you can

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.159 
you've got these front lenses you can
swap<00:04:46.610> up<00:04:46.789> right<00:04:47.060> exactly<00:04:47.569> so<00:04:47.659> now<00:04:47.810> depending

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
swap up right exactly so now depending

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.680 
swap up right exactly so now depending
on<00:04:48.500> what<00:04:48.620> your<00:04:48.770> what<00:04:49.009> your<00:04:49.129> needs<00:04:49.370> are<00:04:49.690> you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
on what your what your needs are you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.029 
on what your what your needs are you
want<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.870> go<00:04:50.990> out<00:04:51.110> birding<00:04:51.379> like<00:04:51.500> today<00:04:51.770> today

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
want to go out birding like today today

want to go out birding like today today
bring<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.669> 85<00:04:53.030> millimeter<00:04:53.419> we<00:04:53.539> do<00:04:53.690> have<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.900> 95

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
bring the 85 millimeter we do have a 95

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.260 
bring the 85 millimeter we do have a 95
millimeter<00:04:54.800> scope<00:04:55.099> even<00:04:55.430> bigger<00:04:55.639> brighter

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
millimeter scope even bigger brighter

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.360 
millimeter scope even bigger brighter
more<00:04:56.690> sharpness<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.409> didn't<00:04:57.860> bring<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.130> with<00:04:58.159> me

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
more sharpness I didn't bring it with me

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.189 
more sharpness I didn't bring it with me
today<00:04:58.490> but<00:04:58.819> that's<00:04:58.970> another<00:04:59.270> module<00:04:59.479> another

low-light<00:05:30.860> viewing<00:05:31.219> and<00:05:31.370> then<00:05:31.969> maybe<00:05:32.210> if<00:05:32.389> they

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
low-light viewing and then maybe if they

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.320 
low-light viewing and then maybe if they
want<00:05:32.659> to<00:05:32.719> go<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.020> trip<00:05:33.229> take<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.190> take<00:05:34.729> 65

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
want to go on a trip take the take 65

want to go on a trip take the take 65
with<00:05:35.539> them<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:35.930> everything<00:05:36.530> packs<00:05:36.860> nicely<00:05:37.280> to

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
with them and everything packs nicely to

with them and everything packs nicely to
Costa<00:05:37.699> Rica<00:05:38.590> so<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.740> seems<00:05:39.919> like<00:05:39.979> really<00:05:40.520> kind

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
Costa Rica so it seems like really kind

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.939 
Costa Rica so it seems like really kind
of<00:05:40.849> an<00:05:41.120> unprecedented<00:05:41.840> degree<00:05:42.680> of

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
of an unprecedented degree of

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.379 
of an unprecedented degree of
versatility<00:05:43.370> here<00:05:43.669> with<00:05:43.849> this<00:05:43.940> set<00:05:44.180> up<00:05:44.270> by

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
versatility here with this set up by

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.390 
versatility here with this set up by
separating<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.990> objective<00:05:45.440> lens<00:05:45.680> from<00:05:46.340> the

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
separating the objective lens from the

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.100 
separating the objective lens from the
ocular<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:46.969> I<00:05:47.029> imagine<00:05:47.419> we<00:05:47.509> could<00:05:47.630> also<00:05:47.750> put

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
ocular and I imagine we could also put

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.260 
ocular and I imagine we could also put
let's<00:05:48.979> say<00:05:49.159> we<00:05:49.430> instead<00:05:49.909> of<00:05:50.000> going<00:05:50.180> from

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
let's say we instead of going from

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.730 
let's say we instead of going from
bigger<00:05:50.539> to<00:05:50.690> smaller<00:05:50.719> scopes<00:05:51.259> want<00:05:51.440> to<00:05:51.500> go<00:05:51.590> from

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
bigger to smaller scopes want to go from

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800 
bigger to smaller scopes want to go from
a<00:05:51.800> straight<00:05:52.039> to<00:05:52.159> an<00:05:52.250> angled<00:05:52.520> scope<00:05:52.789> instead<00:05:53.750> of

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
a straight to an angled scope instead of

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.149 
a straight to an angled scope instead of
having<00:05:53.930> to<00:05:54.020> buy<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.139> whole<00:05:54.380> new<00:05:54.409> scope<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:55.039> can

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
having to buy a whole new scope you can

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.980 
having to buy a whole new scope you can
just<00:05:55.279> buy<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.460> owned<00:05:55.669> by<00:05:56.000> another<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.539> bit<00:05:56.810> by

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
just buy is owned by another a bit by

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.959 
just buy is owned by another a bit by
another<00:05:57.199> ocular<00:05:57.620> yeah<00:05:57.770> exactly<00:05:57.979> and<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.849> get

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
another ocular yeah exactly and you get

because<00:06:05.779> it<00:06:05.960> tracks<00:06:06.199> a<00:06:06.319> little<00:06:06.380> better<00:06:06.650> with

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
because it tracks a little better with

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.769 
because it tracks a little better with
the<00:06:06.860> camera<00:06:07.219> on<00:06:07.279> there<00:06:07.490> otherwise<00:06:08.150> when<00:06:08.599> I<00:06:08.630> do

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
the camera on there otherwise when I do

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.749 
the camera on there otherwise when I do
it<00:06:08.840> leading<00:06:09.080> a<00:06:09.139> bird<00:06:09.319> walk<00:06:09.529> the<00:06:10.430> angle

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
it leading a bird walk the angle

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.950 
it leading a bird walk the angle
eyepiece<00:06:11.090> is<00:06:11.270> better<00:06:11.449> because<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.779> scope

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
eyepiece is better because the scope

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.689 
eyepiece is better because the scope
will<00:06:12.169> be<00:06:12.259> down<00:06:12.409> lower<00:06:12.620> yeah<00:06:12.949> this<00:06:13.250> is<00:06:13.400> this<00:06:13.520> is
