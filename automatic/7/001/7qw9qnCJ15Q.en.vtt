only<00:03:20.750> supposed<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.019> get<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.170> clearer<00:03:21.819> sense<00:03:22.819> of

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
only supposed to get a clearer sense of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.089 
only supposed to get a clearer sense of
the<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.930> reason<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.200> have<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.500> charcoal<00:03:24.920> and

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
the the reason we have the charcoal and

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.470 
the the reason we have the charcoal and
because<00:03:25.400> it's<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.849> girls<00:03:26.180> help<00:03:26.390> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
because it's the girls help the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.380 
because it's the girls help the
impurities<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.319> magnet<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.280> yes<00:03:28.549> my<00:03:29.150> skin

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
impurities like a magnet so yes my skin

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.270 
impurities like a magnet so yes my skin
has<00:03:29.510> been<00:03:29.540> feeling<00:03:29.959> like<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.469> cleaner

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
has been feeling like it's cleaner

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.869 
has been feeling like it's cleaner
deep<00:03:31.760> down<00:03:31.969> so<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.319> really<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.709> very<00:03:34.129> um

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
deep down so this is really a very um

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.300 
deep down so this is really a very um
you<00:03:35.810> should<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.049> consistency<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.250> is

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you should have consistency of it it is

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.629 
you should have consistency of it it is
almost<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:38.659> like<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.319> other<00:03:39.439> time<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.519> it's
