00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
tunnel from tunnel 9 now this is really

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
tunnel from tunnel 9 now this is really
going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> lot<00:01:23.700> battery

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
because at first you know air sweepers
were<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.580> useless<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.630> only

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
were kind of useless because they only

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
were kind of useless because they only
faced<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> attack<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
faced one way and if you attack with a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.120 
faced one way and if you attack with a
troops<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.600> side<00:01:30.950> like<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
troops from the other side like you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
troops from the other side like you
could<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.700> easily<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.570> take<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
could just really easily like take on

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
could just really easily like take on
the<00:01:34.110> base<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> from

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the base like you can just go in from

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.330 
the base like you can just go in from
one<00:01:35.880> side<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> now

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
one side and that's it you know and now

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
one side and that's it you know and now
that<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.270> add<00:01:39.450> sweepers<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that they have to add sweepers is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.539 
that they have to add sweepers is
actually<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.490> more

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
actually going to be a lot more

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.480 
actually going to be a lot more
difficult<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> attacker<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
difficult for the attacker and the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
difficult for the attacker and the

out<00:01:47.310> base<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
out base a little bit better because it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.880 
out base a little bit better because it
was<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> make<00:01:49.860> a
