with the four colors it just really

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.809 
with the four colors it just really
works<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.829> translucent<00:03:40.609> powder

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
works is like a translucent powder

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.849 
works is like a translucent powder
you're<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.389> going<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.630> see<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.049> but<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.769> gives

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
you're not going to see it but it gives

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.199 
you're not going to see it but it gives
you<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.099> little<00:03:43.310> more<00:03:43.430> coverage<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.090> just
