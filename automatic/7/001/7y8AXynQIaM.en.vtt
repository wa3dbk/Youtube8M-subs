00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
don't see things exactly as you do it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.890 
don't see things exactly as you do it
doesn't<00:02:12.160> make<00:02:12.310> them<00:02:12.460> wrong<00:02:12.760> okay<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.540> just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
doesn't make them wrong okay so just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.230 
doesn't make them wrong okay so just
remember<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.410> but<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.770> think<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.340> guys<00:02:15.550> like

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
remember that but I think you guys like

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.630 
remember that but I think you guys like
I<00:02:16.360> said<00:02:16.510> you're<00:02:16.630> kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.110> plugged<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.640> this

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
I said you're kind of plugged in this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.250 
I said you're kind of plugged in this
month<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.480> least<00:02:19.630> enough<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:19.990> let

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
month like at least enough to let

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.760 
month like at least enough to let
abundance<00:02:20.710> flow<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> think<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.960> this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
abundance flow in so I think it this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.320 
abundance flow in so I think it this
might<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.220> thing<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> triggers<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.090> it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
might be the thing that triggers it it

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.200 
might be the thing that triggers it it
might<00:02:25.690> be<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.990> realization<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.880> when<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
might be this realization that when you

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.360 
might be this realization that when you
come<00:02:28.360> from<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.600> place<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.930> compassion<00:02:29.410> when<00:02:30.220> you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
come from a place of compassion when you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.040 
come from a place of compassion when you
get<00:02:30.580> your<00:02:30.610> energy<00:02:31.150> into<00:02:31.270> alignment<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
get your energy into alignment like I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.320
