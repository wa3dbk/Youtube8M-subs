00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.320
 Y 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.930
 well the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.990
 connect our tablet to our 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.510
 computer using the usb cable and 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.700
 we have to install the drivers in my 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.220
 I already have the drivers installed 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.020
 to save time the insurance the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 Second step is to download Android SDK 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.080
 for this we go to the official website 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.540
 from android and I'll leave the link in 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.140
 the description of the video and we click on it 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.300
 in download 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.610
 will open this little window where we have 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.409
 that palomear here where it says that 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.700
 We want to accept the terms and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.320
 conditions abajito we select 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.940
 our operating system and if it's 32 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.940
 vice or 64 bytes 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.229
 in my case from 32 and I put you download 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 we wait and start downloading the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 file as I already have it downloaded 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 Well, he canceled it, it does not take long and good 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.330
 depending on the internet since what 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 download we extract it and it's going to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.560
 generate a folder that contains all 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560
 these files 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.260
 the next thing is to open that of each 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.530
 manager to be able to install 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.380
 google usb distribute packages then 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.970
 As I have it installed, here is not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.180
 gives me the option to install but 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.860
 you will give them choice and as it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.830
 put install because this is then 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.830
 They wait for me to load the bar and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.560
 will install so they can use the sdk and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.240
 so you can unlock your tablet to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.860
 make sure that our tablet is 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.450
 connected we go to the tools folder 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.830
 and we give him from ms to open this 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.960
 file as it is not an executable 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.570
 we have to have java installed for 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.120
 that our computer can open that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.940
 archive 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 we double click and it will open a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.720
 screen similar to rather it is equal 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 to cmd 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.260
 but it will execute some commands and we 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.910
 will open this screen in this window what 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.420
 what comes out is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.400
 our tablet or our cell phone either 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.860
 in the case of you 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.989
 and in my case it is online, it means 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.860
 which is active if in your case it would be 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.500
 online offline sorry they disconnect you and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 they reconnect it until they are 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 give online to know what is connected 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.689
 there we already know but if we want to know 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.790
 we give it with a single click and it's going to 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.459
 listen to these commands and we give in 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.850
 device screen capture and it will show us 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.000
 the home screen of our tablet 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.810
 in my case, the tablet just 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.980
 unlock a few minutes ago and only 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.069
 I'm doing this video tutorial for 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.010
 tell them more or less how I did it 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.270
 ok we close those and we're going towards 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.660
 back to the folder that says platform 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.280
 in here is how important we have 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.340
 have to open a command window to 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.790
 we give the shift key and without 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.190
 drop we right click on our 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.730
 mouse and we open the window 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.390
 commands 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.299
 well we will open a cmd in which 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.989
 we have to put several commands 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.989
 the first is 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.220
 advice is to check that in this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.190
 tablet has not been disconnected and the 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.430
 we have active the following command is 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.430
 the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.500
 dv 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:29.540
 which is to be able to enter 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.450
 to the tablet using commands now as 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.980
 we see sends us a symbol of weight but 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.210
 there we are not like super users 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.100
 then we can not use some 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.670
 commands to enter as superuser 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.340
 is its the same as in linux many of 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.790
 you will know how to use lines and now yes 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.040
 We are like super users for it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.510
 we will have to use two commands plus the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.240
 command that follows is the most important 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.240
 what is the white data this command 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.570
 is the one that is going to make our tablet 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.669
 or cell phone laughs without asking from the 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.840
 screen that we move some buttons 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.000
 as in some case is we prescribe the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.460
 tablet starts as 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.470
 as user use and we have to move 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.390
 the volume and power buttons on my 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.520
 case this tablet for something does not have 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.980
 buttons only has the power button 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.650
 that's why I'm turning to this 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.889
 method 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:33.070
 to unlock it with this 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.070
 web data command remains factory 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.120
 so that it works then we give it 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.830
 enter in my case like I just 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.080
 reset it is not necessary but 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.590
 you yes and give that command now 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.590
 if they put 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.650
 the reboot that this is here makes it 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.510
 restart our tablet so you can 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.620
 learn normally it will take like 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.199
 some 21 minutes while it 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.950
 accommodates everything as it did not have right since 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.040
 give him enter 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.530
 That would be all 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.410
 well this is all I hope that you 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.720
 I liked the video tutorial in case 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.140
 that it will not work or that it will not work 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.990
 know how to do it again 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.750
 send me an email or a message 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.430
 facebook that I will leave me in the ces 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.670
 in the description of the video and I hope they 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.670
 I liked it
