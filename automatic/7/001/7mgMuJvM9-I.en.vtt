00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
way or the other so my pick is 12 years

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
way or the other so my pick is 12 years
a<00:00:44.579> slave<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> wouldn't<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.539> surprised<00:00:46.079> if

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
a slave but I wouldn't be surprised if

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
gravity takes it what about Best Actor
in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> Drama<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> be

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
in a Drama I think that's going to be

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
in a Drama I think that's going to be
chua<00:00:50.550> tellegio<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> star<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> 12<00:00:52.260> years<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
