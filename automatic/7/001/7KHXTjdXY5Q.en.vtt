00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
favourite weapons because of the fire

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.210 
favourite weapons because of the fire
rate<00:00:45.140> i<00:00:45.200> prefer<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.560> have<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.800> gun<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.070> has<00:00:46.160> a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
rate i prefer to have a gun that has a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.010 
rate i prefer to have a gun that has a
faster<00:00:46.640> fire<00:00:46.850> rate<00:00:46.880> but<00:00:47.210> i<00:00:47.510> could<00:00:47.660> see<00:00:47.780> why<00:00:47.960> as

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
faster fire rate but i could see why as

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.900 
faster fire rate but i could see why as
a<00:00:48.140> desirable<00:00:48.530> weapon<00:00:48.950> is<00:00:49.070> really<00:00:49.430> strong<00:00:49.640> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
a desirable weapon is really strong and

a desirable weapon is really strong and
it<00:00:49.970> holds<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:50.899> much<00:00:51.110> ammo<00:00:51.530> when<00:00:51.950> you<00:00:52.040> upgrade

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
it holds so much ammo when you upgrade

it holds so much ammo when you upgrade

it has a 50-round magazine in 600

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.049 
it has a 50-round magazine in 600
reserve<00:00:54.620> ammo<00:00:54.950> I<00:00:55.100> mean<00:00:55.460> that's<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.700> lot<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:55.880> am

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
reserve ammo I mean that's a lot of am

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.850 
reserve ammo I mean that's a lot of am
that's<00:00:56.300> rivaling<00:00:56.750> some<00:00:56.899> LMGs<00:00:57.380> so<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:57.829> a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's rivaling some LMGs so it's a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.319 
that's rivaling some LMGs so it's a
pretty<00:00:58.010> decent<00:00:58.219> weapon<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.790> especially<00:00:59.059> for

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
pretty decent weapon and especially for

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.459 
pretty decent weapon and especially for
a<00:00:59.360> wall<00:00:59.570> weapon<00:00:59.870> when<00:00:59.989> while<00:01:00.110> weapons<00:01:00.230> are

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
a wall weapon when while weapons are

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.569 
a wall weapon when while weapons are
generally<00:01:00.710> considered<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.100> be<00:01:01.250> lesser

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
generally considered to be lesser

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.369 
generally considered to be lesser
weapons<00:01:01.879> than<00:01:02.000> box<00:01:02.180> weapons<00:01:02.540> that's<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.140> fairly

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
weapons than box weapons that's a fairly

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.600 
weapons than box weapons that's a fairly
decent<00:01:03.620> weapon<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.100> can<00:01:04.219> see<00:01:04.399> why<00:01:04.549> this

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
decent weapon so I can see why this

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.490 
decent weapon so I can see why this
weapon<00:01:05.000> would<00:01:05.119> be<00:01:05.149> so<00:01:05.420> highly<00:01:05.750> acclaimed<00:01:05.930> and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
weapon would be so highly acclaimed and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.480 
weapon would be so highly acclaimed and
when<00:01:06.649> you<00:01:06.740> upgrade<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.130> actually<00:01:07.340> hit<00:01:07.399> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
when you upgrade you actually hit the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.770 
when you upgrade you actually hit the
reflex<00:01:07.880> sight<00:01:08.090> with<00:01:08.209> it<00:01:08.359> but<00:01:08.509> say<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:08.719> don't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
reflex sight with it but say you don't

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940 
reflex sight with it but say you don't
like<00:01:08.959> that<00:01:09.079> you<00:01:09.200> can<00:01:09.289> actually<00:01:09.350> pack<00:01:09.649> punch<00:01:09.859> it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
like that you can actually pack punch it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.199 
like that you can actually pack punch it
again<00:01:10.130> for<00:01:10.310> two<00:01:10.429> more<00:01:10.609> thousand<00:01:10.969> to<00:01:11.030> get<00:01:11.149> the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
much because i'm black ops 2 they did

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.169 
much because i'm black ops 2 they did
reduce<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.950> damage<00:01:43.279> but<00:01:43.459> increase<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.969> fire

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
reduce the damage but increase the fire

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.609 
reduce the damage but increase the fire
rate<00:01:44.389> which<00:01:44.509> kind<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:44.749> evens<00:01:45.079> it<00:01:45.200> out<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.349> little

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
rate which kind of evens it out a little

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.599 
rate which kind of evens it out a little
bit<00:01:45.740> depending<00:01:45.919> on<00:01:46.099> how<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:46.249> look<00:01:46.399> at<00:01:46.549> it

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
bit depending on how you look at it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.580 
bit depending on how you look at it
especially<00:01:47.359> if<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.509> get<00:01:47.599> DoubleTap<00:01:47.990> 2.0<00:01:48.439> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
especially if you get DoubleTap 2.0 that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.870 
especially if you get DoubleTap 2.0 that
kind<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.799> makes<00:01:48.979> up<00:01:49.130> for<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.340> reduced<00:01:49.639> damage

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
kind of makes up for the reduced damage

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.519 
kind of makes up for the reduced damage
they<00:01:50.419> kind<00:01:50.599> of<00:01:50.659> want<00:01:50.779> to<00:01:50.810> make<00:01:50.959> it<00:01:51.049> on<00:01:51.139> par<00:01:51.380> with

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:51.529 
they kind of want to make it on par with

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:52.419 
they kind of want to make it on par with
some<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:51.799> other<00:01:51.950> weapons<00:01:52.249> in<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> game

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
some of the other weapons in the game

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.800 
some of the other weapons in the game
that's<00:01:52.939> why<00:01:53.119> they<00:01:53.240> kind<00:01:53.419> of<00:01:53.450> reduce<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
that's why they kind of reduce the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.659 
that's why they kind of reduce the
damage<00:01:54.139> but<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> would<00:01:54.889> award<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.159> black<00:01:55.310> ops<00:01:55.520> 1

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:55.669 
damage but a would award a black ops 1

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:56.709 
damage but a would award a black ops 1
they<00:01:55.789> didn't<00:01:55.969> change<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.209> single<00:01:56.359> thing<00:01:56.599> they

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
they didn't change a single thing they

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.359 
they didn't change a single thing they
kept<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.929> gun<00:01:57.079> exactly<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.590> same<00:01:57.770> all<00:01:58.130> they

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
kept the gun exactly the same all they

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.709 
kept the gun exactly the same all they
do<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.549> kind<00:01:58.759> of<00:01:58.789> rescan<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.209> little<00:01:59.479> bit<00:01:59.569> make

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
do is kind of rescan a little bit make

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.120 
do is kind of rescan a little bit make
it<00:01:59.749> look<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.989> little<00:02:00.109> bit<00:02:00.289> different<00:02:00.649> but<00:02:00.979> other

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
it look a little bit different but other

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.499 
it look a little bit different but other
than<00:02:01.249> that<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.549> gun<00:02:01.700> behaves<00:02:01.999> exactly<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
than that the gun behaves exactly the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.239 
than that the gun behaves exactly the
same<00:02:02.779> it's<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.079> fairly<00:02:03.289> powerful<00:02:03.529> weapon<00:02:03.979> isn't

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249

monkey<00:02:25.830> or<00:02:25.920> something<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.520> taking

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
monkey or something so we're not taking

a<00:02:26.850> whole<00:02:27.000> tray<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.300> zombies<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.660> there<00:02:27.750> cuz

a whole tray of zombies in there cuz

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.390 
a whole tray of zombies in there cuz
that<00:02:27.990> would<00:02:28.110> probably<00:02:28.290> not<00:02:28.500> end<00:02:28.740> well<00:02:28.890> this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that would probably not end well this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.560 
that would probably not end well this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.110 
and will to warm black ops 1 the gun is
relatively<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.890> same<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> only<00:02:56.790> thing<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
relatively the same but the only thing I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.280 
relatively the same but the only thing I
really<00:02:57.390> hate<00:02:57.600> about<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.900> world<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.110> warm

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
black ops one version is the ammo when

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.940 
black ops one version is the ammo when
you<00:03:00.300> went<00:03:00.480> through<00:03:00.570> ammo<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.170> quick<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.830> where

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you went through ammo so quick to where

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.080 
you went through ammo so quick to where
it<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.340> wasn't<00:03:02.520> even<00:03:02.700> worth<00:03:02.850> buying

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it really just wasn't even worth buying

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.220 
it really just wasn't even worth buying
because<00:03:03.300> by<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.570> time<00:03:03.600> you're<00:03:03.930> done<00:03:04.020> shooting

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
because by the time you're done shooting

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.600 
because by the time you're done shooting
you<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:04.680> make<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> points<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.550> you

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
you really make up the points that you

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.340 
you really make up the points that you
would<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.820> already<00:03:06.150> lost<00:03:06.360> from<00:03:06.870> buying<00:03:07.050> ammo

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
would have already lost from buying ammo

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
would have already lost from buying ammo
off<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.560> wall<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:07.770> before<00:03:08.670> he<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.820> kind<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.000> a

what<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.430> recommend<00:03:29.880> buying<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.210> on<00:03:30.360> early

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
what I recommend buying this on early

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.090 
what I recommend buying this on early
rounds<00:03:30.900> yes<00:03:31.080> it's<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.320> fairly<00:03:31.650> decent<00:03:31.770> weapon

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
rounds yes it's a fairly decent weapon

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.710 
rounds yes it's a fairly decent weapon
it's<00:03:32.220> really<00:03:32.430> strong<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:33.120> always<00:03:33.390> helped<00:03:33.600> me

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it's really strong it's always helped me

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's really strong it's always helped me
out<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.350> what<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:34.860> consider<00:03:35.160> having<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
out but what I really consider having a

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.370 
out but what I really consider having a
far<00:03:35.790> round<00:03:35.970> probably<00:03:36.660> not<00:03:36.870> because<00:03:37.170> again

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
far round probably not because again

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.300 
far round probably not because again
this<00:03:37.470> weapon<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.710> doesn't<00:03:38.040> really<00:03:38.160> hold

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
this weapon just doesn't really hold

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.680 
this weapon just doesn't really hold
enough<00:03:38.520> ammo<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.210> really<00:03:39.390> don't<00:03:39.510> see<00:03:39.570> it's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
enough ammo so I really don't see it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.180 
enough ammo so I really don't see it's
worth<00:03:39.840> buying<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> later<00:03:40.590> rounds<00:03:40.800> but<00:03:41.070> on

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
worth buying on the later rounds but on

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.320 
worth buying on the later rounds but on
early<00:03:41.400> rounds<00:03:41.610> by<00:03:41.700> all<00:03:41.760> means<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.180> this

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
early rounds by all means get this

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.730 
early rounds by all means get this
weapon<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.020> strong<00:03:43.230> weapon<00:03:43.560> it's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
weapon it's a really strong weapon it's

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.720 
weapon it's a really strong weapon it's
gonna<00:03:43.890> help<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.130> out<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> ammo<00:03:44.670> is

prime<00:03:56.520> location<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.510> doable<00:03:57.840> yes<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.410> it's

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
prime location it is doable yes but it's

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.750 
prime location it is doable yes but it's
probably<00:03:58.709> not<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.070> best<00:03:59.190> location<00:03:59.340> unless

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
probably not in the best location unless

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
probably not in the best location unless
you're<00:03:59.910> gonna<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.060> hang<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.300> teleporter

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you're gonna be hang the teleporter

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.750 
you're gonna be hang the teleporter
directly<00:04:01.110> after<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> m240<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.580> really

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
directly after but the m240 is a really

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.190 
directly after but the m240 is a really
powerful<00:04:02.910> weapon<00:04:03.330> probably<00:04:03.840> one<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.050> best

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
powerful weapon probably one of the best

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.420 
powerful weapon probably one of the best
weapon<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.770> early<00:04:04.980> rounds<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.310> once

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
weapon to have on early rounds but once

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.320

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.280 
you really start to get up there you
might<00:04:06.450> wanna<00:04:06.570> consider<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.900> different<00:04:07.200> weapon

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
might wanna consider a different weapon

because<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.540> reminds<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.900> lot<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.080> people<00:04:25.260> of

because it reminds a lot of people of

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.050 
because it reminds a lot of people of
the<00:04:25.500> Thompson<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.100> ppsh<00:04:26.640> that's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
probably why a lot of people love it

probably why a lot of people love it
it<00:04:28.560> does<00:04:28.770> share<00:04:28.979> lots

it does share lots

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.710 
it does share lots
quality's<00:04:29.819> as<00:04:29.940> both<00:04:30.120> that's<00:04:30.330> what<00:04:30.449> a<00:04:30.479> lot<00:04:30.690> of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720

an but does not hold the most ammo out
of<00:04:32.190> all<00:04:32.280> weapons<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:32.910> does<00:04:33.090> hold<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> fairly

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
of all weapons but does hold a fairly

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.300 
of all weapons but does hold a fairly
decent<00:04:33.780> amount<00:04:34.139> even<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.710> magazine<00:04:35.130> and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
decent amount even in the magazine and

decent amount even in the magazine and
reserve<00:04:35.669> pants<00:04:35.970> reload<00:04:36.300> time<00:04:36.479> is<00:04:36.509> fairly

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
reserve pants reload time is fairly

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.600 
reserve pants reload time is fairly
quick<00:04:37.229> it<00:04:37.680> has<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.889> really<00:04:38.130> good<00:04:38.310> rate<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.490> fire

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
quick it has a really good rate of fire

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.890 
quick it has a really good rate of fire
doesn't<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> fastest<00:04:39.509> rate<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.750> fire

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
doesn't have the fastest rate of fire

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.120 
doesn't have the fastest rate of fire
but<00:04:39.930> I'd<00:04:40.169> probably<00:04:40.319> say<00:04:40.530> it's<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.770> top<00:04:40.949> end

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
but I'd probably say it's on the top end

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.800 
but I'd probably say it's on the top end
of<00:04:41.250> all<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.460> SMGs<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.300> only<00:04:42.449> thing<00:04:42.569> I<00:04:42.660> really

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
of all the SMGs the only thing I really

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.240 
of all the SMGs the only thing I really
don't<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.169> about<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.560> weapon<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:44.009> probably

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
don't like about this weapon is probably

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.740 
don't like about this weapon is probably
its<00:04:44.400> location<00:04:44.819> on<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.000> wall<00:04:45.180> it's<00:04:45.569> not<00:04:45.660> the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
its location on the wall it's not the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.450 
its location on the wall it's not the
most<00:04:45.870> ideal<00:04:46.020> location<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:46.800> getting<00:04:46.949> ammo<00:04:47.250> kind

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
most ideal location so getting ammo kind

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.920 
most ideal location so getting ammo kind
of<00:04:47.520> makes<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.789> pain<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.120> ass<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:48.750> if<00:04:48.840> you

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
of makes it a pain in the ass but if you

the<00:05:26.789> only<00:05:26.940> real<00:05:27.150> thing<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.509> dislike<00:05:27.780> about

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
the only real thing that I dislike about

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.300 
the only real thing that I dislike about
the<00:05:28.199> Thompson<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.650> doesn't<00:05:28.860> really<00:05:28.979> hold<00:05:29.159> that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the Thompson it doesn't really hold that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.920 
the Thompson it doesn't really hold that
much<00:05:29.639> ammo<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.060> does<00:05:30.150> hold<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.419> fairly<00:05:30.690> decent

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
much ammo it does hold a fairly decent

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.540 
much ammo it does hold a fairly decent
amount<00:05:31.380> that's<00:05:31.680> nowhere<00:05:32.009> near<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.340> amount

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
amount that's nowhere near the amount

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.680 
amount that's nowhere near the amount
that<00:05:32.580> some<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:32.880> weapons<00:05:33.150> in<00:05:33.210> black<00:05:33.360> ops<00:05:33.570> 2

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
that some of the weapons in black ops 2

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.180 
that some of the weapons in black ops 2
you<00:05:33.720> can<00:05:33.900> carry<00:05:34.110> but<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.740> doesn't<00:05:34.949> make<00:05:35.039> up<00:05:35.159> for

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
you can carry but it doesn't make up for

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
easy to get to and it's probably right

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.999

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
use and my experience that I've used

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:49.790 
use and my experience that I've used
this<00:05:48.750> weapon<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.199> always<00:05:49.380> get<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:49.650> your

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
this weapon and always get you your

this weapon and always get you your
money<00:05:49.949> back<00:05:50.099> so<00:05:50.340> when<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.520> buy<00:05:50.639> ammo<00:05:50.940> you're

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
money back so when you buy ammo you're

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.490 
money back so when you buy ammo you're
probably<00:05:51.270> gonna<00:05:51.449> get<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.690> exact<00:05:52.020> same<00:05:52.199> amount

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
probably gonna get the exact same amount
