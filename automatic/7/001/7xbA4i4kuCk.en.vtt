00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:11.599
 [Music] 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.449
 in recent times in Argentina 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.439
 They have reached a new style pickups 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.050
 we are used to what is 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.680
 call 1006 which is for example the reinier 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.119
 s 10 hi amarok lux however there is a 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.040
 new version of these vehicles 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 work derived from platforms of 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.649
 automobiles the case is that of the sloop 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 from volkswagen the mountain to be the engine 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.900
 derivative of chili 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.480
 and now it's the turn of a vehicle 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.300
 peugeot that is playing and playing was 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.970
 produced on the platform of 207 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.890
 made the trunk and the board has those 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.130
 characteristics but it is conceived as 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.260
 a work vehicle that offers is a 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.899
 vehicle that despite its size has 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.850
 almost 660 capable of kilos of cargo of 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.189
 ability plus what is very 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.040
 important is that it is a box of more than 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.259
 100 thousand 100 liters and that is designed 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 in such a way and conceived that a 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.610
 pallet full because because it has the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 Pass wheel tucked inside the box as 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.820
 is characteristic in many spades 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 what this application demands 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.770
 it's basically a cultural change 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.160
 obviously that for the field is not the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.260
 car more thought because there is yes where there 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.350
 very complicated terrain the pickup 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.040
 big looks but in transit 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.830
 urban for work more than 660 kilos 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.970
 load 1100 liters capacity a 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.440
 gasoline engine 1.6 106 horses that the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.980
 vehicle will really take into account 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.070
 fits into this fashion of pickups 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.020
 lightweight car derivatives and that 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.390
 for its price you have to have it very 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.640
 account as soon as we get on this 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.040
 auto there are three versions the least 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.530
 equipped has an initial value of one 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.890
 little bit more than 70 thousand pesos that arrives 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.229
 to almost 80 that is super full and that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 well you already have many elements of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.930
 comfort but I leave home derived from 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.730
 207 a work vehicle a vehicle 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.709
 Robust with a large load capacity 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.540
 a very accessible price and a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.300
 maintenance very also very accessible 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.780
 you need to change your head in Brazil- 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.120
 those cars are super 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.100
 if you have to work in the city and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.319
 you have to carry things if you do not need 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.390
 to walk on earth or by roads 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.790
 sacred and if also the weekend 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.830
 you want to take advantage to go for a walk in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.490
 a canchero car is a good proposal 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.490
 provident 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:50.789
