00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 with superman stock and you can 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.390
 imagine how I exulted when I found out 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 that General Zod will be in it and guess 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 who was not in it to General Zod 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.329
 who was not offered to play instead 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 director we keep masculine fit like that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.489
 that half the cars in this movie are like 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 on the male part of the powers it all 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.809
 natural plant 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.789
 this lost me dima swifts 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.369
 my perfection film actor looks 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.830
 how so trying to become a monk because of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.470
 this i decided 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 sabotage the fillets you heard right 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 sabotage that's why i assure you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.810
 that this will be one of the worst films about 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.830
 superman what ever were 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 and number 34 is worse I am not a magician but still 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 it's really bad for example i 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 broke her wrist and every opera pipe 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.470
 In this film, I guarantee that in this 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 there will be no normal movie 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.030
 I also use parkinson 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 my pulling power choose little hands from 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.850
 comments I managed to completely suck 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 acting skills of all the actors by them 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 addresses tastelessly tasteless and sukra 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 kevin costner 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 you know that I could not do anything 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.909
 do besides I caught up with the editor 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.049
 the movie 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.330
 used incredible muscle because 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.430
 adele like hill 2 for from cool and protected 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.670
 ask I managed to beat him so 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.049
 that he has short-term memory loss 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 because of this he completely forgot what 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.500
 okay he edited in the movie 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360
 when superman lands on the ground 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.620
 suddenly becomes fishermen every time 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 when he tries to talk to Lois Lane 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.400
 suddenly becomes a 12 year old and every time 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.440
 when the movie tries to develop characters 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.500
 scene of a chicken fall buses attack 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.790
 better woman seeing it will download so 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.620
 much you will have more 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.970
 emotionally sex and submissive in addition 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.450
 I did not look with my laser eyes 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.430
 the film's screenwriter thereby forcing them 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.890
 instead of creating a likeness of batman start and 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.850
 dark knight 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.380
 who do nothing more than 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.769
 create bring therefore the beginning of the dark 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.090
 knight 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.950
 I remember that happened 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.239
 screenwriter alone at home in this way 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.590
 the film makes only an attempt to tell 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.590
 the story of the word batman 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.390
 only more insidious every time 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 when the writers finished the scene I 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.180
 deleted them memories did you notice that 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.019
 talk about how to be a superman 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 the only one that repeats the whole 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.470
 this is because they have forgotten that wrote the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.180
 millions of times here is another example of that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.980
 what happened at the very end and by the way 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.959
 spoilers I had to do so where 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 superman attributes to the false in my forehead and 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.829
 false in favor of their laser eyes for 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.359
 killing a couple of people this is how it created 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.980
 people then naturally not all ran away 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.959
 Do not on all fours fours out of 5 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.970
 ways to develop this and superman charm 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.470
 he does nâ€™t care about his neck 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.600
 I have no Islam is two beauties 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.180
 superman screams anger for taking 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.310
 someone else's life in another movie this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.290
 man that is obvious and would have remained since years 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.390
 until the end of life gram of salt go there in 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
 the next scene so sure it will be 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 never was because in mind 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.019
 screenwriter this never happened 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.760
 what are you handsome bestar volley of course 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.609

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.680
 kisses from superman 2 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.180
 let's just leave it at that and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.849

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.170

 for many of you the movie was huge 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.170
 a failure and some believe that these 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.300
 changes made it better that very 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.650
 encouraging me it demonstrates that 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.200
 your planet of christ will be easier
