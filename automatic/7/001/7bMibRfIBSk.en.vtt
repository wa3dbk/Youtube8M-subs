00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 arrive the incoming look and write well e 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.839
 today we will see an important program that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 I made the MD that would be a meditates of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.160
 a ramdisk that in practice creates us a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.189
 disk using the RAM memory of the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 computer for example in this case is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 used 4GB of RAM 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.290
 let's start and see some of it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 settings there is the free version e 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 is that payment that costs 19 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.670
 dollars 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.469
 let's see various versions 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 here they are como 23 then there are oh well 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.100
 download 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 here it is free download for 4 gb for 6 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.170
 city of ram for the 64 that only to 19 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.360
 dollars 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 no I have downloaded the free version a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.260
 stop ramdisk for a moment is 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.549
 I've actually seen several 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.159
 benchmark and I've tried too 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.420
 personally we say that it increases the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.000
 performance around 1703 percent now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.689
 they are really big numbers though 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.580
 with 4 GB of non-storage available 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.000
 is that we can install who knows what 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 thing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 whatever we set the fact 32 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.780
 memory and we can 4 that not always 4 but 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 how are we going to see now I am about 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.159
 3.99 or otherwise 3.90 here you will need 98 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 obviously opening it empty and if we do 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.740
 a test for example 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.390
 we open something to download something 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.330
 which weighs a few megs 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:56.780
 for example here is that ios is 6.1 the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:00.880
 my phone and let's transfer it here 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 obviously also my hard disk will have 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.770
 its speed 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.390
 let's move for a moment anyway 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.570
 this is the speed that bends the hard 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.810
 disk for example if we pretend 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.680
 that this is almost the hard disk for example 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.709
 we create a new folder by doing meat 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.220
 pretend for example that there are files and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.900
 if we, for example, copy this and that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.459
 we paste here 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.180
 let's see the speed is 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.330
 it is practically immediate there is not there 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.790
 not even the loading of the florence that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.269
 tells you how much time is needed for 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.780
 transfer etcetera to pass 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.760
 two more files 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.580
 but this, however, is the speed of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.130
 reading of the writing artists of 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.610
 let's say this virtual software 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.310
 of our ram 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.850
 let's try to copy all this here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 inside 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.100
 replacing this does not even ask us 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.380
 that is, it does not even show us how much 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.500
 time therefore necessarily takes for 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.200
 example if you have any program 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.120
 which weighs 4 gb 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.790
 the recession the reggina did not me 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.230
 interested so I said if you want 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.900
 install for example some program 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.290
 however it is any game now it seems to me 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.590
 difficult that 4gb weights install it here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.560
 because it will be much faster than 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.049
 a hard disk is in fact like a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.489
 ssd only is even faster 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:41.390
 compared to other benchmarks and also to 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.160
 other reviews or we have for example 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.160
 allows to speed up all the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.530
 reading operations up to 1700 per 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.590
 one hundred video game update e 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.180
 we have a maximum of 25.6 gigabytes per 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.010
 so second is not that it is 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.950
 it's a very long number I have it 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.900
 tried there past file as it is 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.519
 much more reactive I tried though 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.030
 launches the program I now have 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.549
 uninstalled and let's say it's the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.859
 program that all its projections is 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.320
 very fast and very responsive 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.180
 obviously it uses the ram memory that 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.769
 we have available in this case 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.449
 I 8 GB of ram 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:30.039
 therefore a disk of 4,092 megs will be created 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.289
 I advise you to download it because if 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.050
 you want to have a high program 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.660
 performance you put it in this 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.740
 virtual external key and makes its own 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.780
 for you 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.310
 by derrick tm the forum must write e 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.310
 everything and look for the next one
