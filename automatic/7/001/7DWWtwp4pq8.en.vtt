00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.920
 here we have the nature amaral halo 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.259
 led flashing ring light that we have 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.379
 in our shop for the camera nikon 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.630
 system I have graces you see the 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.840
 could clearly see him 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.460
 demonstrated and the whole set like that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.599
 is established that entails all the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 Come on, it 's just in here 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.310
 film this video 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.779
 the first thing that stands out about this construction 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.160
 that is not quite right 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.509
 So I have this we are happy 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.100
 adapter in gear or better 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.970
 is attached but I thought I start 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.579
 from the back 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.110
 we have probably here on the on the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.780
 control unit once again 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.160
 possibility the light also up here 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.210
 on back that is from any 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.350
 They just want to start a business 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.610
 example now has just this ring 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.140
 would like or this lightning is what 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.120
 actually use out of the shackles 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.850
 Best one just in the form of 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 a radio trigger and that means that 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.789
 whole is then on a tripod 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.070
 the optional accessory fastens into 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.510
 The recipient here and there they can 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.710
 then just up this part 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.870
 Open up and do this on a tripod 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.370
 attach and then lift them up 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.900
 use control power that has him as 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 external lightning that one at each 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.549
 situation so that no one thinks 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.960
 started and usually heard 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.060
 this light has it on the front just 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.650
 this wrestling is ahead and that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.509
 are just just a lot of scope 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.790
 that means that's relative 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.159
 almost every objectively size you look at 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.320
 you can imagine the right thing 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.610
 here in the example are 52 mm screwed 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.920
 just the one and the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.360
 then you put the rings light yourself 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.220
 simply for that are at the side 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.930
 Two little rules that one together 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.729
 pushes then these disappear 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.009
 this little plastic 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.530
 claws we have here and that 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.049
 you just stop in the 1 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.400
 Inserting the top lets start the whole and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.110
 then it is fixed it turns 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.890
 of course, in itself it clear that but 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 in principle i can do it perfectly 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 irrelevant 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 and then we have to stop here just to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 the back and another 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 Camera setting then the operation 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.580
 unit where we then control everything 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.590
 Can be located on the back 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.270
 then here the switchboard if you like that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.290
 wants to be on the side is the battery compartment 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.570
 Of course, I'm talking about batteries 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.740
 It's a matter of course and we do it 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.970
 it will simply talk on the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 back of our art in a few 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.259
 look at functions there is also one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.160
 small instructions and you can 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.440
 then just stop and for stage 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 lead and then has just the whole 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.959
 functions in detail again 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.250
 read something really big now 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.000
 scientifically that's not all 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 self explanatory 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.959
 the whole thing is activated by having 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 turn on this wheel around here 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.410
 first to get into operation 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.970
 I'll change between the two 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.260
 lightning focus and the different 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.760
 adjust where the back and forth 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.989
 what exactly is on it to show 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 we can also do the here 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.620
 upper half and the lower half of the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.700
 activate led and of course here then 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.260
 Also in this case, which is then 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.459
 have done and middle and you can do that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.080
 a bit I see out my hand 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.060
 hold accordingly also the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.709
 set intensity that is so is 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.760
 it's the brightest and if I have it now 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.890
 You can also see down in the rules 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.630
 background where there is something again 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 it gets darker then you have it 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.930
 about what I just said with 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.519
 the divisions shows the best 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.930
 now just from the beginning and then 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.579
 We can also now assess us 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
 to look at everything from the beginning what I am 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.959
 So I told all once here 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.799
 History with the intensity of the LEDs 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.450
 are installed 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.660
 that we can regulate once from 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.940
 very dark she wants to stop 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 really bright and then we still have the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.250
 option that we can go here and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.350
 can say 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.790
 we only do subareas so that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.410
 whole is not meant for left 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.910
 and right or just down 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.079
 and that explains itself next to it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.730
 why just free it here ? 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.380
 variable is it's not that easy 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 it just snaps around a little one 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.560
 Resistance is already there but that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.850
 included him and the fact that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.959
 we just needed that so that we could 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.890
 hold accordingly here the whole 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.440
 can adjust 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 So we have a change here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440
 pages we have here and of course 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.300
 then it has the full mode 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.620
 and of course it also has the lightning 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.120
 mode to which the resulting art 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.560
 can stop just so synonymous with it 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.610
 then to flash in the moment becomes 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.650
 of course he has the permanent light 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.840
 switched off and then we can stop 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.970
 just very loose fluffy and lively here 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.170
 just let's start flashing we just do 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.330
 short is not on again 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.560
 and that has a full power too 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.240
 It was already as I said there needs 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.600
 you do not have any big instructions for that 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.040
 everything is self-explanatory 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.959
 the scope of delivery includes so once the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.760
 people even then we have this whole 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.500
 many adapters are there too 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.790
 my product text look which sizes 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.680
 has since exactly is everything 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.540
 here from the smallest size like 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.709
 I stayed that way 46 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.750
 mm 49 mm up to 58 if I have that 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.299
 right in mind I have 77 here 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.550
 but as I said the best on the website 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.990
 Just after and what I just hold 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.460
 personally now completely again 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.540
 I find interesting that this light 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.760
 of course, regardless of it 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.620
 always works as a permanent light for it 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.180
 just want to use without them 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.950
 So it's attached to a camera 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.570
 the whole but only turned on and 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.710
 now just in the moment if 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.120
 I take pictures of something now 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.470
 I would like to have a light accent somewhere 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.180
 need and then i can shine this light 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.310
 theoretically easy to him about it 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.540
 make me head over a microphone 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.890
 Example or just easy 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.720
 somehow not active above 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.340
 everything has just that through the version 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.440
 fit in here and then I can stop 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.430
 Just here then regulate the light 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.360
 that is completely, for example 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.830
 interesting if you like a bit 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.240
 miniature photography operates and then 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.110
 simply that you as a light source easy 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.460
 used 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.780
 I 've used that too before 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.030
 for product photography that's all 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.270
 very wonderful so that here the 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.520
 actors the amaral halo led-flash and 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.720
 ring light once for nikon cameras 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.729
 I based it all year 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.330
 from the example nikon at each 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.330
 presented
