00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 Oh I think a bit more on the receipts and I'm still on my computer 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.480

 And in fact, I know it at college. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.440
 When I'm eating the University of Kaltag complaints 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.910
 It would come when I say one day or did the day it left the Greaves form 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 My mother would not like it. 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 I would rather stand he boiled chicken feet to his sindang-dong like a rice cake server scratching 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 He wanted to eat in a long time that I'm there at the end of its party the manhole 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 Oh, but the transition of thought, now you have to pay off your debt somehow. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.000
 You should have something in that wall when you did . 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.370

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:33.350
 Oh, do not speed it up. It's so wide. 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.500
 How about that when I opened it, I covered eight tables with 10 tables. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:43.730
 Unconditional anything at first, red Can I prepare anything Perfect 100% Era 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:49.460
 Yes, and then some of the guests 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:53.240
 It's the expectations back then look back to a place I'd rather not go back in again 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.220
 Even though coming Hey how tasty chips itgilrae no place in anyone called 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.300

 Once you sit down and eat a little bit of food or go wrong 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.179

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.680
 Food was terrible food Lotta Country gonna andoeyo 40 minutes then cut out 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.360
 But also Shin Gun malraneun turn except the bread when the bread table, two banks, because 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.350
 When there is no mood on a winter day, the guests will surely have bread . 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.740
 The guests who came in at the beginning gave the rice cake, 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.550
 After all, because there the spirit eat bread Order've covered so the way I feel

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.930
 When it's prologue jjaera claimed some way reminds me so, so often caught 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.579

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.500
 Will it be 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.250

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.980
 I'd rather give them frustration than actually hoping. 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.299
 Well, that's not what it 's like when you start a van door . 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.599
 Sometimes, 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:26.610

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:30.629

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.900
 So there is one change I'm frustrated first 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.580
 If that is easy to do what should not you do not think so. But God, 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.139
 There was a good house. 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.850
 But now that's the best decision I can make, but I can not give it to you. 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.900

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:47.910
