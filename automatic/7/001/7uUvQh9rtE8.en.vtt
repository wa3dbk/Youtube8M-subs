00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.940
 At first we paint base gun 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:17.390
 Yes When pushed up to the line the last minute to come Teke give a smooth stop When you put in front 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.680
 I pour it cleanly 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.400
 While looking at Nishimichi well 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.190
 The masu around to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.800
 The opposite side is also firmly 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.330
 The research is 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.160
 right 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.420
 Touch the center and the last 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 I will inform you with the run 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.770
 First of all , it is said that shea formal pink which becomes the color of the base 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.040
 I will apply 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 Three side dishes 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.860
 If you are in the middle, push up hard and go to the last minute 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.080
 I will attack my eyes from there 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.080
 Flowing and smooth stop to the center 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:11.170
 If you do n't eat the color , give it a little and then paint it all over 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.240
 Because this share formal pink is a color with a sense of transparency 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 There's never been a color muramuki- if it gets wet overall 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.150
 Lightly can batch to the tip 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 I will go in each 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.420
 Yes 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 Then I will paint twice 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.200
 Just as the from identity will generally spread Once you finish your hand from the middle rather than this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200
 I will 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.010
 In the same way, it is for the purpose to be held firmly to the tip and to improve the possession as well . 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.010
 I will catch 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.049
 If so , take it to the pearl beige off hand that I will make it a pearl beige check 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.720
 From the root 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.289
 Straight 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 I will draw 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.910
 If color disappears 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 Go forward 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 Forever 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.270
 This little by little if he is possibly to have a stretch Hiku' 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.770
 If you proceed straight image while 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.770
 It may be easy to write 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:39.110
 Even if it bends at this time, it is all right without worrying at all 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.750
 The part where I cut off the brush which has been made beautiful 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.270
 I'll wipe the backup 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.270
 I will make it straight 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.540
 Soshitara taking the same color brush in order to continue to darker Well one more time 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.730
 Pile up 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.390
 It will be clear the line 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:14.310
 At this time, the bag wipes out just like before 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:18.050
 I say it wipes and cleans it , so I don't have to worry about it. 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.050
 The color is wet evenly 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.349
 Take a ship that is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.060
 Straight 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.060
 I will strike 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 Hmm 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.300
 Feeling 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.730
 Then I will draw a horizontal line next time 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.730
 As a rule of thumb 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:54.800
 Imagine about half sealed half 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.940
 I will continue to draw good 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.890
 It's snowing you can't do it 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.870
 Covert painting is fine 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.680
 It was just as clean as Freddie. 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.680
 Wipe 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.470
 Here 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.470
 Wipe 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.910
 think 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.180
 If you do 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:37.320
 Take to the mat pink beige off hand 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:41.009
 I will put a thinner line than before The place in the Saffle is the base side and the tip side Overall 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 I will see the balance 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.150
 Suddenly 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.750
 Slender 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.449
 I have a line but at this time I firmly 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.590
 Fix it 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.590
 Family and cherry blossom 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:06.520
 Since the thickness of the line becomes too thick if it gets stuck, it is fixed firmly and the number 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.520
 I will play with the same guy 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.940
 Then I mixed lame gold with clear gel 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.600
 Lame gel 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:30.050
 I will enter 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:33.750
 It is the other side of the vertical line of this beige as a standard to keep going over painting 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.289
 I will go here 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:42.949
 This in licking the Tteyuu included to juice the is 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.949
 I can't play with one , so it's fine 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.819
 While stretching 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.889
 Straight to 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:06:01.039
 I will watch while conscious 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:04.380
 If back out at this time, backwipe the same way as before. 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:11.360
 You can wipe it and get it done 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:17.180
 Then I will draw a horizontal line where I put my nails in half 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.870
 It is half of the tip side It is here Coco is the middle which I made the beige line half here . 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.200
 I pulled it in half so this time 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.200
 I will also draw a gold line in half 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.830
 Let's go to scatter the waves without today 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:40.090
 As we pull 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.300
 Move in detail 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.840
 Not 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.840
 To go 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.250
 Last 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:57.680
 It is finger top gel with Yui Top gel wiping 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:59.139
 I'm going to paint this too much from the root and put it a little in front and push it up 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.840
 Like that 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.840
 Please load the color as a whole 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.650
 If you paint evenly on the whole, firmly lower the tip 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.970
 I'm addicted 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.970
 I burnt with light
