for<00:00:01.689> many<00:00:01.840> years<00:00:02.110> we<00:00:02.470> built<00:00:02.770> a<00:00:03.040> rectangular<00:00:04.000> or

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
for many years we built a rectangular or

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.820 
for many years we built a rectangular or
square<00:00:05.340> type<00:00:06.340> of<00:00:06.580> maternity<00:00:07.060> pen<00:00:07.420> and<00:00:07.690> it<00:00:08.590> was

square type of maternity pen and it was

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.440 
square type of maternity pen and it was
wonderful<00:00:09.099> it<00:00:09.459> worked<00:00:09.669> great<00:00:09.849> it<00:00:10.120> was<00:00:10.240> way

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
wonderful it worked great it was way

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.959 
wonderful it worked great it was way
better<00:00:10.660> than<00:00:10.839> the<00:00:10.990> rope<00:00:11.289> and<00:00:11.499> a<00:00:11.559> post<00:00:11.969> however

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
better than the rope and a post however

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.689 
better than the rope and a post however
there<00:00:13.719> was<00:00:13.929> a<00:00:13.959> problem<00:00:14.379> to<00:00:14.769> it<00:00:14.919> and<00:00:15.099> that<00:00:15.459> is

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:15.699 
there was a problem to it and that is

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.830 
there was a problem to it and that is
that<00:00:15.909> when<00:00:16.119> this<00:00:16.330> door<00:00:17.200> would<00:00:17.470> come<00:00:17.710> around

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
that when this door would come around

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.540 
that when this door would come around
end<00:00:19.840> up<00:00:20.080> with<00:00:20.290> an<00:00:20.440> open<00:00:20.590> corner<00:00:21.310> right<00:00:21.520> here

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
end up with an open corner right here

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.040 
end up with an open corner right here
and<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.360> cow<00:00:22.570> could<00:00:22.960> come<00:00:23.260> past<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.930> away

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
and the cow could come past and get away

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.460 
and the cow could come past and get away
from<00:00:26.440> you<00:00:26.620> or<00:00:26.830> get<00:00:27.820> out<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.300> so<00:00:29.050> we<00:00:29.200> developed

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
from you or get out and so we developed

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.910 
from you or get out and so we developed

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
this one you have plenty of access to

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.300 
this one you have plenty of access to
open<00:00:37.150> up<00:00:37.540> you<00:00:38.320> do<00:00:38.590> have<00:00:39.720> some<00:00:40.720> extra<00:00:41.310> hookups

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
open up you do have some extra hookups

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.090 
open up you do have some extra hookups
for<00:00:42.400> panels<00:00:43.090> here<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.840> make<00:00:44.079> an<00:00:44.290> alleyway<00:00:44.800> if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
for panels here to make an alleyway if

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.090 
for panels here to make an alleyway if
you<00:00:45.220> wanted<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.820> run<00:00:46.060> down<00:00:46.329> into<00:00:46.600> this

as she turns you can just keep working

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.969 
as she turns you can just keep working
your<00:01:04.449> way<00:01:04.509> around<00:01:04.780> you're<00:01:05.320> standing<00:01:05.799> out<00:01:05.950> here

want a spin and turn in here we have put
a<00:01:15.430> self<00:01:15.909> catching<00:01:16.390> head<00:01:16.600> gate<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.350> and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
a self catching head gate on this and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.190 
a self catching head gate on this and
it's<00:01:18.070> our<00:01:18.340> good<00:01:18.670> heavy<00:01:19.000> head<00:01:19.270> gate<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:20.020> head

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's our good heavy head gate the head

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's our good heavy head gate the head
gate<00:01:20.409> might<00:01:20.710> even<00:01:20.979> be<00:01:21.220> over<00:01:21.549> built<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.030> might

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
gate might even be over built you might

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.930 
gate might even be over built you might
say<00:01:22.510> but<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:23.440> I'd<00:01:23.860> rather<00:01:24.159> been<00:01:24.640> working

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
say but it's I'd rather been working

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.340 
say but it's I'd rather been working
with<00:01:25.090> cattle<00:01:25.330> I'd<00:01:25.570> rather<00:01:25.750> have<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.170> be<00:01:26.320> too

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
with cattle I'd rather have it be too

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.060 
with cattle I'd rather have it be too
strong<00:01:26.860> than<00:01:27.250> not<00:01:27.460> strong<00:01:27.820> enough<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.860> is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
strong than not strong enough so this is

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.789 
strong than not strong enough so this is
a<00:01:30.100> self<00:01:30.549> catcher<00:01:30.850> ready<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.990> counter<00:01:32.500> Runyon

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
a self catcher ready to counter Runyon

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.359 
a self catcher ready to counter Runyon
and<00:01:32.890> catch<00:01:33.159> her<00:01:33.700> neck<00:01:34.119> right<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.810> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and catch her neck right in there and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.859 
and catch her neck right in there and
what<00:01:36.369> they'll<00:01:36.610> often<00:01:37.090> do<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.360> those<00:01:37.540> calls

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
what they'll often do is those calls

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.350 
what they'll often do is those calls
will<00:01:38.080> circle<00:01:38.590> around<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:39.189> once<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.549> get<00:01:39.610> where

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
will circle around and once I get where

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.270 
will circle around and once I get where
she's<00:01:40.750> headed<00:01:41.140> towards<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.710> head<00:01:42.070> gate

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
she's headed towards that head gate

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.660 
she's headed towards that head gate
opening<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.960> quickly<00:01:44.950> just<00:01:45.220> bring<00:01:45.460> this

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
opening really quickly just bring this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
opening really quickly just bring this
in<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:46.210> you've<00:01:46.450> got<00:01:46.689> her<00:01:46.900> in<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.560> position

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
in and now you've got her in a position

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.950 
in and now you've got her in a position
where<00:01:48.250> she's<00:01:48.520> facing<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.720> head<00:01:50.229> gate<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
where she's facing that head gate and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.539 
where she's facing that head gate and
eventually<00:01:52.960> she'll<00:01:53.259> try<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> get<00:01:53.920> herself<00:01:54.040> out

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
eventually she'll try to get herself out

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.510 
eventually she'll try to get herself out
and<00:01:54.939> when<00:01:55.299> she<00:01:55.479> hits<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.840> she's<00:01:56.049> locked<00:01:56.409> in<00:01:56.680> we

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
and when she hits it she's locked in we

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.539 
and when she hits it she's locked in we
added<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.030> chain<00:01:58.450> which<00:01:59.350> makes<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.369> we

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
added this chain which makes it so we

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.450 
added this chain which makes it so we
can<00:02:00.790> lock<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.720> call<00:02:01.990> about<00:02:02.740> an<00:02:02.920> inch<00:02:03.159> at<00:02:03.400> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
can lock the call about an inch at a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.529 
can lock the call about an inch at a
time

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.559 

put<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.929> link<00:02:09.170> if<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.670> squeeze<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.450> a

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
put it in a link if you can squeeze it a

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.660 
put it in a link if you can squeeze it a
