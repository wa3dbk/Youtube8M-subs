oh<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:39.760> was<00:04:39.970> horrible<00:04:40.140> actually<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:41.170> don't<00:04:41.290> know

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
oh it was horrible actually I don't know

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.700

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
it wasn't dirt it to me it tasted what

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.280 
it wasn't dirt it to me it tasted what
dirt<00:04:44.950> would<00:04:45.310> taste<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.730> but<00:04:46.480> technically<00:04:47.020> it

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
dirt would taste like but technically it

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.540 
dirt would taste like but technically it
was<00:04:47.440> onion<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.880> was<00:04:49.380> discussed<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.040> it

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.870 
which I thought that was strange since
they<00:04:56.440> mentioned<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.860> ewoks<00:04:57.220> flavor<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.790> the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
movie but they do not have earwax but

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.030 
movie but they do not have earwax but
they<00:05:01.510> had<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.690> lot<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:01.960> really<00:05:02.320> good<00:05:02.440> flavor<00:05:02.740> so

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040
