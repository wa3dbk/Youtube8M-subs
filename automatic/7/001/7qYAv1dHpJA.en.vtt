00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.189
 refunds refunds everywhere then 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.230
 we have come to tell you a lot about 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.240
 things and we got to not making you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 a decent introduction because 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 finally we have something to tell you and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 we mean to get straight to the point 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.710
 the point is in shit in fact a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 fucking dog just to ride the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.990
 fashion 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 hello hello in the shit's and now 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 we come to why we said reimbursements 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.700
 this magic word that in steam a little 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 was lacking in the sense that there were no 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.960
 safe policies to get the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 reimbursement of the cost of the game 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.200
 buy v now all have changed 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.940
 how many rules and finally it is better 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 what was the point until a few days 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.199
 the point was that any 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.899
 developer could afford to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.770
 put a pax trailer and region on 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 youtube stone simulator to tell the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.990
 crap friends would have watched 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
 that trailer pax e del ora o al 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 stone simulator we buy it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 they would have played there 15 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 minutes would be made a laugh and then 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.290
 they would have set aside the game and not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330
 only they would have set aside their own 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 9 euros and 90 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 exactly those same 9 euros and 90 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.790
 that could be used to buy 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.579
 maybe a game from the past but better 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 stone simulator 2015 also because 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.409
 with the cost of 2 stone simulator 2015 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.280
 bring home a vanishing kobe ​​ton 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 sump 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 if this is not injustice explain to us 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.119
 what the fuck should be because 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
 they really marched too far 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.220
 long on the fact that the gamer is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 basically a curious monkey e 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 buys anything you can make 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.700
 a minimum of innovation even if fake 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.909
 verissimo is finally arrived at 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.079
 steam notes that says repayments 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.479
 will be given to everyone unconditionally 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.259
 as long as you haven't played more than 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.970
 two hours 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.119
 I want to see if you can't do it in two hours 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.700
 is an idea of ​​the game and you don't tell me dark 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.860
 souls blood bowl to make up for not 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.300
 you do n't even mention them because in two hours 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 understand if you like a market and in 14 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.580
 days of time so if you play 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.650
 an hour and a half is the thirteenth day 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.630
 you want to return the game you can 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 you can do it 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.010
 it takes two hours to see if it is a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.420
 title I do not say yes I like it ok but 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.730
 it takes two hours to figure out if it's done right 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.220
 because if a title with 5 polygons a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.050
 malaga and made a shit if a title a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.270
 of the bad animations that I understand from 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.860
 immediately both a shitty combat system 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.320
 understand the first 15 minutes I do not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.080
 not even two hours for what 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.280
 it's about luigi br titles where you need to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.610
 understand the story 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.130
 well if there is a gdr and it is so long it is 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.200
 a story so deep probably 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.660
 not a shitty indie probably a 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.250
 game well done the only thing that i do 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.520
 leaves a little perplexed by this new one 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 steam policy and there are so many games 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.959
 very valid but really very beautiful 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.750
 but in a couple of hours they can be 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.709
 terminal is instead estimates tells you that if 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.230
 terms the game gave the wall ie no if 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.810
 the game ends less than two hours 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.180
 obviously the reimbursement does not take place this way 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.519
 as if not bought from steam and if 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.350
 you cannot buy an external site 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.290
 make use of this reimbursement 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.940
 well but one usually these games of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.530
 I buy shit games directly 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.959
 what is direct purchases from steam? 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.519
 that acquire external sites maybe triple 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.700
 maybe it's just the latest assassin's creed 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:47.940
 what the fuck is disappointed by the anyway 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.220
 point is that finally sting greenlight 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.940
 smes will stop being populated by 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.950
 colossal bullshit because all these 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
 developers will do nothing but make themselves 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.489
 an ass so no a way to fuck off like that 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.739
 because it doesn't take anything to do this 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.160
 to make these games all there 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.910
 will play and no one will pay them to 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 exact right 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.000
 we are very happy with this thing 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.030
 because we will reduce the number of 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.160
 so shit definitely has me jazz 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.100
 sorry always sorry but not 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.100
 they will therefore be different 2 b 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.530
 there will be no more 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.470
 no piracy will not always exist but 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.770
 maybe we have 10 to 20 percent 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.020
 knocked down because because this formula 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.290
 of steam is nothing but a stuff 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.740
 old as the cuckoo we used to call it 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.900
 demo the game demo was a game that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.760
 you could play for a total of hours e 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.050
 then you couldn't play with it anymore or 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.180
 you can play first to second 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.040
 level and then to go where 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.419
 buy the game 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.640
 good is a life we ​​are saying 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.780
 these things are enough with the ex just enough with 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.730
 this bullshit 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.550
 the demo has always been the best weapon 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.890
 against the disappointments against the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.400
 dog developers and against expenses 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.970
 unnecessary 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.340
 so guys if you like a game don't 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.419
 you will have to go more to torrent sites a 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.070
 download 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.550
 download it directly from steam vi 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.130
 maybe even 20 30 euros in the portfolio 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.010
 of steam and you can buy all the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.919
 games, try them you if you like 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.250
 download them if you like 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.830
 if not, just trust the trailers 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.010
 just trust the teasers just trust 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.450
 fucking reviews too 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.440
 what we do if we do it 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.200
 game review 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.080
 let's take the example and tell you guys 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.300
 according to us it is very nice to download it 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.430
 hand spending sodium but it is try it 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.290
 if we are right I bought it e 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.790
 you don't like it because it could be that 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.010
 we award a title to you instead 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.260
 it sucks but you do n't play it but it is 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.419
 beautiful this thing we feel also 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.740
 We advise you not guilty of 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.960
 titles because if we recommend a 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.810
 triple title that costs 60 euros 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.400
 well here we are sorry maybe 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.650
 advisable which you do not like 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.390
 yes I recommend you share this 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.030
 video do not let it expire in 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.960
 forgotten because it's one thing 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.850
 important 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.639
 here we talk about a real one 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.639
 Revolution 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.830
 in the field of video games because estimates 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.490
 the largest platform in the world of 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.289
 video games 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.330
 if it gives you the opportunity to have a 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.949
 make it known to your repayment 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.949
 friends applause to steam
