00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.520 
so two cups of water at 60 degrees and
let's<00:02:43.269> see<00:02:43.420> how<00:02:43.540> long<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:43.900> takes<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
let's see how long this takes to get to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.809 
let's see how long this takes to get to
a<00:02:44.680> boil<00:02:46.709> okay<00:02:47.709> we're<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.010> at<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.220> two-minute

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
a boil okay we're now at the two-minute

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.430 
a boil okay we're now at the two-minute
mark<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.239> temperatures<00:02:49.780> up<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:49.989> about<00:02:50.140> one

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
mark the temperatures up to about one

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.350 
mark the temperatures up to about one
hundred<00:02:50.470> four<00:02:50.890> hundred<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.250> five<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.850> rising

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
hundred four hundred and five and rising

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750 
hundred four hundred and five and rising
I<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:53.739> know<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.130> see<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.430> from<00:02:54.549> this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I don't know if you can see it from this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.740 
I don't know if you can see it from this
camera<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.660> quite<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> large<00:02:56.410> flame

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
camera but this is quite a large flame

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.259 
camera but this is quite a large flame
the<00:02:58.750> whole<00:02:59.410> cube<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.489> enveloped<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:01.390> flame

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
the whole cube is enveloped in flame

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.470 
the whole cube is enveloped in flame
smells

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
smells

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.030 
smells
I<00:03:05.370> don't<00:03:06.370> not<00:03:06.610> quite<00:03:07.120> as<00:03:07.299> bad<00:03:07.510> as<00:03:07.720> estimate<00:03:08.170> but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
I don't not quite as bad as estimate but

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.720 
I don't not quite as bad as estimate but
there<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> smell<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:11.010> let's<00:03:12.010> see<00:03:12.580> how

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
there is a smell to it so let's see how

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.370 
there is a smell to it so let's see how
long<00:03:12.880> this<00:03:13.060> takes<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.810> boil

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
long this takes to get to a boil

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.940 
long this takes to get to a boil
they<00:03:14.799> we<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.250> ten<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.989> eleven<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.530> twelve

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
they we have to ten to eleven to twelve

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.810 
they we have to ten to eleven to twelve
and<00:03:21.310> five<00:03:21.549> minutes<00:03:22.000> fifty<00:03:22.480> four<00:03:26.519> okay<00:03:27.519> let's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
and five minutes fifty four okay let's

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.590 
and five minutes fifty four okay let's
see<00:03:27.970> how<00:03:28.120> long<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.510> runs<00:03:28.750> now<00:03:29.049> till<00:03:29.380> burn<00:03:29.650> out

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
see how long it runs now till burn out

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.990 
see how long it runs now till burn out
okay<00:03:31.600> their<00:03:31.840> temperature<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:32.560> dropped

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
okay their temperature just dropped

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.370 
okay their temperature just dropped
let's<00:03:34.000> say<00:03:34.239> at<00:03:34.440> 12:23<00:03:36.810> still<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> little<00:03:38.079> bit<00:03:38.290> of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
let's say at 12:23 still a little bit of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.599 
let's say at 12:23 still a little bit of
flame<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.920> there<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.109> little<00:03:41.140> bit<00:03:41.560> let<00:03:42.340> me

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
flame in there just a little bit let me

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.590 
flame in there just a little bit let me
see<00:03:46.530> let<00:03:47.530> me<00:03:47.680> empty<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.250> out<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.819> don't<00:03:49.540> know

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
see let me empty this out I don't know

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.879 
see let me empty this out I don't know
if<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.109> just<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.709> bit<00:03:50.799> of

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
if you can see just a little bit of

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:59.110 
if you can see just a little bit of
flame<00:03:51.100> there<00:03:51.310> still<00:03:51.549> going

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.339 

okay<00:04:01.629> pardon<00:04:02.629> my<00:04:02.780> elbow<00:04:03.170> vent<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.959> with<00:04:06.200> this

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
okay pardon my elbow vent so with this

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.259 
okay pardon my elbow vent so with this
one<00:04:06.590> two<00:04:06.830> cups<00:04:07.069> of<00:04:07.160> water<00:04:07.370> starting<00:04:07.790> at<00:04:07.879> 60

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
one two cups of water starting at 60

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.320 
one two cups of water starting at 60
degrees<00:04:08.769> came<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:09.950> boil<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.610> five<00:04:10.940> minutes

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
degrees came to a boil in five minutes

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.729 
degrees came to a boil in five minutes
54<00:04:11.870> seconds<00:04:12.440> with<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.830> S<00:04:12.980> bit<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:14.420> was<00:04:14.739> two

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
54 seconds with the S bit it was two

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.800 
54 seconds with the S bit it was two
cups<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.070> water<00:04:16.220> sixty<00:04:16.609> degrees<00:04:16.970> came<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.780> a

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
cups of water sixty degrees came to a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.860 
cups of water sixty degrees came to a
boil<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.410> six<00:04:18.769> minutes<00:04:18.979> one<00:04:19.430> second<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.660> this

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
boil in six minutes one second so this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.969 
boil in six minutes one second so this
is<00:04:21.049> what<00:04:21.320> seven<00:04:21.859> seconds<00:04:22.340> faster<00:04:22.850> Wow<00:04:23.979> then

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
is what seven seconds faster Wow then

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.490 
is what seven seconds faster Wow then
run<00:04:25.370> out<00:04:25.550> on<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.240> today<00:04:26.510> was<00:04:26.810> twelve<00:04:27.169> minutes

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
run out on this today was twelve minutes

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.240 
run out on this today was twelve minutes
23<00:04:28.120> on<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.840> estimate<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.500> was<00:04:30.620> 11<00:04:30.979> minutes

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
23 on the estimate it was 11 minutes

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.860 
23 on the estimate it was 11 minutes
five<00:04:31.520> seconds<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:35.150> little<00:04:35.660> bit

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
five seconds so that's a little bit

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.480 
five seconds so that's a little bit
better<00:04:36.050> than<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.320> minute<00:04:36.680> longer<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.220> still

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
better than a minute longer it still

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.170 
better than a minute longer it still
burned<00:04:38.440> now<00:04:39.440> as<00:04:39.620> far<00:04:39.830> as<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.669> underside<00:04:41.150> of

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
burned now as far as the underside of

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.990 
burned now as far as the underside of
the<00:04:41.419> pots<00:04:42.550> very<00:04:43.550> sooty<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:45.370> don't<00:04:46.370> see<00:04:46.550> any<00:04:46.700> big

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
the pots very sooty I don't see any big

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.110 
the pots very sooty I don't see any big
buildup<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:48.950> with<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.669> estimate<00:04:50.090> there

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
buildup like on with the estimate there

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.840 
buildup like on with the estimate there
was<00:04:50.419> some<00:04:50.570> really<00:04:50.900> crusty<00:04:51.200> stuff<00:04:51.500> here<00:04:52.070> this

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
was some really crusty stuff here this

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.560 
was some really crusty stuff here this
kind<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.360> looks<00:04:53.600> like<00:04:53.690> soot<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:56.270> that'll

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
kind of just looks like soot so that'll

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.670 
kind of just looks like soot so that'll
wash<00:04:56.750> off<00:04:58.090> as<00:04:59.090> far<00:04:59.389> as<00:04:59.539> price<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.139> between<00:05:00.350> the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
wash off as far as price is between the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.310 
wash off as far as price is between the
two<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:01.010> these<00:05:01.160> they're<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.600> same<00:05:02.810> for<00:05:03.169> what<00:05:03.289> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
two of these they're the same for what I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.680 
two of these they're the same for what I
got<00:05:03.620> them<00:05:03.770> at<00:05:04.180> twelve<00:05:05.180> tablets<00:05:06.220> for<00:05:07.300> 595<00:05:08.300> and

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
got them at twelve tablets for 595 and

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.840 
got them at twelve tablets for 595 and
that's<00:05:09.440> what<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.650> paid<00:05:09.979> for<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.340> estimate<00:05:10.669> also

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
that's what I paid for the estimate also

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.510 
that's what I paid for the estimate also
at<00:05:11.090> twelve<00:05:11.389> tablets<00:05:11.800> 595<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.280> don't<00:05:16.430> know<00:05:16.490> I

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
at twelve tablets 595 so I don't know I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.830 
at twelve tablets 595 so I don't know I
guess<00:05:16.849> they're<00:05:17.720> somewhat<00:05:18.440> comparable<00:05:19.840> burn

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
guess they're somewhat comparable burn

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.400 
guess they're somewhat comparable burn
about<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.260> same<00:05:21.500> burn<00:05:22.160> a<00:05:22.190> little<00:05:22.400> bit<00:05:22.639> longer

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
about the same burn a little bit longer
