sure<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> production<00:01:42.180> run<00:01:42.329> won't<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sure the production run won't go for a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.069 
sure the production run won't go for a
long<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:43.680> they'll<00:01:43.920> produce<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.280> few<00:01:44.460> runs<00:01:45.079> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
long time they'll produce a few runs and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
long time they'll produce a few runs and
then<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> gonna<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> production<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
then it's gonna go out of production and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
then it's gonna go out of production and
they're<00:01:48.149> gonna<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.420> hard<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.380> that's

according to the design you can almost

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.100
