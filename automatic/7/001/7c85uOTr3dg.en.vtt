much foundation comes out so it's called

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.839 
much foundation comes out so it's called
the<00:00:27.720> power<00:00:28.410> definition<00:00:29.070> foundation<00:00:29.699> which

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the power definition foundation which

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.569 
the power definition foundation which
means<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.449> good<00:00:31.099> for<00:00:32.099> taking

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
means it's really good for taking

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
means it's really good for taking
pictures<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> wouldn't<00:00:33.930> come<00:00:34.140> off

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
pictures with so it wouldn't come off

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
pictures with so it wouldn't come off
looking<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:35.040> funny<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.610> pictures<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
looking really funny on pictures but a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
looking really funny on pictures but a
downside<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.460> doesn't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> SPF

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
downside to that is it doesn't have SPF

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
downside to that is it doesn't have SPF
if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> foundation<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
if you are going to use a foundation you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
if you are going to use a foundation you
probably<00:00:41.700> should<00:00:42.090> use<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> moisturizer<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
probably should use a moisturizer that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
probably should use a moisturizer that
has<00:00:43.860> SPF<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.850> obviously<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
has SPF because obviously you want to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
has SPF because obviously you want to
protect<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.559> skin<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.280> Sun<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
protect your skin from the Sun this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.650 
protect your skin from the Sun this
foundation<00:00:48.600> does<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.200> SPF<00:00:50.190> protection

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
foundation does not have SPF protection

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
foundation does not have SPF protection
so<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.020> combination<00:00:52.559> oily<00:00:52.739> skin<00:00:53.190> which

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so I have combination oily skin which

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
so I have combination oily skin which
was<00:00:53.610> obviously<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.300> oily<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.809> t-zone<00:00:55.039> or

do<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.740> say<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> medium<00:01:59.790> coverage

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
do I would say this is a medium coverage

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.270 
do I would say this is a medium coverage
but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.390> much<00:02:03.950> like<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
but I don't have to use so much like it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.850 
but I don't have to use so much like it
seems<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> cover<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.119> face<00:02:06.590> quite<00:02:07.590> well<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
seems to cover my face quite well it

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.130 
seems to cover my face quite well it
 is<00:02:09.369> kind<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> on<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.420> yellow<00:02:10.720> east<00:02:10.930> side

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
 is kind of on the yellow east side

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.370 
 is kind of on the yellow east side
slightly<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.060> still<00:02:13.210> okay<00:02:13.630> because<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.050> I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
slightly but it's still okay because I I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.230 
slightly but it's still okay because I I
have<00:02:14.770> mixed<00:02:15.100> your<00:02:15.220> red<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.610> yellow<00:02:15.700> undertone

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240

have mixed your red and yellow undertone
to<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.630> face<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.220> okay<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.060> know

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.150 
to my face so this is okay for you know
for<00:02:19.450> matching<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.380> use<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.740> concealer

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
for matching and I use my concealer

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
for matching and I use my concealer
which<00:02:21.520> has<00:02:21.760> more<00:02:21.970> red<00:02:22.270> undertones<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.140> source

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
which has more red undertones to source

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.430 
which has more red undertones to source
of<00:02:23.980> balance<00:02:24.280> all<00:02:24.490> out<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:26.080> terms<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
of balance all out so in terms of the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.250 
of balance all out so in terms of the
color<00:02:26.650> matching<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.400> fine<00:02:27.700> when<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> apply<00:02:28.900> my

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260

color matching it's fine when I apply my
concealer<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.730> when<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.090> apply<00:02:31.270> my<00:02:31.420> powder<00:02:31.630> I

to<00:02:36.130> deep<00:02:36.490> dark<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:36.970> cuz<00:02:37.150> I've<00:02:37.300> really<00:02:38.200> seen

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
to deep dark now cuz I've really seen

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.340 
to deep dark now cuz I've really seen
that<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.760> actually<00:02:40.240> looks<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.810> lot<00:02:40.959> better<00:02:41.080> on

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
that it actually looks a lot better on

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.280

me<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:42.070> it's<00:02:42.250> called<00:02:42.430> dark<00:02:42.700> deep<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:44.050> it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
me well it's called dark deep now so it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.410 
me well it's called dark deep now so it
looks<00:02:44.500> fine<00:02:44.770> with<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.670> says<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.240> meant

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
looks fine with that it says it's meant

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.510 
looks fine with that it says it's meant
to<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.570> oil-free<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.830> dries<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.489> matte

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
to be oil-free and it dries to a matte

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.479 
to be oil-free and it dries to a matte
finish<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.170> free<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.830> still<00:02:51.190> find

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790

you can't get tip in a particular store
in<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.210> UK<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:36.690> it's<00:05:36.780> definitely<00:05:36.960> available

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
in the UK but it's definitely available

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.740

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.529 
only difference is the Lancome one looks
a<00:06:00.090> lot<00:06:00.360> more<00:06:00.690> natural<00:06:02.030> looking<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:03.330> makes

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
but compared to that so you know how I

but compared to that so you know how I
don't<00:07:10.670> how<00:07:11.060> I<00:07:11.090> feel<00:07:11.330> about<00:07:11.450> that<00:07:11.720> foundation

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410 
don't how I feel about that foundation

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.340 
don't how I feel about that foundation
that<00:07:12.590> velvet<00:07:13.580> plus<00:07:13.820> I<00:07:14.150> would<00:07:14.930> go<00:07:15.080> for<00:07:15.260> this

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
that velvet plus I would go for this

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.440 
that velvet plus I would go for this
because<00:07:15.530> it's<00:07:15.710> just<00:07:15.830> easy<00:07:16.040> application<00:07:16.550> but

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
because it's just easy application but

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.630 
because it's just easy application but
like<00:07:17.660> I<00:07:17.780> said<00:07:17.930> it's<00:07:18.080> mixed<00:07:18.350> reviews<00:07:18.740> so<00:07:19.070> it's<00:07:19.490> I

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
like I said it's mixed reviews so it's I

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.370 
like I said it's mixed reviews so it's I
think<00:07:19.910> I<00:07:20.090> would<00:07:20.240> suggest<00:07:20.360> getting<00:07:20.690> a<00:07:20.900> tester

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.380 
think I would suggest getting a tester

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.500 
think I would suggest getting a tester
and<00:07:21.650> try<00:07:22.160> it<00:07:22.220> out<00:07:22.460> and<00:07:22.790> see<00:07:23.090> how<00:07:23.210> you<00:07:23.270> feel

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.510 
and try it out and see how you feel

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.270 
and try it out and see how you feel
about<00:07:23.600> it<00:07:24.020> before<00:07:24.380> you<00:07:24.410> purchase<00:07:24.650> a<00:07:24.920> full-size

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
about it before you purchase a full-size

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.310 
about it before you purchase a full-size
just<00:07:26.150> because<00:07:26.390> there<00:07:26.540> are<00:07:26.570> different<00:07:26.960> reviews

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320 
just because there are different reviews

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.140 
just because there are different reviews
on<00:07:27.560> this<00:07:28.070> foundation<00:07:28.220> and<00:07:28.760> does<00:07:28.970> work

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 
on this foundation and does work

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.220 
on this foundation and does work
differently<00:07:29.630> on<00:07:29.720> different<00:07:30.200> skin<00:07:30.980> types<00:07:31.220> so

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.230 
differently on different skin types so

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.720 
differently on different skin types so
that's<00:07:33.230> pretty<00:07:33.530> much<00:07:33.740> it<00:07:34.010> I<00:07:34.160> hope<00:07:34.370> this<00:07:34.580> was

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:34.730 
that's pretty much it I hope this was

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.250 
that's pretty much it I hope this was
informative<00:07:34.880> I<00:07:35.480> hope<00:07:35.600> that's<00:07:35.750> helped<00:07:36.020> you<00:07:36.140> if

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
informative I hope that's helped you if

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.060

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.070 
you're wanting to try out this

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.610 
you're wanting to try out this
foundation<00:07:37.610> I<00:07:37.760> like<00:07:38.240> it<00:07:38.510> but<00:07:39.050> I<00:07:39.110> just<00:07:39.410> don't

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
foundation I like it but I just don't

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.710 
foundation I like it but I just don't
like<00:07:39.860> the<00:07:40.070> fact<00:07:40.280> that<00:07:40.460> it<00:07:40.640> doesn't<00:07:41.240> stay<00:07:41.450> matte

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
like the fact that it doesn't stay matte

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.010 
like the fact that it doesn't stay matte
for<00:07:41.990> a<00:07:42.050> long<00:07:42.200> time<00:07:42.470> it<00:07:42.850> gets<00:07:43.850> really<00:07:44.120> oily<00:07:44.330> it

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.020 
for a long time it gets really oily it

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.950 
for a long time it gets really oily it
kind<00:07:45.320> of<00:07:45.350> reminds<00:07:45.680> me<00:07:45.800> of<00:07:45.920> the<00:07:46.190> M<00:07:46.370> of<00:07:47.000> the<00:07:47.180> of<00:07:47.480> my

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 
kind of reminds me of the M of the of my

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.220 
kind of reminds me of the M of the of my
matte<00:07:48.140> foundations<00:07:48.800> but<00:07:49.190> I<00:07:49.570> think<00:07:50.570> if<00:07:50.810> we<00:07:51.200> use

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.230 
matte foundations but I think if we use

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.770 
matte foundations but I think if we use
a<00:07:51.380> really<00:07:51.740> good<00:07:51.890> primer<00:07:52.300> or<00:07:53.300> like<00:07:53.480> a<00:07:53.510> good

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780 
a really good primer or like a good

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.720 
a really good primer or like a good
powder<00:07:54.170> to<00:07:54.500> set<00:07:54.710> it<00:07:54.980> it<00:07:55.190> should<00:07:55.370> work<00:07:55.580> better

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:55.730 
powder to set it it should work better

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.760 
powder to set it it should work better
so<00:07:56.390> thank<00:07:56.690> you<00:07:56.780> for<00:07:56.930> watching<00:07:57.320> and<00:07:57.650> I'll<00:07:57.740> see
