update it has been 11 days and we have
more<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:45.090> people<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:46.260> is<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.620> one<00:01:46.770> box

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
more more people this is just one box

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.010 
more more people this is just one box
out<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> five<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.730> have<00:01:47.910> they<00:01:48.870> all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
out of the five that I have they all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
out of the five that I have they all
look<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:49.230> much<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.830> this<00:01:50.010> this<00:01:50.220> one's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
look pretty much like this this one's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.770 
look pretty much like this this one's
probably<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.570> most

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
probably the one that's the most

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
probably the one that's the most
advanced<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.670> only<00:01:53.790> has<00:01:53.970> five<00:01:54.150> super

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
advanced so this one only has five super

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.040 
advanced so this one only has five super
warms<00:01:54.690> left<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:57.630> bust<00:01:57.870> out<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
warms left there probably bust out of

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.760 
warms left there probably bust out of
there<00:01:58.260> today

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
there today

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
here so that they were really kind of

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.140 
here so that they were really kind of
creamy<00:03:13.260> still<00:03:13.590> looking<00:03:13.920> those<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:14.850> those<00:03:15.090> are

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
creamy still looking those are those are

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.640 
creamy still looking those are those are
still<00:03:15.510> got<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> ways<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.959> go<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.230> then<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
still got a ways to go and then you have

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
still got a ways to go and then you have
others<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:18.000> kind<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.269> look<00:03:18.390> burnt<00:03:18.660> almost

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
others that kind of look burnt almost

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.930 
others that kind of look burnt almost
they<00:03:19.380> look<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:20.160> they're<00:03:20.310> dying<00:03:20.519> or

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
they look like like they're dying or

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.310 
they look like like they're dying or
something<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.480> they're<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:22.140> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
something like that they're not that's a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.640 
something like that they're not that's a
that's<00:03:22.500> part<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.799> their<00:03:22.920> metamorphosis<00:03:24.650> after

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that's part of their metamorphosis after

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.259 
that's part of their metamorphosis after
they<00:03:25.739> turn<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.100> real<00:03:26.310> dark<00:03:26.730> kind<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.060> burnt

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
they turn that real dark kind of burnt

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.780 
they turn that real dark kind of burnt
color<00:03:27.510> they<00:03:28.200> pop<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.830> they<00:03:28.890> turn<00:03:29.100> into<00:03:29.220> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
color they pop out and they turn into to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.160 
color they pop out and they turn into to
those<00:03:29.940> guys<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.810> then<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.989> guess

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
those guys right there and then I guess

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
those guys right there and then I guess
from<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.530> they<00:03:32.130> pop<00:03:32.340> out<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.760> they<00:03:32.850> turn

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
from there they pop out and they turn

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.509 
from there they pop out and they turn
into<00:03:33.180> those<00:03:33.390> guys<00:03:33.630> right<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
into those guys right there and then I

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.550 
into those guys right there and then I
guess<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.820> get<00:03:35.940> them<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.959> seen<00:03:37.200> beetles

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
guess to get them I have seen beetles

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.020 
guess to get them I have seen beetles
before<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.070> they're<00:03:38.160> they're<00:03:38.370> much<00:03:38.610> like

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
before and they're they're much like

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
before and they're they're much like
darker<00:03:39.660> they're<00:03:39.840> they're<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.410> jet<00:03:40.709> black

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
darker they're they're really jet black

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.520 
darker they're they're really jet black
so<00:03:41.760> I'm<00:03:41.970> gonna<00:03:42.269> leave<00:03:42.420> these<00:03:42.570> guys<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.989> here

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so I'm gonna leave these guys in here

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.020 
so I'm gonna leave these guys in here
have<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.800> real<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.220> nice<00:03:44.459> dark<00:03:44.790> black

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
have that real like nice dark black

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.910 
have that real like nice dark black
color<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.600> don't<00:03:45.870> want<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> take<00:03:46.350> them<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.650> too

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
color I don't want to take them out too

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640 
color I don't want to take them out too
soon<00:03:47.240> all<00:03:48.240> beetles<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:48.900> seem<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.319> be<00:03:49.410> eating

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
soon all beetles do seem to be eating

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.160 
soon all beetles do seem to be eating
they're<00:03:50.780> like<00:03:51.780> sheds<00:03:52.140> they're<00:03:52.530> pupae<00:03:52.890> sheds

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
they're like sheds they're pupae sheds

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.710 
they're like sheds they're pupae sheds
so<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> guess<00:03:55.470> that's<00:03:55.680> that's<00:03:56.010> normal

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
so I guess that's that's normal

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.930 
so I guess that's that's normal

worms<00:06:26.720> to<00:06:26.990> morph<00:06:27.200> to<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.800> start<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.100> whole

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
worms to morph to to start the whole

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.250 
worms to morph to to start the whole
process<00:06:28.280> over<00:06:28.730> again<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:29.060> turn<00:06:29.180> the<00:06:29.360> pupa<00:06:29.690> by

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
process over again to turn the pupa by

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.810 
process over again to turn the pupa by
the<00:06:30.320> time<00:06:30.590> they're<00:06:30.770> turning<00:06:30.980> into<00:06:31.190> pupae<00:06:31.610> and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
the time they're turning into pupae and

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.610 
the time they're turning into pupae and
starting<00:06:32.630> their<00:06:32.750> whole<00:06:32.870> process<00:06:33.230> to<00:06:33.320> turn<00:06:33.440> the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
starting their whole process to turn the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.980 
starting their whole process to turn the
beetles<00:06:33.920> these<00:06:34.550> should<00:06:35.150> all<00:06:35.360> be<00:06:35.480> dead<00:06:35.690> and

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
beetles these should all be dead and

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.750 
beetles these should all be dead and
they<00:06:36.290> should<00:06:36.470> be<00:06:36.590> in<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.740> nursery<00:06:37.040> working<00:06:37.610> on

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
they should be in the nursery working on

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.410 
they should be in the nursery working on
