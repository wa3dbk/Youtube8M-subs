00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
get outside of the map and under the map

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.860 
get outside of the map and under the map
now<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:11.639> an<00:00:11.759> old<00:00:11.969> method<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.540> order<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
now there was an old method in order to

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.120 
now there was an old method in order to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the same thing but on the other side you

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.019 
the same thing but on the other side you
need<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.990> strafe<00:00:16.320> jump<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> left<00:00:17.520> side<00:00:17.760> of

need to strafe jump to the left side of

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.400 
need to strafe jump to the left side of
this<00:00:18.240> building<00:00:18.570> over<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.170> pull

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
this building over here and then pull

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
this building over here and then pull
back<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> can<00:00:20.640> land<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> roof<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
get on the barrier you're able to get on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.470 
get on the barrier you're able to get on
top<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> different<00:00:23.910> roofs<00:00:24.150> however

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
top of a lot of different roofs however

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570 
top of a lot of different roofs however
you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:24.900> fall<00:00:25.260> under<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.740> map<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.130> I'm

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you can also fall under the map and I'm

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.679 
you can also fall under the map and I'm
also<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.180> showing<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.420> guys<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
also going to be showing you guys the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
also going to be showing you guys the
old<00:00:27.810> method<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> old<00:00:28.320> method<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> little

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
old method the old method was a little

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.140 
old method the old method was a little
bit<00:00:29.099> harder<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:29.910> why

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
bit harder for me I don't know why

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
bit harder for me I don't know why
pulling<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.990> strafe<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.650> bit<00:00:31.769> more

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
pulling that strafe is a little bit more

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.530 
pulling that strafe is a little bit more
challenging<00:00:32.430> however<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> lot<00:00:33.120> easier<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
challenging however it's a lot easier to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.389 
challenging however it's a lot easier to
get<00:00:33.660> outside<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> map<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.070> hopefully

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
get outside of the map now so hopefully

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.860 
get outside of the map now so hopefully
Infinity<00:00:35.790> Ward<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.149> patch<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.570> other<00:00:36.690> way

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
Infinity Ward will patch the other way

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
Infinity Ward will patch the other way
so<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.170> way<00:00:37.260> people<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> online

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
so that way people don't use this online

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
so that way people don't use this online
because<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.149> able<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> pick<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.690> other

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
because you are able to pick up other

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
because you are able to pick up other
weapons<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> shoot<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:41.129> under<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
weapons and shoot people from under the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.310 
weapons and shoot people from under the
map<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> glitch<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> definitely<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> game

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
map so this glitch is definitely a game

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.360 
map so this glitch is definitely a game
breaker<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.770> anyway<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.280> moving

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
breaker but anyway we're gonna be moving

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
breaker but anyway we're gonna be moving
on<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.059> practical<00:00:45.270> things<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
on to some really practical things that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
on to some really practical things that
happen<00:00:46.320> throughout<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> map<00:00:46.829> these<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
happen throughout the map these are a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
happen throughout the map these are a
lot<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> dynamic<00:00:48.329> things<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.870> happen<00:00:49.170> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
lot of the dynamic things that happen in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
lot of the dynamic things that happen in
the<00:00:49.320> map<00:00:49.469> starting<00:00:49.950> off<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:51.000> shoot

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the map starting off here you can shoot

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.939 
the map starting off here you can shoot
or<00:00:51.480> knife<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.989> door<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> order<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.770> create

or knife that door in order to create

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410 
or knife that door in order to create
another<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.059> building

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
another way to get into this building

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
another way to get into this building
over<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> throughout<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.280> map<00:00:56.550> there

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
over here and throughout this map there

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
over here and throughout this map there
are<00:00:56.850> tons<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> tons<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.750> different<00:00:57.870> doors

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
are tons and tons of different doors

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
are tons and tons of different doors
that<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> either<00:00:59.010> open<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.640> closed

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that you can either open or closed

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
that you can either open or closed
depending<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.600> whether<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.289> open<00:01:01.620> or

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
depending on whether it is open or

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.439 
depending on whether it is open or
closed<00:01:01.920> every<00:01:02.219> door<00:01:02.430> starts<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.940> open<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
closed every door starts out open and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
closed every door starts out open and
then<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.110> buttons<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.100> either<00:01:05.460> side

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
then there are buttons on either side

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.280 
then there are buttons on either side
that<00:01:05.820> allow<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> open<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.600> close<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.960> to

that allow you to open or close them to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
that allow you to open or close them to
be<00:01:07.409> honest<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> wish<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.520> only

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
be honest I kind of wish there was only

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
be honest I kind of wish there was only
one<00:01:09.060> way<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> click<00:01:09.750> them<00:01:09.960> instead<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> having

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
one way to click them instead of having

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.530 
one way to click them instead of having
every<00:01:11.310> single<00:01:11.340> door<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:12.180> buttons

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
every single door have two buttons

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
every single door have two buttons
because<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.290> create<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
because it would create a lot of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
because it would create a lot of
strategy<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> tactics<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.600> terms<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.170> knowing

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
strategy and tactics in terms of knowing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
strategy and tactics in terms of knowing
which<00:01:17.280> doors<00:01:17.640> open<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:19.080> keep<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
which doors open where but just keep in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
which doors open where but just keep in
mind<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.920> open<00:01:20.310> every<00:01:20.820> single<00:01:20.939> door

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
mind that you can open every single door

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
mind that you can open every single door
on<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> map<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.930> any<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
on this map from any side which actually

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.440 
on this map from any side which actually
makes<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> very<00:01:23.610> easy<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.210> able<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
makes it very easy to be able to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
makes it very easy to be able to
navigate<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.020> map<00:01:25.110> however<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> good

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
navigate the map however it is a good

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
navigate the map however it is a good
strategy<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> close<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> doors<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.750> then

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
strategy to close the doors and then

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
strategy to close the doors and then
wait<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.710> someone<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> open<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.430> because

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
wait for someone to open them because

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
wait for someone to open them because
it's<00:01:29.939> pretty<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> free<00:01:30.479> kill<00:01:30.780> if

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's pretty much a free kill if

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
it's pretty much a free kill if
someone's<00:01:31.259> staying<00:01:31.409> nearby<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> door<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
someone's staying nearby the door right

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
someone's staying nearby the door right
after<00:01:32.729> keep<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> mind<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> come<00:01:33.930> over

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
after keep in mind when you come over

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
after keep in mind when you come over
here<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.560> knife<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.920> shoot<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.520> little

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
here you can knife or shoot this little

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
here you can knife or shoot this little
door<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.750> open<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.920> gives<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
door over here open and it gives you a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
door over here open and it gives you a
really<00:01:38.520> nice<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:38.909> underground<00:01:39.299> routes

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really nice little underground routes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.359 
really nice little underground routes
however<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> lot<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> cover<00:01:41.189> when

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
however there's not a lot of cover when

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.319 
however there's not a lot of cover when
you're<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> get

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you're going down here so if you get

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
you're going down here so if you get
into<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> gunfight<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.409> very

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
into a gunfight you're going to be very

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
into a gunfight you're going to be very
exposed<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:45.000> high<00:01:45.180> risk<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
exposed and it's a pretty high risk in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
exposed and it's a pretty high risk in
order<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> try<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> flank

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
order to go down there and try to flank

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
order to go down there and try to flank
people<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.689> also<00:01:48.810> close<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.290> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
people and you can also close out that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
people and you can also close out that
area<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:49.979> lastly<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> last<00:01:50.909> little

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
area over here lastly the last little

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
area over here lastly the last little
dynamic<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.200> ladder<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.619> don't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
dynamic bit is this ladder you don't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
dynamic bit is this ladder you don't
have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.460> blow<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> c4<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.020> did

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
have to blow it up with a c4 like I did

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
have to blow it up with a c4 like I did
you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.799> knife<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.130> shoot<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.520> pretty

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can knife or shoot it I'm pretty

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
you can knife or shoot it I'm pretty
sure<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.420> once<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> come<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.110> there's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
sure but once you come up here there's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
sure but once you come up here there's
some<00:01:58.409> pretty<00:01:58.530> cool<00:01:58.770> things<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.490> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> like

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
some pretty cool things I kind of like

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
some pretty cool things I kind of like
the<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.689> Infinity<00:02:01.259> Ward<00:02:01.530> blocked<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.009> off

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the way Infinity Ward blocked this off

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.740 
the way Infinity Ward blocked this off
so<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> can't<00:02:02.700> necessarily<00:02:02.909> hide<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.719> here

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so you can't necessarily hide up here

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
so you can't necessarily hide up here
and<00:02:04.049> camp<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.530> too<00:02:04.680> long<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.100> you'll<00:02:05.369> be

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and camp for too long because you'll be

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.740 
and camp for too long because you'll be
very<00:02:05.579> exposed<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> try<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
very exposed if you try to do that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.419 
very exposed if you try to do that
however<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.469> come<00:02:07.649> onto<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.890> roof<00:02:08.039> over<00:02:08.190> here

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
however you come onto the roof over here

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
however you come onto the roof over here
they<00:02:08.580> blocked<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> off<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.270> can't<00:02:09.629> walk<00:02:09.959> on

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
they blocked it off so you can't walk on

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.390 
they blocked it off so you can't walk on
top<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.890> outside<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> map

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
top of it and get outside the map

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.010 
top of it and get outside the map
however<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.239> wanted<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> could<00:02:12.810> kind

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
however if you wanted to you could kind

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
however if you wanted to you could kind
of<00:02:13.080> crouch

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
of crouch

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
of crouch
and<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.910> nice<00:02:15.090> little

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
and you know use it as a nice little

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.699 
and you know use it as a nice little
perch<00:02:15.510> over<00:02:15.750> there<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.050> would<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.500> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
this to mantle on top of the Train over
here<00:02:19.950> there's<00:02:20.370> also<00:02:20.519> other<00:02:20.819> ways<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.330> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
just get to the very highest points on

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990 
just get to the very highest points on
that<00:02:25.530> train<00:02:25.769> over<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.340> here's<00:02:26.790> another

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that train over there so here's another

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
strafe to get back to the other side but

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.119
