juice in it to power my Nexus 5 this
that<00:02:27.560> was<00:02:27.739> about<00:02:28.040> 60<00:02:28.550> something<00:02:28.910> percent<00:02:29.360> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
that was about 60 something percent and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.410 
that was about 60 something percent and
when<00:02:30.019> I'm<00:02:30.110> 280<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:31.070> was<00:02:31.250> good<00:02:31.400> enough<00:02:31.610> for<00:02:31.670> me

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.370 

so<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:36.170> only<00:02:36.350> disadvantage<00:02:36.910> about<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
so the only disadvantage about this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.259 
so the only disadvantage about this
portable<00:02:39.380> charger<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.340> takes<00:02:40.580> very

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
portable charger is that it takes very

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.410 
portable charger is that it takes very
very<00:02:41.450> long<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.260> charge<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:43.160> takes<00:02:43.400> about<00:02:43.730> four

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
very long to charge it takes about four

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.520 
very long to charge it takes about four
hours<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:45.290> charge<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:46.489> quite<00:02:47.000> some<00:02:47.269> time

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
hours to charge that's quite some time

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.740 
hours to charge that's quite some time
sometimes<00:02:49.220> I'd<00:02:49.580> use<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.239> little<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
sometimes I'd use it just a little and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.080 
sometimes I'd use it just a little and
you<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.010> take<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> two<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.940> half

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
you have to take like a two and a half

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.720 
you have to take like a two and a half
hours<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> charge<00:02:53.989> that's<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:55.130> lot<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.370> time
