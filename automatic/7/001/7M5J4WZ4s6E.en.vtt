00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.510
 the movie of 9 we already know who is 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.150
 the one with the long tongue 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.150
 Well, the god is located in his first 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.920
 mission of three is located more or less well

 is in it and transport 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.360
 up here where we are now 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.899
 same and well let's talk to him the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.899
 first mission 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.100
 It's worth the only thing that needs to be done 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.150
 do this jumping test although I 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.920
 I always do it with a person from 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.979
 flying but I've never done it with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.979
 archangel let's see how I get 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.370
 the perfect fast the next to what 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.370
 cheat next to be there 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.480
 I am a comet 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 you jump better than a cane 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.150
 Uncle Earth has been placed 129 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.800
 golden gilded bricks and now we're going to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 for the next one you are going to find 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.130
 just someone squeeze pound good 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 we put the map we go up 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.080
 where was the first mission worth 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.680
 we went down this side 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 and we talk to him 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.650
 with another pigeon plus my toad senses 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.870
 I feel almost certain that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.170
 if you jump on all the complaints it will happen 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.119
 Something incredible 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.290
 it's worth the same as before we're going to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.050
 give him cane 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.800
 and this we are going to do by jumping to 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.800
 see how I get 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.259
 the next 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.310
 all of trap I have prefer with ha 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.349
 gone a good because I handle it less in the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.349
 air and you're 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.180
 also jump like the great capo 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.100
 then we unlocked the motorcycle 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 We also want to go to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.510
 buy but 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.140
 first let's go to the third and last 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.390
 mission as we see already just went and it 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.250
 will find that I find it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.450
 it was also on the map I think if I do not 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.020
 I was wrong on the island of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.020
 freedom 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.530
 and freedom if it is indeed there 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.440
 we are going to have to transport ourselves here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.450
 we are talking to him 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.520
 I've seen you jump and I have to recognize 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 that if it gives you very well but you're not toad 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.180
 only when super is my last challenge 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.630
 of jumps is considered the jumper 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.700
 perfect 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.460
 Well, this is a tad more 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.770
 complicated than the other two 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.700
 for this is supposed to be a tad more 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.340
 complicated that the other two is more 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.280
 complicated I'm so it's not the same 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.130
 but 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.910
 a little bit more as I say a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.620
 little bit heavier and we're going to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.620
 jump there the push button 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 yes 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.180

 known as tomato is a supervillain 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.699

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.680
 extraordinary in regards to 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.960
 climb all the jumping walls from 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.860

 unpleasant powers and that is that 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.020
 let's solve 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.370

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.039
 we kept talking this kid and it came out 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.419
 for the first time in a can and x-men 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:54.400
 volume 1 number 4 in March 1964 the 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.610
 first versions of the toad were a lot 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.729
 very similar to a sad creepy 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.520
 magnetto very similar to waters and mode 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.620
 the novel but this version would be used 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.919
 for the first time the x-men movie 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.509
 and new series comic version this 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.849
 kid was born in new york and was 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.849
 abandoned by his childhood parents makes 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.159
 many years in an orphanage where he was 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.399
 constantly tormented by the others 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.740
 children because of their ugliness and the strange 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.899
 body shape 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.240
 his mutant appearance was present 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:30.789
 since his birth he was considered a 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.429
 be mentally inferior because of his 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.469
 extreme shyness and difficulties for the 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:38.610
 learning for elementary school 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.649
 even though he was really smart 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.139
 He left school at a very young age 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:46.869
 early and decided to fend for himself 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.139
 based on years of abuse and 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:52.569
 knowing very well that it was a phenomenon 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.809
 mortimer so it was called developed a 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.459
 severe inferiority complex arriving 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.459
 to make anyone serve him 

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:03.309
 show the slightest effect and already for
