00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:15.360
 today's issue I will show how to be 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 I will show 2 2 bugs and one carpet so here you are 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.480
 understand here is the first bug that when you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 get up 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 so here so then you go out you go to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 the world and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:42.420
 at the top 2 teleport people call the second 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 the bug is this the same as possible 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 sit down oh fell and such here such not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.750
 know oh let's i show how it's done 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 everything is clear there is no concessions 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.189
 but sorry so here we put for example 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.450
 we want to sit under take any block of NATO 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.600
 in a tree it will even succeed 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.080
 push like this this so on no further 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.430
 arrived 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 energetic somehow so called 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:31.200
 rails can now be removed if already on 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:36.270
 it even seems like being on a chair and this 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.869
 so let's see an hour sat on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.869
 construction site 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.159
 labor can say we sit 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:01.770
 and can make it there intermeddle here 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.250
 all everything is clear to anyone can ddr3 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.239
 return the trick how to be painted let's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 I'll show you a little now, but the essence is 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:19.620
 same 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:22.140
 triblock let's take any let's 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.190
 white now take and most importantly it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.710
 take the signs 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:35.600
 it's all made of tablets here we are 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:37.459
 For example, we take here we put it like this 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:48.080
 try 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:48.080
 I tried to do it like this now 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.760
 if you want you can pick up or let's 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.450
 so far i will just show 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 and that is faster and so here we are 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.480
 the carpet turned out 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.480
