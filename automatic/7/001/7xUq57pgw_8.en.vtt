00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.700
Today, Sony's PlayStation 4 is dressed in gloss white to celebrate Destiny's launch, one of the biggest entertainment launches in gaming history. 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:55.500
You are watching the Unboxholics show with your usual host, Sakis Karpas, and this is the White PS4 500GB Destiny Bundle. 

00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:07.020
The White PS4 Destiny Bundle as well as the extra maps, gear, weapons and ships are part of an exclusive deal between Sony and Activision. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.200
Inside the bundle, we found the game's retail box which includes exclusive content for PlayStation fans like maps, weapons, ships and gear.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.750
We leave the manuals aside and immediately notice the DualShock 4 which we'll show you in a bit.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.934
Bundle Contents: 1. AC Power Adapter Cord

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:24.550
2. PS4 in-ear headset

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
3. A USB charger Cable

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.200
4. HDMI Cable

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.400
5. A White PS4

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:47.550
The White DualShock 4 is certainly admirable in a lot of ways, especially for its contrast between white and black colors.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.020
Aside from having a different color, it is not different in terms of design.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:02:09.300
The same applies to the white PlayStation 4. Although it would have been more appropriate to see a Destiny themed PS4 with a Bungie inspired design, Sony chose to play it safe with a simple white color and a blue color for the LED bar. 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:24.050
But let's be pragmatists. If PS4 had launched back in November 2013 in a white color, we would have the same excitement over a black version. The white PS4 is amazingly beautiful but it all comes down to personal taste.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:22.400
The White PS4 Destiny bundle is available now for â‚¬399. Practically, you will be purchasing a White PS4 with Destiny for free since it has the same price as the black bundle. 

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:31.800
If you're interested in this bundle, you should definitely hurry up since this is a limited edition.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:36.750
That's all for now! See you on our website: Unboxholics.com!
