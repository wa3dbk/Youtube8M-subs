00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.490
 today we are going to talk more about 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.460
 microsoft still say because microsoft 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 has changed and with windows in particular 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.790
 has changed its strategy 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.140
 mainly the room drastically 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.300
 regarding the interface 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.550
 graphic that is his style of 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.860
 publication as the interface 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.200
 graphic has become similar if not equal 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.940
 on all devices and attack of 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.670
 unify a single operating system for 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.379
 tablet and pc smartphones 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.780
 but what more than it also has 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.850
 modified is the cadence with which 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.680
 will release and is still modifying the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.360
 cadence with which it will release not 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.220
 updates but really new versions 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.079
 of windows and drastically modified 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.540
 the price indeed as we can see 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.250
 the average price of windows 8 is a lot but 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.680
 much much lower than that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.530
 costs windows 7 which was around 200 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.910
 euro for the professional version 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.759
 today we are going to talk about one 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.840
 news regarding windows 8 that 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.490
 we can call it a system anyway 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.770
 new operating but it is an update 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.899
 which brings improvements to windows 8 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.910
 which will be windows 8.1 and should be 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.220
 released free of charge for all 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:29.350
 windows 8 windows 8.1 users is a bit 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.570
 an update top the problems 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.670
 calais to windows 8 for first thing 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.930
 Microsoft took a step back 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.729
 stepped back as we can 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.369
 see in the video you can see 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.290
 some scenes here also showing us a 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.979
 all the new things it brought 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.200
 microsoft 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.080
 the first news was the introduction of 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 start key from reintroduces start key 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.100
 as users if it is not too much 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 complained of this lack is the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.090
 possibility to start the system 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 operational not directly in a m why but 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.290
 start it directly on the desktop 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.570
 normal that we have always known of 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.399
 windows in 7 views versions 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.590
 other news are important in the metro 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.239
 why that are for example greater 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 customization regarding 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.040
 backgrounds or customization 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.750
 to set the background 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.060
 we have in our normal windows like 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.340
 metro background why customization 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.989
 which was recommended by in fact 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 some tweaks that had been built 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.349
 for windows 8 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.269
 other customizations other novelties 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.030
 have been archiving online with 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.800
 skydrive even more unified 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.500
 within windows 8 and unification 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.500
 even better than windows windows 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.819
 skype which will obviously be more skype 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.269
 unified within the system 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.510
 operational so we will have just one 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.540
 connection in a sense skype e 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.400
 windows will be integrated together in the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 operating system and probably not 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.170
 installation will also be required 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.170
 of sky 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.120
 multitasking has also been improved 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.020
 making applications faster and 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.790
 improving the state of suspension 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.980
 of applications because as well 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.990
 we know I don't know if you know the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.120
 applications go into a state of 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.620
 suspension when we close is a bit 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 like the operation of iphone 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.210
 this except in the applications that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 require for example a streaming e 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.710
 which therefore requires sd that require 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.340
 background action eg skype 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.340
 etc 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 another really important news is 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.879
 was for example the search as it is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.409
 research permitting has been improved 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.090
 a faster display more 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.530
 safe and faster than all 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.170
 applications we are looking for in 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.299
 our windows, however, that made it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.189
 a little skeptical in the presentation that 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.500
 no other changes have been presented 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.569
 as for speed, etc. but 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.159
 yes it is microsoft it has fossilized on 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.379
 graphic interface 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.599
 perhaps the problem the more the problem is that 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.670
 he needed more to solve in this 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.400
 period given the great criticisms that 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 he had also received data 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.099
 not only in the professional field 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.290
 in the consumer sphere 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.970
 See you at the next video I hope 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.930

 put a nice like by clicking on 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.120
 that little key with his hand 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.099
 towards the thumb towards up and 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 obviously if you want to stay up to date 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.610

 all the new information 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.669
