00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
 hank 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.679
 hello how are you happy to say hello again 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.800
 the unfortunate events 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.259
 from a few days ago in kino bay 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.739
 where two young people from Hermosillo lost their lives in a tragic way 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.019
 sends us a message of reflection every year 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860
 so to the whole society in general 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.290
 well, sometimes 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 young people do not measure the consequences of relating alcohol with the steering wheel 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 and what begins as sara diversion 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.489
 I took the risk of concluding 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.399
 in facts 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 that afterwards we regret as a family and as a city 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.260
 in this part insists 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.740
 already on other occasions we have emphasized this topic 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.300
 particularly our state and in hermosillo 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.040
 the consumption of alcohol and other addictions 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 it has increased in young people substantially 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.860
 even until very recently 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.870
 which leads to a similar accident 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.730
 strong economic sanctions have been proposed for those who drive in 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.240
 drunk state 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.230
 but it 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.980
 It will not be an impediment to events such as Bay Kino 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.979
 here the fundamental 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.080
 is that in joint actions that is the government 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.020
 In particular, we parents will address this issue and work with 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.300
 please to make the majority of young people aware 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.050
 about the serious danger that represents 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.140
 relate 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.720
 alcohol with the steering wheel 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.660
 and we are not against the fun of course 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.760
 but to act responsibly on this issue specifically 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.409
 we have examples from other countries where only driving while intoxicated 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.650
 merits jail 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.040
 and derived from it 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.970
 a culture of precaution has developed 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 to such a degree 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560
 that when you access someone in the drink 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 prefer to leave the car in the place do not use a taxi to get to your 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.169
 destination 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.589
 Now another aspect to reflect 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:15.829
 it is the fact 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.829
 that young people have learned from us adults 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.999
 many of his misconduct 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.750
 where maybe in the past 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.259
 the circumstances made the customs 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 for more relaxed in relation to alcoyano 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.149
 the statistics have shown 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.119
 in this time the situation is different 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.469
 and as parents 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.839
 we want to pay special attention to this topic 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:44.229
 and not see how normal our children almir in this situation like 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.389
 inconsequential 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.029
 that is why we must persist 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 the urgency to maintain a permanent information campaign 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.029
 about the inconveniences of driving and taking 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:00.069
 we will insist until the fatigue on the need for parents 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.519
 let's be more conscious 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.609
 of the behaviors of our minor children 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.180
 and we want the authorities to be also more demanding 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.260
 in control through filters 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
 alcohol consumption especially among young people 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.660
 let's avoid then 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.559
 such regrettable events as the referred kid 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.129
 let's all join a great campaign 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.769
 to focus on the search 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.999
 of immediate and medium-term solutions 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:33.599
 where it contemplates a mixture of actions in which the prevention the sanction and the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.339
 responsibility that as a society we should all share 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.089
 let's do it for our children and for ourselves 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.159
 thank you very much take care 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.579
 and not many by next week
