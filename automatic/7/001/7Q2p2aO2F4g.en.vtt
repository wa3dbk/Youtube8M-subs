00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and use a different texture pack this is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.549 
and use a different texture pack this is
yeah<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.489> house<00:00:53.699> yes<00:00:54.149> sir<00:00:54.390> i'll<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.530> and

connect<00:01:05.730> back<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.270> server<00:01:07.970> yeah<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.900> I've

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
connect back to the server yeah so I've

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.870 
connect back to the server yeah so I've
been<00:01:10.500> working<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.190> no<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.700> as

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
been working on this with no back on as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
been working on this with no back on as
you<00:01:12.030> wouldn't<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.570> you've<00:01:12.720> seen<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:13.140> last

with<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.980> particular<00:01:17.400> texture<00:01:17.940> pack<00:01:18.150> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
with this particular texture pack so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.950 
with this particular texture pack so
yeah<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.980> house<00:01:20.670> I'll<00:01:21.450> climb<00:01:21.660> up<00:01:21.810> this

show<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.649> just<00:02:01.649> another<00:02:02.040> texture<00:02:02.460> pack<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
show you just another texture pack that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
show you just another texture pack that
i<00:02:02.940> got<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.420> other<00:02:03.540> day<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.140> called

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
i got the other day that was called

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.749 
i got the other day that was called
x-ray<00:02:05.399> texture<00:02:06.119> pack<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.860> easier<00:02:08.040> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
x-ray texture pack it's a lot easier to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.570 
x-ray texture pack it's a lot easier to
find<00:02:09.269> diamonds<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.110> coal<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.100> sorts<00:02:11.519> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
find diamonds and coal and all sorts of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.550 
find diamonds and coal and all sorts of
stuff<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:12.090> little<00:02:12.720> cave<00:02:13.049> systems<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.239> as

so<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.880> got<00:03:06.060> x-ray<00:03:06.360> vision<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:09.079> so

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
so you got x-ray vision kind of thing so

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.720 
so you got x-ray vision kind of thing so
yeah<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:12.480> works<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.290> multiplayer<00:03:14.099> as<00:03:14.400> well<00:03:14.580> as

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730
