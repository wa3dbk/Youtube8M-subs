for<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.140> second<00:00:25.500> for<00:00:25.680> five<00:00:25.830> seconds<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
for every second for five seconds the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.240 
for every second for five seconds the
area<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.080> roughly<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> lot<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.949> say<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
area of this is roughly a lot to say the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
area of this is roughly a lot to say the
size<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> circle<00:00:30.029> around<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
size of the circle around me if that you

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
size of the circle around me if that you
can<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.579> mind<00:00:32.730> around<00:00:32.790> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
can kind of get your mind around that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
can kind of get your mind around that
there's<00:00:33.660> roughly<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> same<00:00:34.200> size<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there's roughly the same size of this so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280 
there's roughly the same size of this so
it's<00:00:34.950> pretty<00:00:35.130> good<00:00:35.690> it's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's pretty good it's a good like I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
it's pretty good it's a good like I
things<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.070> ER<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.870> all

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
things like it like ER just so all

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
things like it like ER just so all
ranching<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.680> lightning<00:00:40.920> damage<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.430> any

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
ranching it is lightning damage so any

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
ranching it is lightning damage so any
let<00:00:41.910> any<00:00:42.000> percentage<00:00:42.360> damage<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.899> stack<00:00:43.230> will

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
let any percentage damage you stack will

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
let any percentage damage you stack will
also<00:00:43.770> increase<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> damage<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
also increase the damage of this and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.209 
also increase the damage of this and
this<00:00:45.570> weekend<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.110> tix<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.530> me<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.860> average

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this weekend this tix for me on average

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
this weekend this tix for me on average
about<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.579> million<00:00:47.760> three<00:00:47.940> million<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.829> only

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
about two million three million the only

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.459 
about two million three million the only
Thunder<00:00:50.129> gods<00:00:50.460> vigor<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> does

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
Thunder gods vigor because it does

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.600 
Thunder gods vigor because it does
better<00:00:52.469> Danvers<00:00:52.829> everyone<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
better Danvers everyone I think it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
better Danvers everyone I think it's
like<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> hundred<00:00:53.969> fifty<00:00:54.239> percent<00:00:54.510> normally<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
like a hundred fifty percent normally I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
like a hundred fifty percent normally I
can't<00:00:55.649> remember<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> lightning<00:00:56.789> damage

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
can't remember but is lightning damage

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
can't remember but is lightning damage
it<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.539> deal<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> increased<00:00:59.160> by

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it you do deal it so it is increased by

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.209 
it you do deal it so it is increased by
the<00:00:59.430> lightning<00:01:00.059> skills<00:01:00.680> damage<00:01:01.680> off<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> your

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the lightning skills damage off of your

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.890 
the lightning skills damage off of your
um<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:03.270> razors<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.719> whatnot<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.869> of

um your razors and whatnot the is off of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.399 
um your razors and whatnot the is off of
chance<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.990> sures<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
chance of so it was for sures I'm a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.070 
chance of so it was for sures I'm a
chance<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.220> sure<00:01:11.250> off<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.760> dodge

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
chance to for sure off of your dodge

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
chance to for sure off of your dodge
your<00:01:13.080> block<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.880> gain<00:01:15.090> hit<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
your block and you actually gain hit it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.060 
your block and you actually gain hit it
will<00:01:15.659> always<00:01:16.049> happen<00:01:16.320> i'm<00:01:16.590> pretty<00:01:16.860> sure<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
will always happen i'm pretty sure the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
will always happen i'm pretty sure the
radius<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.610> pretty<00:01:17.820> big<00:01:18.000> too<00:01:19.100> besides

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
radius if it's pretty big too besides

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
radius if it's pretty big too besides
those<00:01:20.490> you'll<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.180> trying<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.570> Volker

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
those you'll be trying to get Volker

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
those you'll be trying to get Volker
since<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> set<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.460> demons<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> set

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
since to set and the demons is to set

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.270 
since to set and the demons is to set
because<00:01:25.350> Booker's<00:01:25.799> gives<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.670> 4k<00:01:27.150> damage

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
because Booker's gives you 4k damage

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.530 
because Booker's gives you 4k damage
which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> pretty<00:01:29.640> nice<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> could<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.420> for

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
which is pretty nice so you could go for

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.990 
which is pretty nice so you could go for
the<00:01:30.600> whole<00:01:30.780> six<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.439> five<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the whole six up to five if you want to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.620 
the whole six up to five if you want to
it's<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> iffy<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's kind of iffy on you can do the it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's kind of iffy on you can do the it
be<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.470> big<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> area<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.310> 15<00:01:38.640> yard

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

me<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.619> differently<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.520> also<00:01:53.670> allows<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
me and it differently it also allows you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.740

to grab more legendary passes instead of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
to grab more legendary passes instead of
