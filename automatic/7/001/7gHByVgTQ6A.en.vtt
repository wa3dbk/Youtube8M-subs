when<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.450> look<00:00:12.630> at<00:00:12.780> moving<00:00:13.710> forward<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
when we look at moving forward the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.640 
when we look at moving forward the
forward<00:00:14.940> march<00:00:15.330> technique<00:00:15.809> has<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> couple<00:00:16.470> key

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
forward march technique has a couple key

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.840 
forward march technique has a couple key
elements<00:00:17.070> number<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.510> toes<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.850> wire

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
elements number one the toes are up wire

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.019 
elements number one the toes are up wire
the<00:00:21.119> toes<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.859> really<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.430> keeps<00:00:23.640> us<00:00:23.789> from

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the toes up really it just keeps us from

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.779 
the toes up really it just keeps us from
tripping<00:00:24.570> over<00:00:24.990> our<00:00:25.109> feet<00:00:25.350> especially<00:00:25.980> when

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
tripping over our feet especially when

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
tripping over our feet especially when
you're<00:00:26.939> carrying<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> heavy<00:00:27.330> bass<00:00:27.689> drum<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
you're carrying a heavy bass drum or a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
you're carrying a heavy bass drum or a
heavy<00:00:28.949> set<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> tenors<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.359> end<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
heavy set of tenors at the end of the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
heavy set of tenors at the end of the
day<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.380> player<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.800> become<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.369> fatigued

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
day the player can become very fatigued

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.450 
day the player can become very fatigued
and<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> relaxed<00:00:34.320> style<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.010> marching

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and with a relaxed style of marching

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
and with a relaxed style of marching
that<00:00:35.910> toe<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.570> down<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> they'll

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that toe can go down first and they'll

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
that toe can go down first and they'll
trip<00:00:37.890> over<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> instrument<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.000> injured

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
trip over the instrument and get injured

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
trip over the instrument and get injured
so<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:40.500> important<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> maintain

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
so it's really important to maintain

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.720 
so it's really important to maintain
that<00:00:41.879> toe<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.329> style<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.079> well<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that toe up style as well you want to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
that toe up style as well you want to
maintain<00:00:44.879> good<00:00:45.450> posture<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.440> upper

upper body is going to allow your lower
body<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.379> move<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.770> freely<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
body to move more freely that's where a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
body to move more freely that's where a
good<00:00:55.500> physical<00:00:56.399> workout<00:00:56.600> routine<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> key<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
good physical workout routine is key to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.229 
good physical workout routine is key to
movement<00:00:59.550> a<00:01:00.109> solid<00:01:01.109> core<00:01:01.609> allows<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> hold

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
movement a solid core allows you to hold

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.179 
movement a solid core allows you to hold
the<00:01:03.510> drums<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.290> upper<00:01:04.530> body<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the drums with your upper body your

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
the drums with your upper body your
shoulders<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.510> ease<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
shoulders are going to have more ease in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
shoulders are going to have more ease in
supporting<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> harness<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.970> middle<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
supporting the harness and the middle of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
supporting the harness and the middle of
your<00:01:09.420> body<00:01:09.799> supports<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> weight<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.760> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
your body supports the weight not your

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
your body supports the weight not your
lower<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:13.189> with<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> forward<00:01:14.700> march<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lower back as with the forward march the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
lower back as with the forward march the
backward<00:01:15.810> march<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.890> key<00:01:17.189> element<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
backward march has one key element the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.899 
backward march has one key element the
heel<00:01:18.450> must<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.830> moving<00:01:20.100> backward

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.080 

why<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.900> important<00:01:24.530> if<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.520> heel<00:01:25.759> goes

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
why is this important if the heel goes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.840 
why is this important if the heel goes
down<00:01:26.479> all<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.799> weight<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.280> instrument

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
down all of the weight of the instrument

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.880 
down all of the weight of the instrument
and<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.210> momentum<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> body<00:01:30.170> would

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
and the momentum of the body would

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.190 
and the momentum of the body would
propel<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.520> backwards<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.720> probably

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
propel you backwards and is probably

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.380 
propel you backwards and is probably
going<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.440> cause<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.830> fall<00:01:34.159> make<00:01:35.060> sure

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
going to cause you to fall make sure

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.510 
going to cause you to fall make sure
that<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.869> control<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.649> angle<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.250> drums

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
that you control the angle of the drums

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.639 
that you control the angle of the drums
take<00:01:37.909> note<00:01:38.180> of<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.540> as<00:01:38.720> you're<00:01:39.350> moving

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
take note of that as you're moving

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.530 
take note of that as you're moving
backwards<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.549> want<00:01:40.670> those<00:01:40.909> drums<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.360> be<00:01:41.479> in

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
backwards you want those drums to be in

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.469 
backwards you want those drums to be in
a<00:01:41.630> flat<00:01:41.869> position<00:01:42.170> if<00:01:42.680> they<00:01:43.430> tilt<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:43.970> that's

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
a flat position if they tilt back that's

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.109 
a flat position if they tilt back that's
going<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.750> be<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.899> key<00:01:45.200> factor<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.890> good<00:01:46.460> warning

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
going to be a key factor a good warning

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.510 
going to be a key factor a good warning
sign<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.840> you're<00:01:47.960> leaning<00:01:48.200> back<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.830> you've

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
sign that you're leaning back and you've

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
sign that you're leaning back and you've
got<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.880> improper<00:01:50.360> technique

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660 

this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.210> exercise<00:02:03.590> 8<00:02:04.590> steps<00:02:05.009> forward<00:02:05.430> 8
