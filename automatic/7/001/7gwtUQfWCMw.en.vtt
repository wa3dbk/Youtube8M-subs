don't know I can't guarantee this gonna
work<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:00.960> um<00:02:01.369> when<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> started<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
work for you but um when I started that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.870 
work for you but um when I started that
I<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.329> 543<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.079> today<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> 514<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I was at 543 and today I'm in a 514 so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960 
I was at 543 and today I'm in a 514 so
I'm<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:06.509> good<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.869> math<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.110> that's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
I'm not very good at math but that's

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.760 
I'm not very good at math but that's
well<00:02:09.970> let's<00:02:10.179> see<00:02:12.270> 543<00:02:13.300> -<00:02:14.910> 514<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:17.170> 29

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
well let's see 543 - 514 that's 29

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.059 
well let's see 543 - 514 that's 29
pounds<00:02:18.340> in<00:02:18.550> 12<00:02:19.239> weeks<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.620> if<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.800> divide<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
pounds in 12 weeks so if you divide that

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.670 
pounds in 12 weeks so if you divide that
up<00:02:21.370> by<00:02:21.580> weeks<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.690> not<00:02:22.840> even<00:02:23.050> been<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> full<00:02:23.260> 12

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
up by weeks it's not even been a full 12

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.830 
up by weeks it's not even been a full 12
weeks<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.069> if<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> divide<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.120> 2.4

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
weeks but if you divide that up it's 2.4

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
weeks but if you divide that up it's 2.4
pounds<00:02:27.690> 2.4<00:02:28.690> pounds<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.290> week<00:02:29.920> which<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> nice

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
pounds 2.4 pounds a week which is a nice

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.600 
pounds 2.4 pounds a week which is a nice
healthy<00:02:31.360> rate<00:02:31.860> not<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:33.010> nice<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.310> I'd

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
healthy rate not as nice as I'd

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.080 
healthy rate not as nice as I'd
necessarily<00:02:33.819> like<00:02:34.300> but<00:02:34.769> certainly<00:02:35.790> doable<00:02:36.790> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
necessarily like but certainly doable is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.670 
necessarily like but certainly doable is
specifically<00:02:37.989> because<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.319> don't<00:02:38.470> feel<00:02:38.560> like

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
specifically because I don't feel like

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.290 
specifically because I don't feel like
I'm<00:02:38.769> starving<00:02:39.069> myself<00:02:39.340> I'm<00:02:39.940> still<00:02:40.150> eating

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
pleased but the fact that the last time

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.170
