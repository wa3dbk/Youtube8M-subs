I<00:01:56.460> agree<00:01:57.420> Joey<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.869> does<00:01:58.079> seem<00:01:58.319> weird<00:01:58.560> because

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I agree Joey it does seem weird because

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
I agree Joey it does seem weird because
almonds<00:01:59.399> when<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> grind<00:01:59.939> them<00:02:00.179> up<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.869> will

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
almonds when you grind them up they will

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.889 
almonds when you grind them up they will
go<00:02:01.439> off<00:02:01.740> unless<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:03.450> through<00:02:03.479> an

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
go off unless they are put through an

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
go off unless they are put through an
ultra-high<00:02:04.560> temperature<00:02:05.299> pasteurization

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
ultra-high temperature pasteurization

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930 
ultra-high temperature pasteurization
which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.959> called<00:02:07.170> UHT<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.340> heated<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
which is called UHT so it's heated to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.710 
which is called UHT so it's heated to
above<00:02:09.479> 280<00:02:10.470> degrees<00:02:10.760> Fahrenheit<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.060> then

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
above 280 degrees Fahrenheit and then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080 
above 280 degrees Fahrenheit and then
that<00:02:13.079> makes<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.650> milk<00:02:13.920> last<00:02:14.430> longer<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that makes the milk last longer on the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
that makes the milk last longer on the
shelf<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.900> vacuum<00:02:16.349> sealed<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
shelf and it's like vacuum sealed so

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.319 
shelf and it's like vacuum sealed so
it's<00:02:17.130> always<00:02:17.250> best<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> fresh<00:02:18.090> one

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
it's always best to get the fresh one

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's always best to get the fresh one
but<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.630> can't<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.290> definitely<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.980> for

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
but if you can't then definitely go for

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.430 
but if you can't then definitely go for
the<00:02:20.220> UHT<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:21.959> being

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the UHT but if you're really being

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.860 
the UHT but if you're really being
ambitious<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.579> can<00:02:23.790> try<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.360> your<00:02:24.660> own

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
ambitious you can try and make your own
