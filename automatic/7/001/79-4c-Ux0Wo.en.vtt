it was a bit like especially comfort
wise<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> felt<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.700> he<00:01:17.700> unless<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
wise and I felt like he unless you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.360 
wise and I felt like he unless you
strung<00:01:18.480> it<00:01:18.660> at<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> low<00:01:19.200> low<00:01:19.410> tension<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.100> low

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370

off<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:29.550> that<00:01:29.700> low<00:01:29.910> tension<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
off it but also at that low tension I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.210 
off it but also at that low tension I
felt<00:01:31.080> like<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> lost<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:31.890> control

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
felt like I lost a little bit of control

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
felt like I lost a little bit of control
as<00:01:32.490> well

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
as well

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.060

rpm<00:01:34.470> lost<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:35.480> have<00:01:36.480> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.140> stiff<00:01:37.560> feel

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
rpm lost does have kind of a stiff feel

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.000 
rpm lost does have kind of a stiff feel
to<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.660> this<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.720> okay<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.260> you<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.650> any<00:01:40.800> arm

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.500 
still performing really well so I was
pretty<00:02:38.360> impressed<00:02:38.540> about<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.130> also<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
pretty impressed about that and also the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
pretty impressed about that and also the
ability<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:42.850> keep<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.060> lot<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.720> control<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
ability to keep a lot of the control and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.780 
ability to keep a lot of the control and
power<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> string<00:02:47.959> intact<00:02:48.770> in<00:02:49.010> contact<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
power of the string intact in contact so

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
power of the string intact in contact so
no<00:02:50.510> turning<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.050> hard<00:02:51.260> serve<00:02:51.590> or<00:02:52.239> if<00:02:53.239> you're<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
no turning the hard serve or if you're a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430 
no turning the hard serve or if you're a
hard<00:02:55.310> floor<00:02:55.640> hand<00:02:56.050> against<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.080> hard<00:02:57.260> floor

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
hard floor hand against a hard floor

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.100 
hard floor hand against a hard floor
near<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.940> black<00:02:58.940> magic<00:02:59.150> seem<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.720> be<00:02:59.840> able<00:02:59.930> to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
near the black magic seem to be able to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.860 
near the black magic seem to be able to
hold<00:03:00.500> its<00:03:00.680> ground<00:03:00.770> pretty<00:03:01.610> well<00:03:01.790> whereas<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
hold its ground pretty well whereas the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.850 
hold its ground pretty well whereas the
awesome<00:03:03.290> blast

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
awesome blast

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.250 
awesome blast
I<00:03:03.920> mean<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.459> would<00:03:04.880> cut<00:03:05.180> through<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.840> ball<00:03:06.050> a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
I mean it would cut through the ball a

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.610 
I mean it would cut through the ball a
bit<00:03:06.500> more<00:03:06.709> but

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
bit more but

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.979 
bit more but
it<00:03:09.370> was<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.520> little<00:03:09.730> bit<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.239> volatile<00:03:10.810> in

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
it was a little bit more volatile in

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.140 
it was a little bit more volatile in
terms<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.380> what<00:03:11.739> sort<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.130> result<00:03:12.580> was

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
terms of what sort of result was

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.120 
terms of what sort of result was
generated<00:03:13.660> sometimes<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.170> get<00:03:14.349> great<00:03:14.739> spin

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
generated sometimes you get great spin

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.010 
generated sometimes you get great spin
but<00:03:15.819> under<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> times<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.720> reading<00:03:16.959> in

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
but under the times and reading in

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.780 
but under the times and reading in
defensive<00:03:17.500> shot<00:03:17.680> we're<00:03:18.250> trying<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.520> get<00:03:18.610> that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
defensive shot we're trying to get that

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.120 
defensive shot we're trying to get that
kind<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> touch<00:03:19.330> shot<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:20.110> would<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:21.010> know

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
kind of a touch shot it would you know

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.259 
kind of a touch shot it would you know
lose<00:03:21.400> its<00:03:21.610> feel<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:23.459> felt<00:03:24.459> like<00:03:24.520> overall<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
lose its feel so I felt like overall the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.990 
lose its feel so I felt like overall the
general<00:03:25.930> strength<00:03:26.890> point<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.190> EEP<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.819> black

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
general strength point of EEP the black

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.630 
general strength point of EEP the black
magic<00:03:28.390> was<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> better<00:03:28.750> value<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.290> also<00:03:29.769> better

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
magic was a better value and also better

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.030 
magic was a better value and also better
performing<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.300> around<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.800> top

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
performing all around for the top

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.390 
performing all around for the top
spinners<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.610> there<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:35.769> able<00:03:36.220> to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
spinners out there if you're able to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.979 
spinners out there if you're able to
afford<00:03:36.730> an<00:03:37.000> Australian<00:03:37.390> rock<00:03:37.510> every<00:03:37.810> two

afford an Australian rock every two

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.190 
afford an Australian rock every two
weeks<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:38.849> maybe<00:03:39.849> rpm<00:03:40.330> bosses<00:03:40.690> rent<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.080> for

from justice and tried them out I tried

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.420 
from justice and tried them out I tried
both<00:03:51.819> them<00:03:52.000> out<00:03:52.150> but<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.950> might<00:03:53.950> find<00:03:53.980> that

both them out but you might find that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.370 
both them out but you might find that
they're<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.450> fairly<00:03:55.750> similar<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:57.239> price-wise

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
they're a fairly similar but price-wise

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.930 
they're a fairly similar but price-wise
there's<00:03:59.380> there's<00:03:59.799> big<00:04:00.010> gaps
