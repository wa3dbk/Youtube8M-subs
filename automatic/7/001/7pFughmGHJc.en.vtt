video<00:00:43.649> player<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> time<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
video player and this time is gonna be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.100 
video player and this time is gonna be
an<00:00:45.539> iPhone<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.289> my<00:00:47.129> PSP<00:00:47.969> screen<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.750> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
an iPhone because my PSP screen is not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.069 
an iPhone because my PSP screen is not
riding<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.809> florescent<00:00:51.809> lighting

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
riding up in this florescent lighting

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.150 
riding up in this florescent lighting
condition<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.930> third<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.920> pane

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
condition and the third one is the pane

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.099 
condition and the third one is the pane
of<00:00:56.190> glass<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.859> here's<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.079> okay

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of glass and here's how you make it okay

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.820 
of glass and here's how you make it okay
so<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.809> box<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so first we're gonna put the box at the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450 
so first we're gonna put the box at the
edge<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> bag<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.140> then<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
edge of the bag and then I will put a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.510 
edge of the bag and then I will put a
pillow<00:01:08.880> over<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.799> glass<00:01:11.159> panes

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pillow over here and my glass panes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
pillow over here and my glass panes
which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.760> I've<00:01:15.270> created<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
which is like this so now I've created a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.320 
which is like this so now I've created a
stage<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.810> call<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> stage<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.979> my

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
stage I call it the stage because my

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.859 
stage I call it the stage because my
virtual<00:01:21.330> robot<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.920> gonna<00:01:23.700> stand<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
virtual robot or is gonna stand on the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.140 
virtual robot or is gonna stand on the
stage<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.130> box<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.979> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
stage on the box and as you can see the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
stage on the box and as you can see the
class<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.820> um<00:01:32.960> dackel<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:35.310> diagonal

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
class is um dackel in a diagonal

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.499 
class is um dackel in a diagonal
position<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:39.240> will

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
position to the back and that will

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.530 
position to the back and that will
ensure<00:01:39.829> my<00:01:41.780> reflection<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.860> phone<00:01:44.100> screen

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
ensure my reflection of the phone screen

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
ensure my reflection of the phone screen
to<00:01:45.540> stand<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.369> box

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to stand right on the box

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.389 
to stand right on the box

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and a pillow to make a diagonal also and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.899 
and a pillow to make a diagonal also and
now<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.240> turn<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.990> view<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.829> put<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
now I'm gonna turn on my view and put it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
now I'm gonna turn on my view and put it
right<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.759> gonna<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.290> a
