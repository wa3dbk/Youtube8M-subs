00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 today I come to launch an important 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.910
 reflection of the gifts that are made in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.700
 Christmas holidays is indeed very 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 common that the vast majority of the family 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.220
 so give gifts to each other and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 gifts that most of the time neither 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 you need neither show that that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 person loves you is done as if it were 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.800
 a kind of materialistic tradition 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 of capitalism basically if you do not 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 you give nothing to that person for kings the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.730
 another can understand that you do not love him 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 enough let's say that that relationship that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 that logic is something that I can not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.250
 understand you do not need to give away anything 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.920
 material to a person that you want to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.410
 show that you want it enough that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 Give her a hug with which you say something 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.660
 very nice or give him a letter or say 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 some heart give some heart 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.000
 because the typical little gifts that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 they make colonies 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.220
 a little bit of clothes things that the other 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 person does not need then then at the end and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.200
 finally they are forgotten in the closet 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.240
 gifts from countries that good countries where 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.910
 people live and have money to spare 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 to walk around giving away things I have always 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.610
 said that Christmas is a big business 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.160
 and that's why a product now good 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.980
 a brand has created a new product 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.250
 called nothing is basically about 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.670
 a box in which there is nothing inside and 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.980
 the gift consists basically in that the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.410
 intention of creation is indeed good 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.080
 this type of box to whom I gave it 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.960
 try to prove that the material is not 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.490
 important however I'm sure 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.650
 that if any of you or of 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.150
 you give this box some 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.670
 family 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.340
 I would end up with the balls of you 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.020
 because society is like that, there's 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.870
 recognize that the vast majority of 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.320
 people of this society can not live 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.210
 without that materialism without those gifts of 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.360
 Christmas without those birthday gifts 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.790
 the case is to give away material things that 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.900
 enrich the most powerful companies 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.820
 and impoverish the poorest people 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 a very convenient tradition for the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 capitalism and good is simply 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.640
 I wanted to launch a reflection about 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.400
 this new product that has made me 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.220
 think a little about if you really 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.490
 all those gifts that give us the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.260
 we really need to prove something or 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.260
 They are gifts to get out of
