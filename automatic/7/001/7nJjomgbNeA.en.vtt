blow<00:04:01.630> up<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.280> minor<00:04:04.030> clips<00:04:04.240> aren't<00:04:04.420> that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.630 
blow up so the minor clips aren't that
really<00:04:04.570> important<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:05.410> if<00:04:06.310> live<00:04:06.520> with

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
really important but if live with

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.670 
really important but if live with
momentum<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.480> feel<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.170> this<00:04:08.380> will<00:04:08.470> come<00:04:08.650> in

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
momentum I feel like this will come in

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.630 
momentum I feel like this will come in
handy<00:04:10.440> basically<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.710> you<00:04:12.040> can<00:04:12.220> blink

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
handy basically you can you can blink

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.570 
handy basically you can you can blink
backwards<00:04:13.330> because<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:14.680> won't<00:04:14.920> teleport<00:04:15.460> you

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
backwards because it won't teleport you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580 
backwards because it won't teleport you
in<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.790> direction<00:04:16.000> you're<00:04:16.480> moving<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:17.530> will

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
in the direction you're moving it will

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.810 
in the direction you're moving it will
teleport<00:04:17.920> you<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.310> direction<00:04:18.459> you're

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.080 
teleport you in the direction you're
facing<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:20.799> feel<00:04:21.549> like<00:04:21.580> that'll<00:04:21.910> come<00:04:22.060> in

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
facing and I feel like that'll come in

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.080 
facing and I feel like that'll come in
handy<00:04:22.210> one<00:04:22.600> day<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.990> have<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> glyph<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.610> rapid

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.660 
handy one day I have a glyph of rapid
teleportation<00:04:25.840> not<00:04:26.560> not<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.130> big<00:04:27.310> plus

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
teleportation not not really a big plus

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.760 
teleportation not not really a big plus
but<00:04:27.970> when<00:04:28.240> you're<00:04:28.390> teleporting<00:04:29.290> airport<00:04:29.680> in

some places you have to run out of the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.030 
some places you have to run out of the
place<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.730> teleport<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.470> its<00:04:35.470> amount<00:04:35.710> I

place the teleport you to its amount I

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.890 
place the teleport you to its amount I
mean<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.000> can<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.150> get<00:04:37.360> there<00:04:37.480> quicker<00:04:37.720> with

this not not a big plus glyph of
illusion<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.050> really<00:04:41.350> cool

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
illusion I think this is really cool

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.590 
illusion I think this is really cool
that<00:04:42.070> they<00:04:42.250> implemented<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.030> in<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.300> game

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
that they implemented this in the game

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.530 
that they implemented this in the game
it<00:04:44.380> trims<00:04:44.710> transforms<00:04:45.610> mage<00:04:45.910> look<00:04:46.300> like

just<00:06:12.340> imagine<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:12.970> a<00:06:13.030> BG<00:06:16.770> so<00:06:17.770> let<00:06:17.920> me<00:06:17.950> just

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
just imagine it in a BG so let me just

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.940 
just imagine it in a BG so let me just
thought<00:06:18.420> let<00:06:19.420> me<00:06:19.510> just<00:06:19.690> break<00:06:20.260> that<00:06:20.440> down<00:06:20.620> for

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
thought let me just break that down for

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:27.110 
thought let me just break that down for
you<00:06:21.340> guys<00:06:22.260> so<00:06:23.260> I<00:06:23.590> first<00:06:24.510> put<00:06:25.510> a<00:06:25.540> frost<00:06:25.840> bomb<00:06:26.110> on

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
you guys so I first put a frost bomb on

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.550 
you guys so I first put a frost bomb on
lift<00:06:28.120> that<00:06:28.240> tick<00:06:28.600> and<00:06:28.930> then<00:06:29.080> put<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.230> ring<00:06:29.440> of

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
lift that tick and then put a ring of

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.880 
lift that tick and then put a ring of
frost<00:06:30.780> that<00:06:31.780> missile<00:06:32.050> deep<00:06:32.200> freeze<00:06:32.470> all<00:06:32.770> the

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
frost that missile deep freeze all the

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.640 
frost that missile deep freeze all the
targets<00:06:33.100> nearby<00:06:33.610> that<00:06:34.570> frost<00:06:34.840> bomb<00:06:35.050> ticks<00:06:35.410> for

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
targets nearby that frost bomb ticks for

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.490 
targets nearby that frost bomb ticks for
30k<00:06:36.480> put<00:06:37.480> another<00:06:37.570> one<00:06:37.900> on<00:06:38.880> frostwire<00:06:39.880> tick

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
30k put another one on frostwire tick

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.710 
30k put another one on frostwire tick
tock<00:06:41.500> pitzer<00:06:42.160> 50k<00:06:43.380> so<00:06:44.380> basically<00:06:45.690> you<00:06:46.690> just

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
tock pitzer 50k so basically you just

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.780 
tock pitzer 50k so basically you just
want<00:06:47.080> to<00:06:47.470> have<00:06:47.680> frost<00:06:48.070> on<00:06:48.310> my<00:06:48.340> own<00:06:48.580> all<00:06:48.670> the

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
want to have frost on my own all the

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.090 
want to have frost on my own all the
time<00:06:48.970> and<00:06:49.300> you<00:06:49.360> want<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:49.930> keep<00:06:50.050> targets<00:06:50.650> frozen

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
time and you want to keep targets frozen

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.250 
time and you want to keep targets frozen
because<00:06:52.090> when<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:52.390> takes<00:06:52.720> it<00:06:52.900> takes<00:06:53.020> for<00:06:53.230> a

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
because when that takes it takes for a

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.840 
because when that takes it takes for a
lot<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:55.260> if<00:06:56.260> you<00:06:56.410> want<00:06:56.560> to<00:06:56.620> do<00:06:56.680> a<00:06:56.710> mess<00:06:57.010> i'm<00:06:57.670> at

ridgid<00:07:31.990> Iceland's<00:07:32.500> proc<00:07:32.740> and<00:07:33.340> if<00:07:33.669> you<00:07:33.759> get<00:07:33.879> the

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
frost firebolt proc that's great because

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.770 
frost firebolt proc that's great because
it<00:07:36.189> crits<00:07:36.729> every<00:07:37.000> time<00:07:37.180> I<00:07:37.210> haven't<00:07:37.449> seen<00:07:37.629> it

it crits every time I haven't seen it
not<00:07:37.930> cret<00:07:38.909> so<00:07:39.909> yeah<00:07:40.120> I<00:07:40.150> guess<00:07:41.340> that's

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:42.340 
not cret so yeah I guess that's

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.779 
not cret so yeah I guess that's
basically<00:07:42.759> it<00:07:44.219> like<00:07:45.219> the<00:07:45.340> video<00:07:45.550> if<00:07:45.610> you

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:45.789 
basically it like the video if you

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.999 
basically it like the video if you
