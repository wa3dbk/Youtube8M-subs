I'm<00:00:12.080> going<00:00:12.350> to<00:00:12.440> demonstrate<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:13.250> traditional

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
I'm going to demonstrate a traditional

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 
I'm going to demonstrate a traditional
locket<00:00:14.420> with<00:00:14.750> three<00:00:14.959> simple<00:00:15.200> folds<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:15.860> we'll

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
locket with three simple folds and we'll

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.460 
locket with three simple folds and we'll
create<00:00:16.160> 55<00:00:16.850> layers<00:00:17.180> in<00:00:17.570> a<00:00:17.660> laminated<00:00:18.290> dough

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
create 55 layers in a laminated dough

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.280 
create 55 layers in a laminated dough
today<00:00:19.040> we're<00:00:19.310> using<00:00:19.610> the<00:00:19.880> 25%<00:00:20.480> home.we

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
today we're using the 25% home.we

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.920 
today we're using the 25% home.we
laminated<00:00:22.130> dough<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:23.330> laminate

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
laminated dough so you laminate

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.779 
laminated dough so you laminate
effectively<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:24.770> need<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:25.100> make<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:25.490> dough

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
effectively we need to make this dough

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.300 
effectively we need to make this dough
twice<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.510> size<00:00:26.689> in<00:00:27.140> one<00:00:27.350> direction<00:00:27.529> of<00:00:28.160> the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
twice the size in one direction of the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.670 
twice the size in one direction of the
butter<00:00:28.550> clocks<00:00:28.820> or<00:00:29.119> compare<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.350> can<00:00:30.500> see

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
butter clocks or compare and I can see

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.130 
butter clocks or compare and I can see
that<00:00:30.890> I'm<00:00:31.010> pretty<00:00:31.220> much<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:32.330> same<00:00:32.540> here<00:00:32.840> but<00:00:33.019> I

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
that I'm pretty much the same here but I

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.130 
that I'm pretty much the same here but I
want<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.379> make<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.800> same<00:00:33.980> size<00:00:34.040> here<00:00:35.140> for

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
want to make it the same size here for

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.380 
want to make it the same size here for
the<00:00:36.980> butter<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.340> line<00:00:37.670> up<00:00:37.879> with<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.210> dough

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the butter to line up with the dough

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.100 
the butter to line up with the dough
like<00:00:38.629> this

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
like this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
like this
so<00:00:39.980> extend<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:40.670> using<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.150> sheeter

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.060 

it's<00:00:56.130> a<00:00:56.190> good<00:00:56.400> fit<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.970> now<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.230> always<00:00:58.830> have<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it's a good fit so now you always have a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's a good fit so now you always have a
slightly<00:00:59.490> smaller<00:00:59.970> because<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:00.930> logos

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
slightly smaller because when the logos

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.620 
slightly smaller because when the logos
who<00:01:01.500> elongates<00:01:02.130> this<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:03.060> compression

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
who elongates this way the compression

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.299 
who elongates this way the compression
will<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> dough<00:01:04.620> slightly<00:01:04.920> longer

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
will also make the dough slightly longer

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.020 
will also make the dough slightly longer
this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.580 

now<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.090> have<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> butter<00:01:13.750> block<00:01:13.990> centered<00:01:14.440> in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
now we have a butter block centered in

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.450 
now we have a butter block centered in
the<00:01:14.710> dome<00:01:14.920> we'll<00:01:15.580> fold<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.210> each<00:01:16.690> side<00:01:20.460> seal

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the dome we'll fold it in each side seal

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.300 
the dome we'll fold it in each side seal
it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.850 

and<00:01:24.790> begin<00:01:25.119> extending<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.049> want<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.680> make

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
and begin extending it I want to make

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830 
and begin extending it I want to make
the<00:01:26.979> dough<00:01:27.159> about<00:01:27.400> 12<00:01:27.729> or<00:01:27.880> 13<00:01:27.909> inches<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:28.690> this

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
the dough about 12 or 13 inches in this

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.020 
the dough about 12 or 13 inches in this
direction<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:29.799> I<00:01:29.830> will<00:01:30.070> rotate<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.670> 90

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
direction and then I will rotate it 90

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
direction and then I will rotate it 90
degrees<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.600> elongate

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.930 

so<00:01:56.500> now<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.010> dough<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.400> three<00:01:57.670> times

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
so now that the dough is three times

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.360 
so now that the dough is three times
longer<00:01:58.300> than<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.870> is<00:01:59.050> why<00:01:59.320> we'll<00:01:59.860> do<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.130> a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
longer than it is why we'll do it a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.100 
longer than it is why we'll do it a
simple<00:02:01.180> fold<00:02:01.420> also<00:02:01.870> known<00:02:02.050> as<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.230> trifold

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
simple fold also known as a trifold

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.780 
simple fold also known as a trifold

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
before I commit to this and press this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.580 
before I commit to this and press this
down<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.330> want<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.660> make<00:02:07.780> sure<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.110> everything

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
down I want to make sure that everything

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.140 
down I want to make sure that everything
is<00:02:08.740> lined<00:02:08.950> up<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.400> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.730> straighten

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
is lined up and I want to straighten

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.910 
is lined up and I want to straighten
this<00:02:13.270> out<00:02:13.480> because<00:02:13.780> anywhere<00:02:14.350> there's<00:02:14.620> stuff

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
this out because anywhere there's stuff

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.320 
this out because anywhere there's stuff
there<00:02:15.130> should<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.430> more<00:02:15.640> dough<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.090> we

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
there should be more dough so that we

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.910 
there should be more dough so that we
don't

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
don't

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.370 
don't
the<00:02:17.010> layers<00:02:20.090> okay<00:02:21.090> there's<00:02:21.330> our<00:02:21.450> first<00:02:21.720> trifle

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the layers okay there's our first trifle

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.830 
the layers okay there's our first trifle
you<00:02:22.920> should<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.280> flush<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.300> dough<00:02:24.510> should<00:02:24.690> be

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you should be flush the dough should be

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.470 
you should be flush the dough should be
flush<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.310> from<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.030> side<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
flush here here and from this side and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.100 
flush here here and from this side and
as<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.140> we've<00:02:28.349> achieved<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:30.110> now

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
as you can see we've achieved that now

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.080 
as you can see we've achieved that now
we're<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.530> complete<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.250> second<00:02:32.610> trial

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
we're going to complete the second trial

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.550 
we're going to complete the second trial
so<00:02:33.360> we'll<00:02:33.540> rotate<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.080> dough<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.410> this

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
so we'll rotate the dough in this

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.380 
so we'll rotate the dough in this
direction<00:02:34.770> anytime<00:02:35.520> you're<00:02:35.700> lengthening<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
direction anytime you're lengthening the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.140 
direction anytime you're lengthening the
dough<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.200> open<00:02:37.680> ends<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.370> exposed<00:02:38.730> ends

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
dough the open ends of the exposed ends

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.170 
dough the open ends of the exposed ends
should<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.810> running<00:02:40.709> perpendicular<00:02:41.670> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
should be running perpendicular to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:03:01.490 
should be running perpendicular to
yourself

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.009 

now<00:03:02.500> we'll<00:03:02.680> give<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.859> second<00:03:03.400> trifold<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.900> I

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
now we'll give a second trifold and I

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.110 
now we'll give a second trifold and I
just<00:03:05.230> wanted<00:03:05.469> to<00:03:05.650> make<00:03:05.829> sure<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.519> even

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
just wanted to make sure that it's even

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.569 
just wanted to make sure that it's even
all<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.810> way<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.709> we<00:03:08.920> don't<00:03:09.069> have<00:03:09.400> any

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
all the way so that we don't have any

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.349 
all the way so that we don't have any
gaps<00:03:10.170> check<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.319> for<00:03:11.469> size<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:15.280> fins<00:03:15.700> make<00:03:16.180> sure

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
gaps check it for size in fins make sure
