I am welcome to this video tutorial
about<00:00:16.170> focus<00:00:16.710> stacking<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.279> Photoshop<00:00:18.260> having

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
about focus stacking in Photoshop having

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.580 
about focus stacking in Photoshop having
moved<00:00:19.470> over<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.430> Mac<00:00:20.640> system<00:00:21.350> last<00:00:22.350> month

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
moved over to the Mac system last month

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.340 
moved over to the Mac system last month
I<00:00:23.130> found<00:00:23.850> there's<00:00:24.000> relatively<00:00:24.359> few<00:00:24.930> free

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I found there's relatively few free

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.349 
I found there's relatively few free
applications<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> will<00:00:26.430> focus<00:00:26.820> stack<00:00:27.090> on

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
applications that will focus stack on

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.740 
applications that will focus stack on
the<00:00:27.510> Mac<00:00:27.689> system<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:30.630> just

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the Mac system so this this will just

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
the Mac system so this this will just
run<00:00:30.990> through<00:00:31.289> basically<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.340> focus<00:00:32.579> stack

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
run through basically how to focus stack

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.170 
run through basically how to focus stack

that<00:02:09.780> Photoshop<00:02:10.050> has<00:02:10.259> done<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> pretty<00:02:10.619> good

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that Photoshop has done a pretty good

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.010 
that Photoshop has done a pretty good
job<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.129> merging<00:02:11.670> them<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:11.910> together

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
job of merging them all together

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.090 
job of merging them all together
it<00:02:13.920> uses<00:02:14.370> layer<00:02:15.030> masks<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.080> hide<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it uses layer masks just to hide the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.270 
it uses layer masks just to hide the
areas<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.520> around<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.570> focus<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.350> keep<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
areas that around to focus and keep the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.100 
areas that around to focus and keep the
areas<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.030> focus<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:23.990> once<00:02:24.990> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
areas that are in focus in you once you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.600 
areas that are in focus in you once you
got<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.500> stage<00:02:25.800> has<00:02:26.040> obviously<00:02:26.340> been<00:02:26.520> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
got to this stage has obviously been a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400
