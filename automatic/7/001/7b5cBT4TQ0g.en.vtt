00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
excellent compliment there noise is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
excellent compliment there noise is
basically<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.590> non-issue<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.670> both<00:01:36.060> cameras

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
basically a non-issue on both cameras

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.520 
basically a non-issue on both cameras
and<00:01:37.500> he<00:01:37.619> goes<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.250> say<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.729> only<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.689> 6400

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and he goes on to say that only at 6400

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.639 
and he goes on to say that only at 6400
ISO<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.640> higher<00:01:41.820> does<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> 5d<00:01:42.990> Mark<00:01:43.020> 3<00:01:43.229> look

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
ISO and higher does the 5d Mark 3 look

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
ISO and higher does the 5d Mark 3 look
cleaner<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.970> basically<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.970> out

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
cleaner so basically we have the can out

5d<00:02:06.090> Mark<00:02:06.119> 3<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> excellent<00:02:07.619> because

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
5d Mark 3 and this is excellent because

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270 
5d Mark 3 and this is excellent because
well<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.580> myself<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.090> never<00:02:09.360> shoot<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.440> 6400

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
well for myself I never shoot it at 6400

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.600 
well for myself I never shoot it at 6400
for

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
for

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.450 
for
for<00:02:11.970> video<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.960> able<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> say<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
for video so to be able to say that the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.970 
for video so to be able to say that the
the<00:02:14.490> ISO<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.630> d50<00:02:16.020> 200<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.680> good<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the ISO on the d50 200 is so good that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.180 
the ISO on the d50 200 is so good that
3200<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.000> nice<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.300> clean<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.780> good<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
3200 is nice and clean as good and and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.000 
3200 is nice and clean as good and and
indistinguishable<00:02:21.000> from<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.020> Canon<00:02:22.410> 5d<00:02:22.590> Mark

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
indistinguishable from the Canon 5d Mark

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.200 
indistinguishable from the Canon 5d Mark
3<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.430> incredible

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
3 is incredible

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.530 
3 is incredible
so<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.430> other<00:02:26.550> thing<00:02:26.760> he<00:02:26.880> notes<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so the other thing he notes is that the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.830 
so the other thing he notes is that the
d50<00:02:28.110> 200<00:02:28.530> size<00:02:28.800> being<00:02:29.160> an<00:02:29.310> aps-c<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:30.090> very

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
d50 200 size being an aps-c is very

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.010 
d50 200 size being an aps-c is very
closely<00:02:31.230> matched<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.640> super<00:02:33.030> 35<00:02:33.450> millimeters

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
closely matched to super 35 millimeters

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.950 
closely matched to super 35 millimeters
sensor<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.340> will<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.580> similar<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.450> like

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
sensor so that will be similar to like

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.510 
sensor so that will be similar to like
the<00:02:37.080> canon<00:02:37.500> c300<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:39.420> such<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.590> mix

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
the canon c300 and as such you can mix

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.630 
the canon c300 and as such you can mix
and<00:02:41.730> match<00:02:41.790> clips<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:42.840> both<00:02:43.080> cameras<00:02:43.640> very

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
and match clips from both cameras very

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
and match clips from both cameras very
easily<00:02:45.110> from<00:02:46.110> super<00:02:46.440> 35<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.810> anything<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.260> that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
easily from super 35 or anything in that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
easily from super 35 or anything in that
size<00:02:49.800> like<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> C<00:02:50.520> 3300<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:52.290> c300<00:02:52.830> not<00:02:53.160> 3300

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
size like the C 3300 the c300 not 3300

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.930

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
with the nikon d50 200 in fact probably

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.710 
with the nikon d50 200 in fact probably
easier<00:02:57.510> than<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.900> Canon<00:02:58.200> 5d<00:02:58.410> Mark<00:02:58.770> 3<00:02:59.720> some

easier than the Canon 5d Mark 3 some

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.870 
easier than the Canon 5d Mark 3 some
other<00:03:00.870> points<00:03:01.320> which<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.980> big<00:03:02.250> bonus<00:03:02.700> are

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
other points which are big bonus are

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.620 
other points which are big bonus are
smaller<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.660> lighter<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.170> d50<00:03:04.680> 200

how<00:03:08.760> huge<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:10.140> me<00:03:10.260> right<00:03:10.770> at<00:03:10.920> this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
how huge this is for me right at this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.090 
how huge this is for me right at this
moment<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.610> looking<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.150> myself<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.959> my<00:03:13.560> d50

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
moment I'm looking at myself on my d50

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.210 
moment I'm looking at myself on my d50
200<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.760> I'm<00:03:15.690> able<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.140> confirm<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.800> we're

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
200 and I'm able to confirm that we're

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.540 
200 and I'm able to confirm that we're
in<00:03:17.370> focus<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:19.050> are<00:03:19.200> recording<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.070> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
in focus that we are recording and that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.500 
in focus that we are recording and that
things<00:03:20.820> are<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.630> well<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.970> that's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
things are going well so and that's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.020 
things are going well so and that's
because<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.560> articulated<00:03:26.280> screen<00:03:26.580> if<00:03:26.880> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
because of the articulated screen if you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.520 
because of the articulated screen if you
don't<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.510> articulated<00:03:28.140> screen<00:03:28.410> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
don't have that articulated screen you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.130 
don't have that articulated screen you
can't<00:03:28.739> do<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.550> for<00:03:30.300> video<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.660> won't<00:03:30.989> even

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
can't do that and for video I won't even

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.199 
can't do that and for video I won't even
use<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.440> camera<00:03:31.860> now<00:03:32.010> without<00:03:32.340> an<00:03:32.489> articulated

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
use a camera now without an articulated

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.690 
use a camera now without an articulated
screen<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.860> only<00:03:35.100> one<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.459> might<00:03:35.610> even

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
screen the only one that I might even

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.690 
screen the only one that I might even
consider<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.420> my<00:03:36.540> rx<00:03:36.840> 100<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.500> pinch<00:03:37.769> and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
consider it is my rx 100 in a pinch and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.250 
consider it is my rx 100 in a pinch and
that's<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:39.480> highly<00:03:39.870> portable

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
that's just because it's highly portable
