 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.920
 Today is former Olympic Japanese representative Takahiro Mori 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.190
 Also Thank you for seeing the defense matters today 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.090
 I used Solo Master today 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.780
 We will introduce crawl one-handed drills 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.780
 I used this Basalmaster 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.060
 This method of crawl want not that idea, or rather to work out with the kick 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.280
 Rather do you in 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:48.770
 It is important to firmly stabilize the body conscious of the trunk using the master of Basa 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 It is I'm coming but when you turn your hand and say or want to be aware of what is in the drill Te this person 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.210
 The body is blurred because I can not use my legs at the Aso Baba Monkey Master, which says I will turn it around a lot. 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.630
 It will end 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 I will turn my body where my body does not shake while using the master 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 Door of the scapular bone will be important that I mean to reduce how the the Well how there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:18.870
 Where this is that the body does not shake 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:23.340
 It of the can make is hard body shake as long as that type of course is turn 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.880
 Where in the position where the body does not shake when doing birds in the form 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.920
 And the hand of at not shake the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.149
 I think it's okay to check how long you turn it . 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.149
 Please try it 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:43.409
 Yes How would have been a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 I think that will become a better all like to swim a look at today's video 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.979
 It is for those of here if you have that you do not know if in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.790
 I do not know the child 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.310
