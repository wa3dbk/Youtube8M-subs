00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the people my name is julian zietlow 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.759
 and the personal training and you have 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.770
 wondering july little run so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.599
 criticizes what can you do then for 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.660
 cardio stuff is a lot of fun ok 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.270
 So in the running review video, so to speak 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 has been very positive by many others 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 Of course, that's also negative for many 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.820
 I was aware of no problem everyone does 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 To say what he thinks right 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 what can you do instead of running for cardio 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.769
 First of all, you can do activities 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 For example, if you only now at 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.480
 weight training is therefore only at 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 who can act and machine for a short time 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 you make super sets, that's great 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 So you have to combine two exercises and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 after that, only make the break that is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 for example, one set of trade 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.399
 Bench press use pull-ups and afterwards 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.960
 the break comes 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 so will the cardiovascular system 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.370
 training has many other advantages 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 by super sat down for example sparst 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 you have time you pump awesome horny 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 muscle in other muscle is great 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.739
 put anyone can try some either 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 for the same muscle part as 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960
 composite sentences or super sentences for 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 opposite muscle parts or what 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 you can also do that as a whole 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 three seats are left over three exercises 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 each other four monkeys so offset 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
 giganten sat at some point knows her 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 probably my video with silla there 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.509
 we make gigantic for the putsch training 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 that definitely holds that too 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.380
 Cardiovascular system occurred or 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
 in general, this is not just a circle 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.619
 for a muscle partie for example 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.570
 the chest is doing seven exercises at a time 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.820
 but really aware of the circle 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.460
 mass example cross-lifting pull-ups 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.439
 Bench press squats and so on and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 so on and so on and the exercise 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.619
 Do you run in a row without a break 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.270
 then comes one and a half to two minutes 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.579
 break and then again that will be 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 right in and then you will 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.990
 until then no more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.509
 I would always advise city too much 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 endurance on the cross or treadmill 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.750
 or to do something else eg that he 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 as a cross fed to lean 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 power I have with criticism to clear 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 the video you probably synonymous 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.880
 but I think it costs one 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.200
 you have to always cool 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.329
 only see 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.039
 how to cross fit in his normal 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.759
 Split with pure always brings it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.069
 not so easy 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.110
 krostitz is very much in many workout 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.970
 Shoulder- heavy that is, if you are 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 for example a splitter push or or 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.910
 shoulders with triceps and connection 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.840
 or what ever 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.160
 and then, so to speak, two m23 later 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.959
 days later a cross- fit unit 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 crowds again the shoulder is loaded 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.080
 stop for the joint not always so great 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.069
 but generally the elements from the cross 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.360
 fit to use 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.360
 So that really means exercises 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.379
 to execute consecutively without a break 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 makes sense in the burning of fat 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.650
 in any case more than now somehow 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.150
 to stand on the court or 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.380
 any zumba courses to go one 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.299
 Another possibility is simply the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.829
 to reduce breaks between sentences 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.680
 that means that between two bank 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.880
 For example, not only does not put pressure 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.349
 not two minutes break than three 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.709
 minutes what I know but is 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.599
 really down to 45 60 seconds 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.030
 and you will also notice 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.910
 the cardiovascular system stimulated 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 cardio training or cardio 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.079
 Exercises I always recommend bertis babys 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.650
 so to speak rock stretch jumps from 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.900
 the school 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.549
 the advanced version the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.440
 right variant requires that one the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.410
 chest and hip on the floor has 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.600
 pushes up and then I believe 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 An arm length over his out of coder 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.950
 one hand length above his 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.889
 stretched out over his 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.139
 arms outstretched to jump up 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.850
 for the girls I always say in the 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.680
 push-up stand you do not have to completely 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.989
 go down but up here 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.549
 and a little jump up and that's it 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.970
 A baby will happen when you are at the end 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.739
 from strength training just 510 hp 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.040
 makes that is really great 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.269
 and you will notice the cardiovascular system 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.870
 system or the pump is 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.579
 right 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.930
 on the ball when you are really running 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.970
 Want to do the best in the election 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.530
 sprints I also recommend again 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.299
 runway because of good damping and 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.780
 Make good shoes for everyone 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.660
 no sense here with 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.170
 euro or your converse 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.260
 or even steamed already extreme 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.130
 I would rather get started too 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.709
 I advise you to do that with advanced ones 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.630
 no beginner would necessarily 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.420
 guessing interviews but then maybe 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.130
 rather to interval runs because difference 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.959
 is sprinting my winter ball 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.600
 it is supposed to be true 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.430
 jump is that is on 15 16 17 18 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.250
 whatever career gives and 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.900
 full power 30 30 seconds 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.520
 Cracks make a minute or more 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.430
 and then it comes to rest interval 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.900
 Either you can do it well on the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.160
 Adjust treadmill or you have to stop 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.240
 repeatedly press down that you 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.640
 really then go on since 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.680
 or at the easy job or you 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.150
 just put your feet on the side 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.150
 really makes an absolute peace 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 Interval the version with the slow 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.240
 run that a bit more effectively 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.340
 pay attention to that over the sprints 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.310
 really full gas, it is called right 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.660
 It's not a quick job there 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.400
 is the afterburner effect a bit 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 higher and you do not have to be so long 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.169
 So that means if you are the one 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.080
 Sprints makes ah 30 seconds and 30 o'clock 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.820
 and 10 dormant ball have 30 seconds 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.919
 Her ten minutes at the end of her 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.870
 strength training what a lot again 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.669
 for fat burning does rope skipping 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.460
 is a great thing you can always 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.260
 to execute in the interval that is called 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.460
 really full 30 seconds again 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.600
 maybe even different 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.390
 So that means that that's it 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.310
 twice through 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.890
 before you come up again and that too 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.650
 again in intervals too 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.729
 he advanced you know that 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.590
 burden on the joints is not 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.710
 not so wonderful that means 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.160
 the muscle should be really supported 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.600
 be gentle on beginners 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.789
 They can be wonderful on the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.890
 Treadmill make fast uphill 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.200
 that's a really tough thing too 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.560
 suitable for advanced one 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.600
 really on 10 11 12 degrees the inclination 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.780
 then has relatively fast going on 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.669
 about level 6 and that, so to speak 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.720
 Exhausting interval is the skin on 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.780
 every case really pure 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.250
 Please take care that ira - so 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.660
 amino acids bcaa to date 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.580
 right after the weight training takes or 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.800
 during strength training with her 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.509
 then also during the cardio units 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.659
 well supplied with amino acids and 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.039
 No muscles degrades the protein 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.569
 I would not shake it right after 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.039
 the weight training and before the cardio 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.020
 training because that's something 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.539
 longer with the digestion needs so 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.830
 even if a result is relative 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.409
 it is still digested quickly 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.720
 too slow so to speak, so to speak 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.069
 Full throttle during cardio training 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.610
 That's why I want amino acids 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.479
 recommend 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.069
 very important first force then cardio you 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.020
 needs your concentration without 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.479
 carbohydrates has eaten or generally 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.940
 or kilocalories for concentration 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.340
 the concentration uphold at 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.470
 the strength exercises where he then force 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.780
 needs and a new maximum go 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.610
 should be so after that so to speak are the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.490
 burned carbohydrates and then you can 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.380
 you go to the devices and there in the normal 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.300
 I'm talking about short intense hosting 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.710
 always maintained no marathon 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.210
 these are the possibilities with k 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.710
 julian zietlow is billed on
