do well that a person that that can do

there's<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.880> there's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.210> difference<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there's two there's a difference in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
there's two there's a difference in
there<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.530> you're<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.890> 10<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> 40<00:01:53.759> because

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
there if you're going 10 and 40 because

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
there if you're going 10 and 40 because
that's<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> best<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.409> that's

that's the best you can do that's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
that's the best you can do that's
understandable<00:01:56.430> you'll<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.450> better<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.320> if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
understandable you'll get better but if

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.080 
understandable you'll get better but if
you're<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.680> 10<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> 40<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.820> you're

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you're going 10 and 40 because you're
