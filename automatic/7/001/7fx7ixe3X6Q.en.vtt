is<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:40.280> some<00:02:41.599> concerns

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
is going on but there is some concerns

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.690 
is going on but there is some concerns
that<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.080> need<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.620> concerned<00:02:43.980> about<00:02:44.160> now

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that you need to be concerned about now

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.690 
that you need to be concerned about now
the<00:02:45.510> first<00:02:45.780> thing<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.319> need<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
the first thing that we need to do is to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.449 
the first thing that we need to do is to
measure<00:02:48.230> how<00:02:49.230> much<00:02:49.500> what's<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.129> space

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
measure how much what's the space

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.410 
measure how much what's the space
between<00:02:50.849> your<00:02:51.360> gum<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.099> tooth<00:02:53.340> now<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
between your gum and the tooth now that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.350 
between your gum and the tooth now that
space<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.470> three<00:02:55.860> millimeter<00:02:56.360> it's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
space if it's three millimeter it's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
space if it's three millimeter it's
healthy<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.379> more<00:02:58.769> than<00:02:58.830> three

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
healthy if it's more than three

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.399 
healthy if it's more than three
millimeter<00:02:59.670> it's<00:03:00.000> an<00:03:00.269> indication<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.989> disease

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
millimeter it's an indication of disease

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.130 
millimeter it's an indication of disease
so<00:03:02.370> sometimes<00:03:02.909> if<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.360> four<00:03:03.690> millimeter

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
so sometimes if it's four millimeter

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.380 
so sometimes if it's four millimeter
that<00:03:04.500> means<00:03:04.739> there<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.040> some<00:03:05.250> issues<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.030> you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
that means there is some issues that you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.690 
that means there is some issues that you
need<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.659> be<00:03:06.780> concerned<00:03:07.170> about<00:03:07.349> if<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.519> get

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
need to be concerned about if you get

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.119 
need to be concerned about if you get
bleeding<00:03:09.269> that's<00:03:09.989> another<00:03:10.319> issue<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.800> we

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
bleeding that's another issue that we

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.970 
bleeding that's another issue that we
need<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.310> be<00:03:11.400> concerned<00:03:11.640> about<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
need to be concerned about now the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.430 
need to be concerned about now the
second<00:03:14.370> thing<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.879> do<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.319> do

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
second thing that we do have to be do

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.410 
second thing that we do have to be do
the<00:03:16.560> measurement<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.340> take<00:03:17.519> x-rays<00:03:18.090> now

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the measurement is we take x-rays now

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.259 
the measurement is we take x-rays now
these<00:03:18.599> x-rays<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.129> a<00:03:20.159> healthy<00:03:21.030> bone

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
these x-rays this is a healthy bone

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.979 
these x-rays this is a healthy bone
level<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:22.950> have<00:03:23.310> periodontal<00:03:24.239> disease

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
level now if we have periodontal disease

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.160 
level now if we have periodontal disease
at<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.620> later<00:03:25.950> stages<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.849> can<00:03:27.120> see<00:03:27.480> how<00:03:27.930> much

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
at the later stages you can see how much

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.910 
at the later stages you can see how much
bone<00:03:28.590> loss<00:03:28.890> we<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.370> now<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.299> may<00:03:30.510> not<00:03:30.720> be

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
bone loss we have now this may not be

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.490 
bone loss we have now this may not be
apparent<00:03:32.180> when<00:03:33.180> we<00:03:33.360> look<00:03:33.599> at<00:03:33.720> inside<00:03:34.290> your

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
apparent when we look at inside your

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.410 
apparent when we look at inside your
mouth<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.159> we<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.640> take<00:03:35.790> some<00:03:36.000> pictures

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
mouth but we have to take some pictures

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.080 
mouth but we have to take some pictures
no<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.680> another<00:03:38.010> reason<00:03:38.310> why<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.879> take

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
no this is another reason why we take

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.289 
no this is another reason why we take
x-rays<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.840> see<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.200> circle<00:03:41.299> that's

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
x-rays if you see that circle that's

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.259 
x-rays if you see that circle that's
where<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.870> tartar<00:03:43.349> build-up<00:03:43.909> causes<00:03:44.909> a<00:03:44.940> lot

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
where the tartar build-up causes a lot

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.369 
where the tartar build-up causes a lot
of<00:03:45.330> damage<00:03:45.810> that's<00:03:46.530> where<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:47.069> need<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:48.379> remove

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
of damage that's where we need to remove

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.309 
of damage that's where we need to remove
the<00:03:49.920> tartar<00:03:50.549> build-up<00:03:50.909> of<00:03:51.120> course<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.110> will

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
the tartar build-up of course you will

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.960 
the tartar build-up of course you will
work<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.920> hygienists<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.640> will<00:03:53.790> work

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
proper job of keeping that bacteria out

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.830 
proper job of keeping that bacteria out
of<00:04:03.180> your<00:04:03.360> mouth<00:04:03.540> now<00:04:04.110> there<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:05.840> bacteria

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
of your mouth now there is a bacteria

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.580 
of your mouth now there is a bacteria
that<00:04:07.080> causes<00:04:08.480> periodontal<00:04:09.480> disease<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.049> our

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that causes periodontal disease and our

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.630 
that causes periodontal disease and our
goal<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.659> remove<00:04:12.659> or<00:04:13.080> reduce<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.310> number

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
goal is to remove or reduce the number

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.659 
goal is to remove or reduce the number
of<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.909> bacteria<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.750> cause<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:17.430> gum

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
of the bacteria that cause the gum

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.849 
of the bacteria that cause the gum
disease<00:04:18.060> now<00:04:18.359> there<00:04:18.570> are<00:04:18.630> many<00:04:19.049> reasons<00:04:19.380> why

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
disease now there are many reasons why

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
disease now there are many reasons why
we<00:04:20.400> get<00:04:20.579> gum<00:04:20.790> disease<00:04:21.019> one<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.320> reasons<00:04:22.500> of

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
we get gum disease one of the reasons of

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.960 
we get gum disease one of the reasons of
course<00:04:23.040> is

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
course is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.720 
course is
if<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.630> don't<00:04:24.840> brush<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.320> floss<00:04:25.730> second

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
if you don't brush and floss second

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060 
if you don't brush and floss second
reason<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.210> if<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:27.840> crooked<00:04:28.290> teeth<00:04:28.500> if

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
reason is if you have crooked teeth if

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.090 
reason is if you have crooked teeth if
you<00:04:29.430> have<00:04:29.580> spaces<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.240> between<00:04:30.270> T<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:32.040> of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
you have spaces in between T so all of

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.550 
you have spaces in between T so all of
those<00:04:32.670> reasons<00:04:32.820> need<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.810> be<00:04:33.960> corrected

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
those reasons need to be corrected

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.460 
those reasons need to be corrected
before<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.610> can<00:04:35.760> eliminate<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.720> gum<00:04:37.440> disease

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
before we can eliminate the gum disease

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.740 
before we can eliminate the gum disease
I<00:04:38.130> appreciate<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.360> attention<00:04:39.920> we<00:04:40.920> have<00:04:41.880> more
