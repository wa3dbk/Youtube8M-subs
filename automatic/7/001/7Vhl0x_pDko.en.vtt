00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
stalling of any kind in low idle
typically<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.949> talking<00:00:26.519> about<00:00:26.609> what's

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
typically you're talking about what's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.070 
typically you're talking about what's
called<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> idle<00:00:28.140> air<00:00:28.349> control<00:00:28.380> valve<00:00:30.019> or<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
called the idle air control valve or the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.069 
called the idle air control valve or the
IAC<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.360> we're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> replace<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
IAC and we're going to replace that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.600 
IAC and we're going to replace that
today<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> solve<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.860> problem<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
today to solve that problem that this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.740 
today to solve that problem that this
truck<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> having<00:00:37.520> now<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.300> may<00:00:39.450> sound<00:00:39.629> like

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
truck is having now this may sound like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.580 
truck is having now this may sound like
a<00:00:39.840> contradiction<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.530> I'd<00:00:40.800> suggest<00:00:40.950> actually

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
a contradiction but I'd suggest actually

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
a contradiction but I'd suggest actually
installing<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.800> Mopar<00:00:44.190> part<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.239> Dodge<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
installing a Mopar part because Dodge is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
installing a Mopar part because Dodge is
classic<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:49.489> not<00:00:50.489> playing<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:51.030> with

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
classic for not not playing well with

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
classic for not not playing well with
aftermarket<00:00:52.110> parts<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> only<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
aftermarket parts so if you only want to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
aftermarket parts so if you only want to
do<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> once<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> Mopar<00:00:56.250> part<00:00:56.550> it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
do this once just get a Mopar part it's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.529 
do this once just get a Mopar part it's
not<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> much<00:00:57.180> more<00:00:57.390> expensive<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:59.539> you'll

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
not that much more expensive and you'll

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.200 
not that much more expensive and you'll
be<00:01:00.660> sure<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.989> solving<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> problem<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
be sure you're solving the problem so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
be sure you're solving the problem so
we'll<00:01:03.359> start<00:01:03.600> by<00:01:03.660> taking<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> throttle

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
we'll start by taking off the throttle

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.859 
we'll start by taking off the throttle
body<00:01:05.400> cover<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> getting<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.750> our

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
body cover and getting that out of our

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:41.039 
body cover and getting that out of our
way

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.410 

so<00:01:41.649> then<00:01:41.829> in<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.250> back<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.820> should<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.329> able

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
so then in the back you should be able

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.380 
so then in the back you should be able
to<00:01:43.570> see<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.250> idle<00:01:45.520> air<00:01:45.640> control<00:01:45.700> valve<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to see the idle air control valve and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:58.160 
to see the idle air control valve and
get<00:01:46.539> a<00:01:46.570> close-up<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.109> it<00:01:47.259> here

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.840 

and<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.770> first<00:01:59.979> thing<00:02:00.159> we'll<00:02:00.280> need<00:02:00.399> to<00:02:00.460> do<00:02:00.670> is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
and the first thing we'll need to do is

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.929 
and the first thing we'll need to do is
remove<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.149> connector<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:03.100> two<00:02:03.430> screws

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
remove that connector there's two screws

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:18.120 
remove that connector there's two screws
and<00:02:04.329> we'll<00:02:05.170> go<00:02:05.350> for<00:02:05.530> those<00:02:05.619> next

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.160 

now<00:02:18.670> these<00:02:18.940> two<00:02:19.270> screws<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.380> hold<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.120> are

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
now these two screws that hold it in are

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.140 
now these two screws that hold it in are
Torx<00:02:23.170> bit<00:02:23.410> screws<00:02:24.930> so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:50.900 

the<00:02:31.540> proper<00:02:31.930> size<00:02:32.170> torque<00:02:33.000> Torx<00:02:34.000> bit

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:04:22.150 

the<00:02:51.910> extension

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.180 

that<00:04:22.970> should<00:04:23.390> be<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.690> hardest<00:04:24.050> part

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:36.080 

see<00:04:27.140> strike<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:31.940> you'll<00:04:32.940> notice<00:04:33.300> -<00:04:34.880> she<00:04:35.880> can

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
see strike that you'll notice - she can

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:49.670 
see strike that you'll notice - she can
get<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.240> closer<00:04:36.510> look<00:04:36.660> at<00:04:36.900> this<00:04:48.380> make<00:04:49.380> sure<00:04:49.530> your
