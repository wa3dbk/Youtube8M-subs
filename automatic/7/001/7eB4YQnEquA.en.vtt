but<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.030> modern<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.869> appealing<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but like modern is very appealing to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.899 
but like modern is very appealing to
them<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:52.920> they're<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.220> okay<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> fetch

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
