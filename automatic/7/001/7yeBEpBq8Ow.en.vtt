00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
project started off for me as something

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
project started off for me as something
that<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.390> doing<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> grade<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> class

however<00:00:38.550> by<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> time<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.320> were<00:00:40.500> done

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
however by the time that we were done

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
however by the time that we were done
with<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> class<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.640> had<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:42.000> grown

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
with the class I had really grown

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
with the class I had really grown
attached<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
attached to it not just because I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.709 
attached to it not just because I
thought<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> cool<00:00:45.149> engineering

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
thought it was a cool engineering

thought it was a cool engineering
endeavor<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.860> also<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> saw<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
endeavor but also because I saw that it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
endeavor but also because I saw that it
really<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> potential<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> make<00:00:50.129> a

it's<00:01:30.780> an<00:01:30.990> important<00:01:31.380> advance<00:01:31.759> because<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's an important advance because it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.359 
it's an important advance because it
