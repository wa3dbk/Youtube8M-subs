what<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.230> reviewing<00:00:28.740> today<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
what my reviewing today is this is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.920 
what my reviewing today is this is
muscle<00:00:30.420> forums<00:00:31.219> combat<00:00:32.219> powder<00:00:32.930> basically

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
muscle forums combat powder basically

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.380 
muscle forums combat powder basically
what<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> case<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.860> protein<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
what it is is a case in protein it's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
what it is is a case in protein it's
slow<00:00:36.600> digesting<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.579> for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
slow digesting it's really good for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.160 
slow digesting it's really good for
before<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> bed<00:00:39.660> i<00:00:40.160> take<00:00:41.160> two<00:00:41.610> scoops

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
before you go to bed i take two scoops

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.630 
before you go to bed i take two scoops
right<00:00:43.170> before<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> bed<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.489> maybe

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
right before i go to bed you know maybe

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
right before i go to bed you know maybe
10<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:44.969> 15<00:00:45.090> minutes<00:00:45.329> while<00:00:45.809> i'm<00:00:45.870> getting<00:00:46.079> ready

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
10 or 15 minutes while i'm getting ready

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
10 or 15 minutes while i'm getting ready
for<00:00:46.379> bed<00:00:46.500> i'll<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> basically

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
for bed i'll take this and basically

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.130 
for bed i'll take this and basically
it's<00:00:49.739> got<00:00:49.920> glutamine<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.449> all<00:00:52.020> your

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it's got glutamine it's got all your

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
it's got glutamine it's got all your
proteins<00:00:52.649> bcas<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.780> easy

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
proteins bcas and it's very easy

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.619 
proteins bcas and it's very easy
digesting<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> also<00:00:56.910> feeds<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.300> muscles

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
digesting but it also feeds your muscles

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200 
digesting but it also feeds your muscles
up<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> eight<00:00:57.930> hours<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> by<00:00:59.489> taking<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.000> when

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
up to eight hours so by taking this when

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.340 
up to eight hours so by taking this when
you<00:01:00.300> go<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> bed<00:01:00.660> you're<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:00.989> feeding

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you go to bed you're actually feeding

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.189 
you go to bed you're actually feeding
your<00:01:01.530> body<00:01:01.680> while<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.550> sleeping<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
your body while you're sleeping and you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
your body while you're sleeping and you
know<00:01:04.320> you're<00:01:04.739> getting<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> nutrients

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
know you're getting all the nutrients

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.530 
know you're getting all the nutrients
you<00:01:05.670> need<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.970> recover<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.780> grow<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you need to recover and grow so in this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
you need to recover and grow so in this
right<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.140> there's<00:01:10.380> 24<00:01:10.799> grams<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.250> protein

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
right here there's 24 grams of protein

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.420 
right here there's 24 grams of protein
per<00:01:11.909> scoop<00:01:12.810> there's<00:01:13.409> fifty<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:13.950> servings<00:01:14.369> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
per scoop there's fifty two servings in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320 
per scoop there's fifty two servings in
here<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> roughly<00:01:15.600> 26<00:01:16.229> days<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.030> ask<00:01:18.210> me

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
here so roughly 26 days this will ask me

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.380 
here so roughly 26 days this will ask me
about<00:01:18.420> 26<00:01:18.990> days<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.159> 40<00:01:20.610> bucks<00:01:20.640> if

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
about 26 days and it's about 40 bucks if

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.179 
about 26 days and it's about 40 bucks if
you<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.810> bodybuilding.com<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.830> 39<00:01:23.250> 99

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
you go on bodybuilding.com it's 39 99

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.149 
you go on bodybuilding.com it's 39 99
it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> decently<00:01:26.790> priced<00:01:27.770> casing<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.920> there

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's a decently priced casing if there

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
it's a decently priced casing if there
is<00:01:29.369> four<00:01:29.729> pounds<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> believe<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> mean<00:01:31.680> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is four pounds of believe so I mean it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
is four pounds of believe so I mean it's
very<00:01:31.979> equivalent<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> euro<00:01:32.790> ends<00:01:33.090> casing<00:01:33.600> ons

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
very equivalent to euro ends casing ons

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
very equivalent to euro ends casing ons
casing<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.460> expensive<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
casing is a little more expensive and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
casing is a little more expensive and
getting<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:36.990> amount<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:38.490> protein<00:01:38.909> with

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
getting the same amount of protein with

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600 
getting the same amount of protein with
it<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.170> i<00:01:40.200> definitely<00:01:40.650> recommend<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.310> guys
