nothing<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.020> case<00:00:34.290> itself<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.760> have

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
nothing but the case itself and I have

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.549 
nothing but the case itself and I have
to<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.360> noticing<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.350> kind

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to say I'm noticing what I think is kind

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
to say I'm noticing what I think is kind
of<00:00:37.590> an<00:00:37.710> odd<00:00:37.890> trend<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.570> spigen<00:00:40.200> x'

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of an odd trend with some of spigen x'

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.619 
of an odd trend with some of spigen x'
cases<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.920> almost<00:00:41.219> most<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.879> their<00:00:42.059> cases<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
cases or almost most of their cases I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
cases or almost most of their cases I
should<00:00:42.809> say<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.469> seems<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.219> they're<00:00:44.910> cheaper

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
should say it seems like they're cheaper

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
should say it seems like they're cheaper
cases<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> ones<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:46.980> priced<00:00:47.450> $20

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
cases like the ones that are priced $20

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
cases like the ones that are priced $20
and<00:00:48.629> under<00:00:48.870> come<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> screen<00:00:49.860> shield

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and under come with the screen shield

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130 
and under come with the screen shield
and<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.000> expensive<00:00:51.510> ones<00:00:51.719> don't

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and then the more expensive ones don't

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
and then the more expensive ones don't
case<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.039> point<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:53.910> come

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
case in point this one does not come

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.819 
case in point this one does not come
with<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> screen<00:00:54.420> shield<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.020> love<00:00:55.469> their<00:00:55.620> screen

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with a screen shield I love their screen

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.650 
with a screen shield I love their screen
shields<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> already<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.210> note<00:00:57.420> 2

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
shields I already have one on my note 2

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.180 
shields I already have one on my note 2
so<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.469> issue<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.739> me<00:00:59.010> if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so it's really not an issue for me if

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
so it's really not an issue for me if
you<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> suggest<00:01:00.539> picking<00:01:01.109> one

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you don't have one I suggest picking one

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.200 
you don't have one I suggest picking one
up<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.039> grab<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.399> case<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
up when you grab this case if this is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.280 
up when you grab this case if this is
something<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> desire

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
something that you desire

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.820 
something that you desire
so<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> elusion<00:01:05.729> case<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
so what the elusion case is is a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
so what the elusion case is is a
synthetic<00:01:07.830> leather<00:01:08.130> case<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.090> has<00:01:09.270> slots

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
synthetic leather case that has slots

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for credit cards and IDs and other stuff

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840 
for credit cards and IDs and other stuff
such<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.710> money<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.220> whatnot

such as you know your money and whatnot

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
such as you know your money and whatnot
so<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> snap<00:01:16.229> closure<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.310> see

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520

flex the side out of the way and snap it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.530 
flex the side out of the way and snap it
in<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.060> close<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in just like that so I'm gonna close it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
in just like that so I'm gonna close it
up<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> first<00:01:46.020> show<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.979> really

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
up to first show you that it's really

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
up to first show you that it's really
not<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.090> thick<00:01:48.479> even<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.259> load

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
not all that thick even when you load

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.670 
not all that thick even when you load
this<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:50.040> full<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.149> cards<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:52.110> doesn't<00:01:52.530> add

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this thing full of cards it doesn't add

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
this thing full of cards it doesn't add
that<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.399> bulk<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.170> card

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that much bulk so I just got one card

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
that much bulk so I just got one card
right<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> card

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
right here and you can see the card

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
right here and you can see the card
pockets<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.420> pretty<00:01:57.990> deep<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> could

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
pockets are pretty deep and you could

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
pockets are pretty deep and you could
probably<00:01:59.070> fit<00:01:59.369> more<00:01:59.610> than<00:01:59.719> three<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.990> know

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
probably fit more than three you know

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
probably fit more than three you know
more<00:02:01.380> than<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> each<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.460> wanted

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
more than one in each one if you wanted

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.910 
more than one in each one if you wanted
to<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> couple<00:02:04.409> cards<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.799> there

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to but even with a couple cards in there

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.319 
to but even with a couple cards in there
it<00:02:05.070> doesn't<00:02:05.280> add<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> tremendous<00:02:05.790> amount<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it doesn't add a tremendous amount of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.410 
it doesn't add a tremendous amount of
bulk<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.350> note<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.099> itself<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.670> pretty<00:02:08.879> slim

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bulk the note to itself is pretty slim

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540 
bulk the note to itself is pretty slim
and<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.110> why<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.979> getting<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and I think that's why so getting in and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.460 
and I think that's why so getting in and
out<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.819> case<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.270> quite<00:02:12.450> easy<00:02:12.720> as

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
out of this case is quite easy as

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
out of this case is quite easy as
far<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.770> all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.430> ports<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.850> controls<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.540> do

far as all the ports and controls you do

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.060

the top is fully exposed as well so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.290 
the top is fully exposed as well so
pretty<00:02:36.840> cool<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.650> neat<00:02:38.190> looking<00:02:38.670> case<00:02:38.970> it's

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
pretty cool and neat looking case it's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.530 
pretty cool and neat looking case it's
kinda<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> woodgrain<00:02:41.220> texture<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
kinda you like a woodgrain texture to it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.080 
kinda you like a woodgrain texture to it
if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.020> make<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.470> out<00:02:43.640> which<00:02:44.640> feels

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
if you can make that out which feels

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.660 
if you can make that out which feels
good<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.600> well<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.959> feels<00:02:46.170> really<00:02:46.650> padded<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.640> I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
good as well it feels really padded so I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.820 
good as well it feels really padded so I
definitely<00:02:48.000> feel<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.600> though<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.080> note<00:02:49.380> 2<00:02:49.620> is

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

definitely feel as though the note 2 is
going<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.280> stay<00:02:50.940> protected<00:02:51.540> while<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.110> in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
going to stay protected while it's in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.440 
going to stay protected while it's in
the<00:02:52.410> case<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.340> mean<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> note<00:02:54.060> 2<00:02:54.270> is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
