however<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:22.109> did<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.740> anything<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.460> my

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
however they did not have anything at my

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
however they did not have anything at my
local<00:00:23.910> forever<00:00:24.300> 21<00:00:24.710> because<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.859> think<00:00:25.920> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
local forever 21 because I think it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.410

might<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.490> bit<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> smaller<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
might be a little bit of a smaller one

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.830 
might be a little bit of a smaller one
