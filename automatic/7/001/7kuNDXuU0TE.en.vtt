 compact camera 2013-2014 and the other 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.410
 award is granted by the

 publication of pr view point with which

 you will know many of you because it is

 photography and also landa the prize to 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.239
 goal 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.949
 edward they call then better now 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.039
 product let's say within what is 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.129
 this type of camera the camera know that 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.480
 It is an authentic delight in terms of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.300
 finished of it since it is a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.510
 magnesium claim the one that makes is 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.160
 have this extremely strong firm touch 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.469
 of metal carl controls 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.480
 traditional trigger is ultimately 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.670
 it's about a product that's good 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.060
 leica was the first with the x 1 that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.270
 launched a compact camera in one format 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.440
 from sensor to psc logo immediately came 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.300
 that already existed in him 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.510
 now this one that I have in hand now 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.620
 that became a machine 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.990
 improving above all that product that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.720
 lay ventured to launch improving the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 as soon as it had a cheaper price 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 incorporated one of the best things that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.870
 maybe I have the machine and that too 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 has other models of fuji that is the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.660
 viewfinder system this hybrid viewfinder 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.830
 that he makes it extremely comfortable to see 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.030
 through him with all the information 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.930
 electronics and the combination between lcd 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.979
 mail us another manufacturer 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.240
 produces this viewer in its products 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.560
 hybrid to the truth that does have a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 product in the hands that is extremely 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.189
 delicious 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 to have the sensor of this machine with 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.470
 regarding what the x100 was because it is 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.750
 a second evolution rose to 16 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.329
 million pixels that is the resolution 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.950
 that has the current one that criticisms that 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.509
 they had in regards to the approach as it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 have greatly improved both the system 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.220
 manual approach as the focus 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.420
 automatic with the focus and that as soon as 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
 to value if we can do it manually 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.130
 definitive what they did is improve the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 product that was already very good in itself 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.090
 the video also in this case the full hd 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.700
 happens to models 720 that taxes the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.280
 acquisition to 2.080 that records this in the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.080
 currently and the sensor is already l xr of 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.810
 second generation that makes it a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.150
 extremely interesting product for 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.410
 all the type of users in the lover of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.989
 the photograph of bro that has a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.670
 extraordinarily comfortable machine for 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.310
 carry everywhere the size is one 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.989
 compact camera but we have a sensor 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.880
 of large SLR camera with the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.310
 filter removal step down which 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.319
 will give us a very high performance 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.319
 when processing the images a 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.910
 goal that translates to a 23 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.150
 natural millimeters 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.820
 by 1.5 then in would turn them around 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.410
 to a usual 35 millimeters with a stench 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.530
 of luminosity that to do all that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.470
 kind of photojournalist photography 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.420
 even social is going to make us have a 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.400
 very discreet camera and we can 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 get more than optimal results 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.570
 I would say also the professionals have 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.180
 wanted to turn a camera that face 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.010
 to a second body even as a camera 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290
 when we want if a discrete form 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.600
 does photography because it becomes a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.220
 extremely interesting product has 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.930
 all the options that we can get to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.420
 order fully automatic with 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.550
 subtlety speed to diaphragm very 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.920
 easy to handle since everything is 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.750
 find in as in cameras that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.310
 we used many years ago not in 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.190
 how to the buttons to the diaphragms 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.530
 intermediate steps and it does not stop being 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.570
 it would not be to flash it like it is not 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.170
 as is logical or the microphone that has 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.240
 fuji for the subject of recording video 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.700
 all the controls all the information I 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.580
 I think it's clear enough and 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 well, I photograph art what I wanted 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.000
 do with this is a do not present a 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.650
 novelty but to congratulate a 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.360
 happy birthday because he's on his way 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.680
 meet the year in the market still you 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.230
 there are a few months left but he has already 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.609
 received these well-deserved awards and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.410
 that of course I think that fuji is giving 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 at a point in the current photograph the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.860
 which many other manufacturers better 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.900
 they have to look at themselves since I think that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 has the key to product success 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.270
 beautiful aesthetically with a performance 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.760
 optical rather than good enough and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.900
 demonstrated the full range of objectives x 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.430
 of which are of objectives 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.889
 interchangeable with this product with 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.110
 this with this fujinon optician and some 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.130
 way cameras that are very appetizing 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.780
 to have was risky the price not with the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.090
 that the machine went up that x 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.340
 you have here da x have that came in 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.290
 around two thousand and one thousand euros this one inherited 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.790
 this price say do not come sell them the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.700
 We currently sell in photographs of 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.200
 1.079 and it's a camera that then 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.970
 At first it seemed like it was going to cost 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.400
 enter the market and it has been all 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.430
 the opposite and we have met with 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.410
 many difficulties of serving products 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.030
 since they are permanently with 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.090
 breaking this because of the great success at 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.700
 world level that has so not 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.500
 you want to go through here or see it or see 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.820
 any kind of doubt or have and already 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.390
 you know that I am lying down is in the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.390
 provision
