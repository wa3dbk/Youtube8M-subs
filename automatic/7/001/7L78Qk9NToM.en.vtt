00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.000
 especially the boys and welcome back to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.309
 this new video on the fort decline 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.079
 of the staff of ultimate in Italy and 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.660
 today we are here with the play at the start of 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.160
 most unexpected player let's say why 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 he only scored one goal and one assist 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.460
 however well chosen by his 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 prediction emenike iv paid the beauty 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.449
 of 106 thousand credits its price is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.829
 turned up a little they appeared 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.269
 this morning the price was a bit low 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.040
 then let's start talking about this 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.089
 player that I didn't like but 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.189
 just for nothing 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.119
 buy its basic version but your own 

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:58.019
 Verna in thousand then then we start 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.049
 to talk about him 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.689
 always talking starting from speed 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.840
 speed that surely is one of the 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.759
 best brave and mini that since he is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.740
 like a car in ghana before ai 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.450
 very short reports so do first 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 second third and fourth then when you go in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.329
 fifth 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 do not stop it then accelerate 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:25.950
 it is 90 and the shutter speed is 87 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.170
 with 82 of reflexes and we say its more 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.140
 however, I think the speed is great 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.630
 let's talk about the god then the tir 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 as usual, it is divided into a shot at lap 48 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 although I liked it I tried to 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 do some shooting around and I learned 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.750
 post because then he then came to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.659
 haunted door in front of them but of it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.570
 we talk after 48 rounds it seems to me 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.750
 both bobba and paper like a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 value on the 50 but is very strong on shooting at 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.510
 then finalization 84 is his own 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.909
 against because he comes in front of the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.100
 goalkeeper looks like he wants to smash 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.299
 the goalkeeper's teeth because why how 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.330
 see in these clips 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.860
 he always throws the ball in his mouth at 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.290
 goalkeeper then maybe there is that time 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.879
 enter because maybe it touches the goalkeeper 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.239
 the ball takes a star turn and enters 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.150
 as on this occasion of this goal 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.620
 but really he really is a player who 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 really hard to score I made 4 goals 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.510
 in 4 games with its basic version in 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.579
 four games I would have made 10 goals 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.090
 so really really its a counter is 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.800
 definitely the end 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.459
 you see continues to pull in the mouth at 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.019
 goalkeeper then the long shot to their done 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.239
 a couple of longshot and one is gone 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.769
 inside and the other went into the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.550
 mirror therefore the launch is definitely 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.629
 one of his pros is a soprano together with 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.400
 inevitably the shooting power that 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.970
 has 88 on the card that is really a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.890
 great value then we move on to speak the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 passage that is a pro despite a 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.810
 on paper, however, it sucks his 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.560
 passage we say that at 50 in passing 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.569
 long and 70 short pass by 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.380
 we say that he is not hurt by anyway 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.360
 passages will never be found and I never say 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.700
 to make passes if not for the wings 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.379
 possibly to trigger them pass 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 long is a little lacking for the passage 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.060
 short by let's say it's a pro then 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.640
 let 's talk about trading then dribbling 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.440
 with three-star skill so if you know 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.360
 climb well however you come out you will succeed 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.950
 to parade also with quests for and between 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.049
 skin stars where allowed in words and 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.340
 in the controlled which is not limited to 3 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.130
 minutes this player as you can 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.700
 see in these clips and meghni that part 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.260
 from midfield because it does not know works 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.870
 perfect let's say he starts in midfield 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.660
 part in speed engages the fifth 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 fifth in spite of the ball control 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.690
 be a counter he manages to discard them 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.280
 all in speed but without making a skin 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.620
 if not a pretense of shooting 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.200
 he can calmly ring 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.660
 little though pass pass because 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.690
 its speed really allows it 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.870
 to driblare very well then that 78 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.590
 on paper on many more then 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.030
 let's move on to the last let's say gallant 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.810
 emenike which is the physical let's say 85 on 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.690
 card divided into 92 of strength 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.870
 physics then he mixed with this a 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.320
 this excellent speed he always succeeds 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.900
 in contrasts to free oneself therefore if the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.000
 give him a shove he throws down the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.919
 defender and then continues his run in 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.560
 speed 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.750
 then we have 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.520
 64 jump even though his shot of 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.010
 head is really good indeed I have it 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.260
 put in the pros why because we say 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.280
 not the jump may seem not too much 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.340
 good, for example, also agility e 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.980
 the balance however is to say that it is 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.360
 strong is also strong in the test shot 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.460
 as you have seen some clips 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.950
 I can't say it's not strong 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.860
 although on paper it is ugly 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.550
 value since it is the value of 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.729
 header is a precision 76 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.090
 however it's not too much though 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.560
 I think it's really good and then what 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.630
 we want to talk 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.669
 the aggressiveness of and mini than surely 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:36.400
 we don't say excellent but we lose a 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.310
 ball surely london always and I say 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.440
 always trying to get it back later 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.750
 unfortunately look at these pitches here 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.270
 they always go and I always say outside 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.620
 as you can see he leaves look 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.890
 this typical reaction in the mini 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.680
 part in speed and then I don't have here 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.380
 quoted the fact that he only takes 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.570
 poles and stringers him as you can see 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.169
 the clips only take poles and crossbars 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.680
 so let's say his shot is great 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:09.610
 the finalization sins because he 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.419
 arrived at the goalie or fails to score 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.350
 to score goals 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.479
 if not maybe head on or on the long 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.030
 shot or right in front of the goalkeeper 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.610
 that pulls of power but not always the 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.450
 succeeds also because of the four stars 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.320
 weak foot 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.720
 he is right-handed but he is a left-handed man he does not 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.940
 succeeds to the left-handed or for the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.180
 then cross as in this case 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.400
 really really an uncertain player i 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.500
 his pros are speed shooting physical strength 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.110
 dribbling long header power 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.389
 shooting and passing as mentioned he has 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.060
 many are just the substantive against are 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.530
 that is, the shooting around that we say is me 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.280
 liked however on the card is a 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.070
 Fourty eight 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.140
 then the ball control the finalization 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.310
 especially the final grade I give him is 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.470
 a 7 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.270
 tell me yours in the comments and therefore 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.270
 guys for this video, all bye bye
