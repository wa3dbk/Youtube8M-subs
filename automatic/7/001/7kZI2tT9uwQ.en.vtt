hi<00:00:03.689> I'm<00:00:03.840> Steve<00:00:04.080> Fisher<00:00:04.410> if<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.890> ever<00:00:05.009> thought

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
hi I'm Steve Fisher if you ever thought

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.590 
hi I'm Steve Fisher if you ever thought
about<00:00:05.339> adding<00:00:05.549> electronics<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.450> your

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
about adding electronics to your

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.690 
about adding electronics to your
acoustic<00:00:07.109> drum<00:00:07.290> set<00:00:07.500> well<00:00:08.220> that's<00:00:08.370> called<00:00:08.580> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
acoustic drum set well that's called a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700 
acoustic drum set well that's called a
hybrid<00:00:08.880> set<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.469> really

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
hybrid set and you can get really

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.810 
hybrid set and you can get really
creative<00:00:11.010> when<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.460> that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
creative when you do that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.850 
creative when you do that
adding<00:00:12.450> electronics<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.290> your<00:00:13.410> acoustic<00:00:13.710> drum

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
adding electronics to your acoustic drum

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.230 
adding electronics to your acoustic drum
set<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.160> nothing<00:00:14.340> different<00:00:14.849> than<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> buy

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
set is nothing different than if you buy

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150 
set is nothing different than if you buy
an<00:00:15.509> effect<00:00:15.839> symbol<00:00:16.199> or<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.410> extra<00:00:16.619> cowbell<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
an effect symbol or an extra cowbell to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.620 
an effect symbol or an extra cowbell to
add<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.490> acoustic<00:00:17.880> set<00:00:18.090> you're<00:00:18.390> getting

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
add to your acoustic set you're getting

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.390 
add to your acoustic set you're getting
more<00:00:18.750> sounds<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.949> make<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> play<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
more sounds and you can make you play a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980 
more sounds and you can make you play a
little<00:00:20.550> differently<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.570> you're<00:00:21.689> being<00:00:21.810> more

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
little differently but you're being more

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
little differently but you're being more
creative<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.529> more<00:00:22.740> sounds<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.699> great

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
creative with more sounds the great

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.609 
creative with more sounds the great
thing<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.210> adding<00:00:24.480> electronics<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
thing with adding electronics is the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
thing with adding electronics is the
sound<00:00:25.949> choices<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.550> endless

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
sound choices are endless

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just give you an idea for acoustic drum

just give you an idea for acoustic drum
triggering<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.800> I've<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
triggering what we have here I've got my

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
triggering what we have here I've got my
beautiful<00:00:41.790> DW<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.110> we're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
beautiful DW set and that's why we're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
beautiful DW set and that's why we're
talking<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.559> acoustic<00:00:43.860> drums<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
talking about acoustic drums here and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
talking about acoustic drums here and
using<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.850> DW<00:00:45.270> set<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> turn<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
using my DW set I'm going to turn the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.760 
using my DW set I'm going to turn the
volume<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:47.879> SPD<00:00:48.360> 30<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> only

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
volume down on my SPD 30 so the only

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.630 
volume down on my SPD 30 so the only
thing<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.039> hearing<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> acoustic

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
thing you're hearing is the acoustic

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.260 
thing you're hearing is the acoustic
kick<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> acoustic<00:00:51.510> snare<00:00:56.149> now<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.210> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
kick and the acoustic snare now if I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
kick and the acoustic snare now if I
turn<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> volume<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.039> hear<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
turn up the volume you actually hear the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
turn up the volume you actually hear the
difference<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.500> triggers

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
difference and of course the triggers

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
difference and of course the triggers
trigger<00:01:05.309> perfectly<00:01:08.900> practice<00:01:09.900> everything

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
trigger perfectly practice everything

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.719 
trigger perfectly practice everything
that<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.380> doing<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> essence<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.549> those

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that I'm doing now in essence for those

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310 
that I'm doing now in essence for those
of<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> curious<00:01:12.510> how<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.780> works<00:01:13.049> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of you curious how this works it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
of you curious how this works it's
pretty<00:01:13.350> simple<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.490> doing<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
pretty simple what I'm actually doing is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
pretty simple what I'm actually doing is
turning<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.299> coup<00:01:15.659> stick<00:01:15.720> drums<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.380> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
turning my coup stick drums into an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
turning my coup stick drums into an
electronic<00:01:17.040> drum<00:01:17.130> pad<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
electronic drum pad because when I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
electronic drum pad because when I
strike<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> drum<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.320> energy<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> drum

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
strike the drum the energy from the drum

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.679 
strike the drum the energy from the drum
goes<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> trigger<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> trigger

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
goes to the trigger and then the trigger

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
goes to the trigger and then the trigger
sends<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> signal<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> module<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
sends a signal to the module and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.740 
sends a signal to the module and
triggers<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> sound<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.360> pretty<00:01:24.509> simple

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
triggers a sound so it's pretty simple

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
triggers a sound so it's pretty simple
but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.770> complex<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> don't

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but it can be very complex if you don't

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.440 
but it can be very complex if you don't
know<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.759> you're<00:01:26.850> doing<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
know what you're doing you and you're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
know what you're doing you and you're
not<00:01:27.570> using<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.020> equipment<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.619> that's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
not using the right equipment so that's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.289 
not using the right equipment so that's
why<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> role<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.520> stuff<00:01:29.700> works<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> great

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
why the role and stuff works so great

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
why the role and stuff works so great
and<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.659> why<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> pros<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.880> do<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> an

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and that's why the pros use it do you an

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
and that's why the pros use it do you an
idea<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> some<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> options<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
idea of some of the options I have that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.840 
idea of some of the options I have that
I<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.159> triggering<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.610> acoustic

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I can do with triggering my acoustic

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
I can do with triggering my acoustic
drums<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.479> making<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> hybrid<00:01:37.049> set<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.619> play<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
drums for making a hybrid set we play a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
drums for making a hybrid set we play a
couple<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.220> different<00:01:38.520> sounds<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.380> first

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
couple of different sounds in here first

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
couple of different sounds in here first
of<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> add<00:01:41.850> any<00:01:42.119> sound<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
of all you can add any sound you want to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
of all you can add any sound you want to
for<00:01:43.890> example<00:01:44.250> let's<00:01:44.490> say<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> bass<00:01:44.880> drum<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
for example let's say the bass drum I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.030 
for example let's say the bass drum I
can<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> snare<00:01:48.210> drum

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.550 

to<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.700> fight<00:01:51.880> bell<00:01:52.150> and<00:01:52.390> since<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.170> RT

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
to have a fight bell and since the RT

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560 
to have a fight bell and since the RT
10's<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:53.980> dual<00:01:54.160> trigger<00:01:54.370> i<00:01:54.640> have<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.180> head<00:01:55.420> and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
10's is dual trigger i have a head and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.770 
10's is dual trigger i have a head and
rim<00:01:59.730> now<00:02:00.730> i've<00:02:00.850> got<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> bar<00:02:01.270> trigger<00:02:01.540> pad

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
rim now i've got the bar trigger pad

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.840 
rim now i've got the bar trigger pad
here<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.230> y<00:02:02.470> know<00:02:02.530> something<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.490> haven't

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
here and y know something you haven't

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.160 
here and y know something you haven't
heard<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.090> bar<00:02:04.240> trigger<00:02:04.540> simply<00:02:04.930> because

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
heard the bar trigger simply because

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.200 
heard the bar trigger simply because
it's<00:02:05.680> not<00:02:05.800> going<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.160> get<00:02:06.370> any<00:02:06.580> vibrations

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
it's not going to get any vibrations

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.480 
it's not going to get any vibrations
baguette<00:02:07.390> has<00:02:07.540> complete<00:02:08.050> isolation<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
baguette has complete isolation from the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.460 
baguette has complete isolation from the
drum<00:02:09.760> even<00:02:09.940> though<00:02:10.030> we've<00:02:10.180> attached<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:11.110> b<00:02:11.260> t1

drum even though we've attached the b t1
to<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:11.980> acoustic<00:02:12.490> drum<00:02:12.670> i'm<00:02:13.210> not<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.540> to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
to the acoustic drum i'm not going to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.000 
to the acoustic drum i'm not going to
get<00:02:13.660> any<00:02:13.810> crosstalk<00:02:14.260> which<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> beautiful

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
get any crosstalk which is the beautiful

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.710 
get any crosstalk which is the beautiful
thing<00:02:15.280> using<00:02:15.790> Roland's<00:02:16.180> advanced<00:02:16.450> triggering

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
thing using Roland's advanced triggering

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.510 
thing using Roland's advanced triggering
technology<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.800> I've<00:02:17.890> got<00:02:18.010> my<00:02:18.100> bar<00:02:18.280> trigger

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
technology so I've got my bar trigger

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.790 
technology so I've got my bar trigger
pad<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> dual<00:02:19.540> trigger<00:02:19.780> stare<00:02:20.140> take

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
pad here and the dual trigger stare take

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.350 
pad here and the dual trigger stare take
a<00:02:20.830> listen<00:02:21.010> I've<00:02:21.220> got<00:02:21.370> three<00:02:21.670> very<00:02:21.940> distinct

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
a listen I've got three very distinct

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360 
a listen I've got three very distinct
and<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:22.750> different<00:02:23.290> sounds<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> don't

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and very different sounds but you don't

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.870 
and very different sounds but you don't
hear<00:02:24.490> any<00:02:24.640> crosstalk<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.710> idea<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.250> right

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
hear any crosstalk get the idea so right

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.430 
hear any crosstalk get the idea so right
there<00:02:34.090> I've<00:02:34.210> got<00:02:34.240> some<00:02:34.660> really<00:02:34.870> cool<00:02:34.990> sounds

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
there I've got some really cool sounds

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.990 
there I've got some really cool sounds
there<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.710> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> utilize<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.760> again<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
there that going to utilize so again you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.310 
there that going to utilize so again you
can<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.240> how<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.480> trigger<00:02:37.810> any<00:02:37.990> sound<00:02:38.260> I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
can see how I can trigger any sound I

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.500 
can see how I can trigger any sound I
want<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> let's<00:02:39.220> go<00:02:39.340> back<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.880> full<00:02:40.300> drum

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
want to let's go back to the full drum

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.230 
want to let's go back to the full drum
kit<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.980> great<00:02:42.160> thing<00:02:42.340> also<00:02:42.490> about<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.820> SPD

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
kit the great thing also about the SPD

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.390 
kit the great thing also about the SPD
30<00:02:43.540> besides<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> four<00:02:44.680> dual<00:02:44.830> trigger<00:02:45.040> inputs

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
30 besides the four dual trigger inputs

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.790 
30 besides the four dual trigger inputs
it<00:02:45.520> has<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> hi-hat<00:02:46.330> input<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.170> I've<00:02:47.260> got<00:02:47.380> my<00:02:47.500> FD

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
it has a hi-hat input so I've got my FD

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.670 
it has a hi-hat input so I've got my FD
8<00:02:47.890> plugged<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.000> actually<00:02:49.180> said<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.440> IBT

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
8 plugged in so I actually said for IBT

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280 
8 plugged in so I actually said for IBT
1<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.220> hi-hat<00:02:51.610> pad<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:53.110> play

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
1 to be the hi-hat pad so I can play

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.500 
1 to be the hi-hat pad so I can play
this<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.130> great<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.760> full<00:02:55.000> drum<00:02:55.180> set<00:02:55.390> that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
this is great little full drum set that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:17.490 
this is great little full drum set that
I've<00:02:55.570> got<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.050> here<00:02:56.260> take<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> listen

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.930 
able to play a little sounds now the fun
thing<00:03:21.740> about<00:03:21.800> trigger<00:03:22.160> my<00:03:22.310> acoustic<00:03:22.730> drums

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
thing about trigger my acoustic drums

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.210 
thing about trigger my acoustic drums
and<00:03:23.180> with<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> hybrid<00:03:23.690> set<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.560> allows<00:03:24.890> you

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
and with a hybrid set is it allows you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.400 
and with a hybrid set is it allows you
to<00:03:25.430> play<00:03:25.730> different<00:03:26.570> sounds<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.320> you're

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
to play different sounds so if you're

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.600 
to play different sounds so if you're
going<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.560> play<00:03:27.710> different<00:03:28.070> styles

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
going to play different styles

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.830 
going to play different styles
you've<00:03:28.850> got<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.120> sounds<00:03:29.480> there<00:03:29.630> to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
you've got the sounds there to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.230 
you've got the sounds there to
complement<00:03:30.350> with<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.460> acoustic<00:03:31.850> drum<00:03:32.000> set

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
complement with your acoustic drum set

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.810 
complement with your acoustic drum set
for<00:03:32.470> example<00:03:33.470> say<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> want<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.310> play<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> ballad

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
for example say I want to play a ballad

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.730 
for example say I want to play a ballad
well<00:03:35.750> instead<00:03:35.960> of<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.110> lot<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.320> outboard<00:03:36.710> gear

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
well instead of a lot of outboard gear

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.800 
well instead of a lot of outboard gear
as<00:03:37.400> far<00:03:37.610> as<00:03:37.670> having<00:03:37.790> lots<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.210> reverb<00:03:38.570> zand

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
as far as having lots of reverb zand

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.660 
as far as having lots of reverb zand
stuff<00:03:38.960> like<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.290> I've<00:03:39.770> got<00:03:39.980> effects<00:03:40.400> built

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
stuff like that I've got effects built

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.910 
stuff like that I've got effects built
into<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.390> SPD<00:03:41.780> 30<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.230> there's<00:03:42.350> same<00:03:42.740> thing

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
into the SPD 30 and there's same thing

I'm going to also do is actually play
along<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.820> loop<00:04:59.030> because<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.630> SPD<00:05:00.110> 30<00:05:00.410> has

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
along with a loop because the SPD 30 has

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.280 
along with a loop because the SPD 30 has
what's<00:05:01.280> called<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.669> phrase<00:05:02.150> loop<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:03.140> can

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290

now the great thing about the BT one is

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.200 
now the great thing about the BT one is
it's<00:05:42.110> not<00:05:42.170> only<00:05:42.470> perfect<00:05:42.950> for<00:05:43.610> adding

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
it's not only perfect for adding

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.730 
it's not only perfect for adding
additional<00:05:44.270> sounds<00:05:44.960> but<00:05:45.140> like<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:45.380> did<00:05:45.530> in<00:05:45.650> that

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
additional sounds but like I did in that

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.890 
additional sounds but like I did in that
last<00:05:45.800> example<00:05:46.130> I<00:05:46.610> used<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.330> for<00:05:47.480> a<00:05:47.510> function

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
last example I used it for a function

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.420 
last example I used it for a function
which<00:05:48.020> is<00:05:48.140> starting<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.650> stopping<00:05:48.830> loops<00:05:49.160> and

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
which is starting and stopping loops and

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.100 
which is starting and stopping loops and
you<00:05:49.460> can<00:05:49.850> also<00:05:49.970> use<00:05:50.210> it<00:05:50.330> for<00:05:50.360> patch<00:05:50.720> up<00:05:50.930> patch

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
you can also use it for patch up patch

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.630 
you can also use it for patch up patch
down<00:05:51.350> or<00:05:51.590> turning<00:05:51.830> effects<00:05:52.070> on<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.400> off<00:05:52.460> so

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
down or turning effects on and off so

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.730 
down or turning effects on and off so
the<00:05:52.730> BT<00:05:53.000> one<00:05:53.180> is<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.540> perfect<00:05:54.050> product<00:05:54.590> for
