 I have a galaxy and if they do not appear good 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530

 look for your device in the case of 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.579

 to appear the types of download there 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.609
 developing 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:19.329
 the version nobody releases the release version 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.950
 candidate that means rc or the version 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.859
 stable that is the one that we are going to lower 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.929
 we already depend on the connection that 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.600
 have internet is not going to send you 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.939
 no other pages all the roms 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.789
 they are on the cyanogenmod server 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.299
 which your download will be direct like this 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.299
 that good 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.430
 let's start our terminal in mode 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.800
 recovery this tutorial applies to all 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 the devices not only with the galaxy 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.910
 and but with most devices 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.910
 that stand being people of form 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.040
 official so good let's make them 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.040
 wipes we are going to go to uip 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.630
 uy pediatrist gÃ¼ipe datafactory reset 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.930
 and we are going to give it to yes 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.840
 we hope blessed we give to where it says 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.410
 uip cache partition we're going now and it's 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.410
 again 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.580
 and we are going to advance 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.950
 and we will select whipped albil 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.230
 cache we are going to give yes 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.940
 what list we are going to give back and we 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.849
 let's go to the option that says install 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.269
 yes from sticker now we are going to go to 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.790
 the option that says shows and from stickers 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:38.560
 and we are going to look for the rom in this case it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.140
 call cms 7.2 point zero and here cooper 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.599
 for the galaxy 6 but it will appear 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 in hunger your device is going to give 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.530
 enter and we will give you 10 install cm 7 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.410
 there it is going to install and we are already seeing 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.410
 we hope the approach tantito the camera 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.250
 is already installed good while they 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.320
 I want to recommend I want to tell you that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
 they must already have the root and they must 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.470
 have the club world mode recovery 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.020
 version 5.0 point 2 or higher for 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.300
 to be able to install cyanogenmod but from what 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.920
 otherwise they will not be able to install it anymore 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.070
 as we can see it is already ending 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.170
 almost install must have already 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.420
 obviously rock and flashed this 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 alternative route let's give it 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.250
 back and we're going to give you tank reboots or 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.870
 is to proceed to restart our 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.970
 device 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.560
 We need to see 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.330
 well I also want to tell you that this 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.760
 it's fully functional it's not going to 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.900
 fail nothing works the wifi and 3g the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.900
 camera all 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.000
 also still for those who take me to 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.640
 ask about the progress of cyanogenmod 9 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.420
 and now they 're going to launch betas going to 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.560
 wait and finish a final version 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.860
 many ask me camera 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.340
 samsung galaxy s already done the fact to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.230
 see if later I make a video 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.250
 we are already seeing how it is starting 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.250
 quickly the rom 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.280
 me personal I really like 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.320
 cyanogenmod because it eliminates what's coming 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.640
 being the touchwiz interface of samsung 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.260
 that the truth if it encouraged you enough and 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.239
 fundamental is that we can also do 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.940
 overclock to our device that is 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.160
 the overclock you can do a little more 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.950
 fast and the samsung alexis has a 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.060
 800 megahertz processor for not uploading 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.890
 to 900 youngers so that we can therefore 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.890
 do things a little faster 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:43.460
 let's do the android setup I want 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.810
 that this video then does not meet much 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.730
 time on youtube because I am 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.670
 recording on hd and what edits it and what 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.680
 upload youtube so good we're going to 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.300
 skip all the steps I'm going to 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.940
 teach the clothes that is already totally 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.370
 stable the most important things and 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.830
 good and I start in a hospi of the set up 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.290
 from android we are seeing the interface 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.790
 As I say, it's pretty fluid, we can 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.190
 do the pinsi to zoom without any 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.289
 problem let's see what approach so 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.419
 headline here through 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.189
 the notification center that we can 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.169
 modify according to our tastes the 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.629
 music player we will teach in 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.550
 the camera that works without any 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:26.740
 problem and we are looking at the camera 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.740
 the autofocus and everything works 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.960
 we need good and the good of sweet 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.080
 changes between the camera and the video 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.090
 everything works without any problem like that 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.760
 Well, well let's see something else 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.450
 Quick here, as you can see, there are already 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.610
 3g data next to the carrier expects that 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.210
 something this camera 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.409
 there is already working 3g data 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.280
 in this case the network 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.840
 hcp 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.470
 let's go quickly adjustments 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.320
 and we're going to go to 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.930
 a wood about the phone and we see that 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.850
 we have the android version 2.3 points 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.160
 7 in the baseband of the baseband is with 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.500
 termination cafe 7 so if you 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.800
 you live in Latin America you will not fail 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.630
 the 3g in this case I am from Mexico in 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.450
 this case the kernel there tells us of 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.850
 who is and our cpu that is we have a 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.850
 jc arm11 processor 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.030
 the version of cyanogenmod that is version 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.550
 7 points cooper and will name there we 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.120
 all this appears in the version of 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.949
 android 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.710
 so, well, I recommend you 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.650
 install in this rom on your device since 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.240
 It is totally stable so it can 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.240
 now for using it 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.690
 in a normal way the daily life if you 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.699

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.819
