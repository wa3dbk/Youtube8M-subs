 constructions and chests of others is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.520
 say do not destroy anything and you do not 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.520
 take out all the chests of the world and 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.490
 that they have enough material there and not 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.870
 we like that they are spending because well 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.900
 we are several who made this map 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.530
 and everyone has a chest with their 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.110
 belongings let's say 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.660
 and well there are people who simply enter 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 to spend it if it goes then do not do this 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.890
 please though as I said 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.069
 here on the other side of the rail 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.880
 we have a ladder for people 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.670
 that appear and say in the middle of the map 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 and they do not show up there and also 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.200
 we have another chest that is there with another 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.200
 trolley so there's no problem 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 and well, we simply do what 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.350
 same as we did with the other trolley 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.180
 simply place it on the rail the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 we push a little and then it's the same 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.930
 in any instance there was already 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.850
 distance covers the 500 meters that does not 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.480
 matter which side you appear on equal 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.160
 you will get the achievement 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.110
 even though 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.300
 for people who doubt this 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.320
