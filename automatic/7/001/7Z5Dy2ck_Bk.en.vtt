well<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.380> clearly<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.400> micro

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
well this one clearly is not a micro

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
well this one clearly is not a micro
this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> 16<00:00:28.230> inches<00:00:28.650> long

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
this is 16 inches long

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
this is 16 inches long
nose<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.880> tip<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> tail<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.320> uses<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
nose to tip of the tail it uses a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.650 
nose to tip of the tail it uses a
coaxial<00:00:32.550> design<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.329> you've<00:00:33.450> got

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
coaxial design that's where you've got

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920 
coaxial design that's where you've got
two<00:00:34.320> counter-rotating<00:00:34.950> main<00:00:35.910> rotors<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:36.690> top

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
two counter-rotating main rotors up top

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
two counter-rotating main rotors up top
that's<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.590> stability<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.879> here

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that's for stability and then back here

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
that's for stability and then back here
on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> tail<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> tail<00:00:40.890> prop

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
on the tail you see there is a tail prop

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
on the tail you see there is a tail prop
but<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.730> facing<00:00:41.969> upward<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.649> give

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
but it's facing upward that's to give

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
but it's facing upward that's to give
thrust<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> tail<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.270> give<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.719> forward

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
thrust from the tail to give a forward

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.610 
thrust from the tail to give a forward
or<00:00:46.350> rearward<00:00:46.860> pitch<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> helicopter<00:00:48.989> P

or rearward pitch to the helicopter P
ITC<00:00:50.489> H<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.510> causes<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> be

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
ITC H and that's what causes it to be

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
ITC H and that's what causes it to be
able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> move<00:00:53.340> forward<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
able to move forward and back up and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
able to move forward and back up and
down<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.469> from<00:00:55.710> thrust<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
down is just from thrust and then to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
down is just from thrust and then to
turn<00:00:57.449> left<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.770> changes<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
turn left and right it just changes the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
turn left and right it just changes the
relative<00:00:59.579> speeds<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.199> two<00:01:01.379> rotors<00:01:01.800> ones

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
relative speeds of the two rotors ones

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
relative speeds of the two rotors ones
rotating<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:02.910> direction<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> others

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
rotating one direction the others

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
rotating one direction the others
rotating<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> other<00:01:04.379> change<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> speed<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
rotating the other change the speed and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.660 
rotating the other change the speed and
it<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.510> turn<00:01:06.810> here's<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> controller<00:01:08.310> it's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it will turn here's the controller it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
it will turn here's the controller it's
pretty<00:01:08.939> simple<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.479> straightforward<00:01:09.780> you've

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pretty simple and straightforward you've

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
pretty simple and straightforward you've
got<00:01:10.920> throttle<00:01:11.369> over<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> left<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
got throttle over on the left as is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
got throttle over on the left as is
pretty<00:01:12.900> normal<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.290> Air<00:01:13.530> Hogs

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pretty normal for Air Hogs

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
pretty normal for Air Hogs
craft<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.659> no

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
craft but as you can see there's no

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600

return<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> bottom<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.470> set

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
return to the bottom so you can just set

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
return to the bottom so you can just set
it<00:01:19.740> into<00:01:20.009> place<00:01:20.159> where<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> want<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it into place where you want it and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
it into place where you want it and
it'll<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.630> stay<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> right

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it'll just stay there and on the right

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.679 
it'll just stay there and on the right
hand<00:01:23.369> side<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.939> Y<00:01:24.090> R<00:01:24.330> you're

turning left and right and you're have

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
turning left and right and you're have
your<00:01:26.610> forward<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> backward<00:01:27.450> control<00:01:27.869> and

your forward and backward control and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
your forward and backward control and
you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.770> adjust<00:01:28.979> those<00:01:29.430> together<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.360> red

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you can adjust those together the red

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
you can adjust those together the red
knob<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.470> adjust<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.490> spinning<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
knob is to adjust the spinning so in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
knob is to adjust the spinning so in

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
case it turns on its own you can stop

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
case it turns on its own you can stop
that<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:36.780> no<00:01:37.020> charge

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that as you can see there's no charge

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
unusual for an Air Hogs controller
normally<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> hook<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.240> controller<00:01:42.689> right

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
