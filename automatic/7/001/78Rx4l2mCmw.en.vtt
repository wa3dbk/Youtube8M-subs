00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.580 
insects hard exoskeleton makes it

difficult for the insect to grow this is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.490 
difficult for the insect to grow this is
because<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.130> exoskeleton<00:03:25.090> can't<00:03:25.480> get<00:03:25.780> larger

molting<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.220> process<00:03:33.700> where<00:03:33.940> an<00:03:34.060> insect

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
molting is the process where an insect

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.190 
molting is the process where an insect

sheds its outer skeleton the insect

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.010 
sheds its outer skeleton the insect
emerges<00:03:39.010> from<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.370> old<00:03:39.520> skin<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.810> new
