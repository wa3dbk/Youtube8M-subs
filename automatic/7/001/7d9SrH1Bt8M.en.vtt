to line up the frame within the recess

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.270 
to line up the frame within the recess
do<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:44.750> by<00:01:44.960> moving<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.440> frame<00:01:45.680> left<00:01:46.040> and

on smaller windows like this one you can

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.950 
on smaller windows like this one you can
check<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.760> gap<00:01:52.910> with<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.210> fingertips<00:01:53.690> to
