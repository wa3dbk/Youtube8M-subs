gaming experience preference so what I
found<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.850> shorter<00:01:15.180> ones<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.689> see

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
found with is the shorter ones I see

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.520 
found with is the shorter ones I see
them<00:01:16.259> more<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.619> protecting<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.640> analog<00:01:18.000> stick

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
them more as protecting my analog stick

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.460 
them more as protecting my analog stick
doesn't<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.710> improve<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.340> gaming<00:01:20.580> experience

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
doesn't not improve my gaming experience

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.950 
doesn't not improve my gaming experience
whereas<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:23.189> games<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.700> destiny<00:01:24.090> well<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
whereas for games like destiny well I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.460 
whereas for games like destiny well I
would<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> total<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.470> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
would use this one the total one and I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
would use this one the total one and I
actually<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.270> analog

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
actually just put it over this analog

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually just put it over this analog
stick<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.299> Daleks

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
stick just this one this this Daleks

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.969 
stick just this one this this Daleks
stick<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.439> use<00:01:34.619> control<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:36.119> gun<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
stick where I use control my my gun and

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.569 
stick where I use control my my gun and
when<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.729> does<00:01:38.970> give<00:01:39.210> me<00:01:39.360> better<00:01:40.280> control<00:01:41.280> over

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
when it does give me better control over

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.899 
when it does give me better control over
it<00:01:41.759> sniping<00:01:42.470> improves<00:01:43.490> right<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it sniping improves right I think it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
it sniping improves right I think it
improves<00:01:45.530> for<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> shorter<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
improves for a shorter one like the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.230 
improves for a shorter one like the
common<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.540> x1<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.460> found<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
common of x1 this one I found this one a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.440 
common of x1 this one I found this one a
bit<00:01:51.390> hard<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.770> elastic<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
bit hard to put on my elastic if I just

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.310 
bit hard to put on my elastic if I just
flip<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.079> inside<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:56.000> put<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> over<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.899> wrap

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
flip it inside out put it over and wrap

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.039 
flip it inside out put it over and wrap
it<00:01:58.469> over<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.540> shot<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it over if I don't get in one shot I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.690 
it over if I don't get in one shot I
gotta<00:02:01.229> keep<00:02:01.350> trying<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> time<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> got

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
gotta keep trying well this time I got

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
gotta keep trying well this time I got
one<00:02:02.850> shot<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.390> always<00:02:03.899> found<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.409> passed<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
one shot I always found and passed that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
one shot I always found and passed that
this<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.090> difficult

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this one was a little bit more difficult

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.260 
this one was a little bit more difficult
to<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> others<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.789> terms<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to put on than the others so in terms of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
to put on than the others so in terms of
playing<00:02:09.629> games<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:09.929> Madden<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.500> shadow<00:02:10.920> mode

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
playing games like Madden or shadow mode

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.910 
playing games like Madden or shadow mode
or<00:02:11.310> I'll<00:02:11.879> put<00:02:12.420> these<00:02:12.599> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
or I'll put these on
but<00:02:14.310> that's<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.150> protect<00:02:15.300> my

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
but that's just more to protect my

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.050 
but that's just more to protect my
elastic<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.130> first<00:02:17.400> personal<00:02:17.730> shooters
