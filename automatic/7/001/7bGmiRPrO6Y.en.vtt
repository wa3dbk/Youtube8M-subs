00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.110
 take it, dick 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.800
 I have a logical mind. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 It is inconceivable to me that in a street 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 numbering can be part and parcel of the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:33.469
 same side 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:36.300
 I can not think of it all of a sudden 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.210
 does not work more headlight 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.469
 I'm irregular nor was there a Brigadian. 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 how strange looking at the signal is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.969
 Working only the top does not work now 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 neither the high nor the low I suspect 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 Could it be I screwed a screw that gave 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 term and the wire loosing it here 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.649
 have to study by tightening the screws 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.649
 Of course I do not have any more pains. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.220
 there the guardian the curious plump value 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.630
 appears in video vigilantes 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.740
 who has the helmet 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 the camera to him so but here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.729
 asked Nelson to ask for a grandson to take me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.600
 had a camera so that it passed the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 compose the league's football team in this 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.850
 who was leaving the bike to the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 try time she has no leg 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.700
 small managed 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.650
 There are people who can get bitten by 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.330
 a dog once can understand 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.330
 It will have to be a lot more bank.
