you

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.270 

if<00:01:28.570> your<00:01:28.750> underspin<00:01:29.380> approach<00:01:29.770> shots<00:01:30.070> are

if your underspin approach shots are

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.249 
if your underspin approach shots are
going<00:01:30.549> in<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.789> net<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.390> could<00:01:31.600> be<00:01:31.750> one<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.079> two

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
going in the net it could be one of two

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.249 
going in the net it could be one of two
things<00:01:32.530> number<00:01:33.219> one<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.969> could<00:01:34.450> be<00:01:34.600> stopping

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
things number one you could be stopping

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.270 
things number one you could be stopping
when<00:01:35.439> you<00:01:35.530> hit<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.829> ball

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
when you hit the ball

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
when you hit the ball
remember<00:01:37.060> if<00:01:37.149> you<00:01:37.240> come<00:01:37.450> up<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.659> hit<00:01:37.899> your<00:01:38.079> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
remember if you come up to hit your and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.010 
remember if you come up to hit your and
put<00:01:38.259> your<00:01:38.619> approach<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.490> stop<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.329> upper

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
put your approach and you stop the upper

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.440 
put your approach and you stop the upper
body<00:01:41.289> tends<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.920> go<00:01:42.039> down<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:43.060> racket

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
body tends to go down and the racket

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.149 
body tends to go down and the racket
goes<00:01:43.630> down<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.170> simply<00:01:44.590> drive<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:45.009> ball

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
goes down and you simply drive the ball

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.840 
goes down and you simply drive the ball
in<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.399> net

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
in the net

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.580 
in the net
remember<00:01:46.539> you've<00:01:46.659> got<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.929> hit<00:01:47.079> through<00:01:47.380> this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
remember you've got to hit through this

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.069 
remember you've got to hit through this
shot<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.069> want<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.310> keep<00:01:48.520> moving<00:01:49.119> as<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.659> hit

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
shot you want to keep moving as you hit

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.929 
shot you want to keep moving as you hit
so<00:01:50.619> when<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.799> come<00:01:50.979> up<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.280> hit<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.549> approach

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
so when you come up to hit the approach

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.039 
so when you come up to hit the approach
you<00:01:52.479> hit<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.929> don't<00:01:53.140> stop<00:01:53.500> keep<00:01:53.829> moving<00:01:53.860> in

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you hit it and don't stop keep moving in

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.260 
you hit it and don't stop keep moving in
now<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.110> other<00:01:56.439> reason<00:01:56.950> could<00:01:57.189> be<00:01:58.090> that

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
now the other reason could be that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.240 
now the other reason could be that
you're<00:01:58.450> chopping<00:01:58.929> down<00:01:59.140> too<00:01:59.470> severely<00:01:59.979> and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
you're chopping down too severely and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.160 
you're chopping down too severely and
the<00:02:00.580> racket<00:02:00.909> face<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.149> vertical<00:02:01.899> when<00:02:02.020> you're

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the racket face is vertical when you're

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.199 
the racket face is vertical when you're
hitting<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> ball<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:03.490> you're<00:02:03.610> starting<00:02:04.030> high

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
hitting the ball if you're starting high

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.580 
hitting the ball if you're starting high
and<00:02:04.390> you're<00:02:04.509> coming<00:02:04.810> down<00:02:05.020> with<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.319> vertical

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and you're coming down with a vertical

are<00:02:56.709> going<00:02:57.010> long<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.720> remember<00:02:59.080> that

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
are going long you have to remember that

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.920 
are going long you have to remember that
the<00:02:59.470> racket<00:02:59.830> face<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.069> only<00:03:00.459> open<00:03:01.030> 10<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.569> 20

the racket face is only open 10 to 20

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.830 
the racket face is only open 10 to 20
degrees<00:03:02.349> when<00:03:03.220> you're<00:03:03.340> making<00:03:03.700> contact<00:03:03.940> many

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
degrees when you're making contact many

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
degrees when you're making contact many
players<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.680> notion<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.430> racket

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
players have this notion that the racket

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.479 
players have this notion that the racket
is<00:03:06.910> laid-back<00:03:07.209> way<00:03:07.930> too<00:03:07.989> much<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.190> just

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
is laid-back way too much and that just

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.640 
is laid-back way too much and that just
simply<00:03:09.879> sends<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> ball<00:03:10.599> floating<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
simply sends the ball floating if the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.199 
simply sends the ball floating if the
rackets<00:03:12.040> laid-back<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.730> that

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
rackets laid-back like that

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.000 
rackets laid-back like that
the<00:03:13.720> ball<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.440> go<00:03:14.590> up<00:03:14.799> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the ball is just going to go up and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.729 
the ball is just going to go up and
float<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.660> have<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.080> think<00:03:17.349> consciously

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
float so you have to think consciously

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.880 
float so you have to think consciously
close<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.910> face<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.750> swing<00:03:20.049> forward<00:03:20.379> so

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
close the face as you swing forward so

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.580 
close the face as you swing forward so
as<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.190> swing<00:03:21.459> forward<00:03:21.900> close<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.349> face

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
as you swing forward close up the face

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.009 
as you swing forward close up the face
so<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:23.980> only<00:03:24.160> 10<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.940> 20<00:03:25.269> degrees<00:03:25.299> laid-back

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
so it's only 10 to 20 degrees laid-back

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.589 
so it's only 10 to 20 degrees laid-back
you<00:03:26.500> don't<00:03:26.680> want<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:26.920> be<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.599> now

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
you don't want to be like this now

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.539 
you don't want to be like this now
another<00:03:28.930> reason<00:03:29.230> may<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.769> you're<00:03:30.040> you're

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
another reason may be that you're you're

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.150 
another reason may be that you're you're
swinging<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.329> horizontal<00:03:32.049> remember<00:03:32.980> for

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
swinging to horizontal remember for

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.220 
swinging to horizontal remember for
every<00:03:33.549> degree<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.390> lay<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.810> racket

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
every degree that you lay the racket

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.920 
every degree that you lay the racket
back<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.250> have<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.670> increase<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.360> angle<00:03:37.540> at

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
back you have to increase the angle at

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.920 
back you have to increase the angle at
which<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.650> swing<00:03:39.010> down<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> if<00:03:40.329> you're<00:03:40.540> open

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
which you swing down so if you're open

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.470 
which you swing down so if you're open
10<00:03:41.170> or<00:03:41.290> 20<00:03:41.590> degrees<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.790> have<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:43.180> get<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
10 or 20 degrees you have to get the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.839 
10 or 20 degrees you have to get the
racket<00:03:43.870> up<00:03:44.049> you've<00:03:44.920> got<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.190> get<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> racket

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
racket up you've got to get the racket

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.900 
racket up you've got to get the racket
up<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.239> then<00:03:46.660> swing<00:03:47.079> down<00:03:47.410> as<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.430> hit<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
up and then swing down as you hit that

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.960 
up and then swing down as you hit that
will<00:03:49.690> tend<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.079> keep<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.440> ball<00:03:50.620> lower<00:03:50.970> now

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
will tend to keep the ball lower now

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.360 
will tend to keep the ball lower now
theoretically<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.840> could<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.010> racket

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
theoretically you could have the racket

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.289 
theoretically you could have the racket
face<00:03:54.549> open<00:03:55.060> say<00:03:55.540> 45<00:03:56.110> degrees<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:58.150> an

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
face open say 45 degrees on a on an

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.030 
face open say 45 degrees on a on an
approach<00:03:58.630> shot<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.620> means<00:03:59.829> you're

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
approach shot but that means you're

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.650 
approach shot but that means you're
gonna<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.549> increase<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.120> angle<00:04:01.510> now

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
gonna have to increase the angle now

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.720 
gonna have to increase the angle now
remember<00:04:02.200> every<00:04:02.470> degree<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.950> open<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.370> you

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
remember every degree you open it you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.819 
remember every degree you open it you
have<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.060> get<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.359> racket<00:04:04.720> up<00:04:04.870> higher<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.470> now

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
have to get the racket up higher so now

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.830 
have to get the racket up higher so now
you're<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.190> be<00:04:06.310> way<00:04:06.519> up<00:04:06.549> here<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.600> you're

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
you're going to be way up here if you're

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.710 
you're going to be way up here if you're
open<00:04:08.139> 45<00:04:08.650> degrees<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.880> you've<00:04:10.209> got<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.540> come

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
open 45 degrees and you've got to come

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.979 
open 45 degrees and you've got to come
down<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:12.220> remember<00:04:12.819> those<00:04:12.940> two<00:04:13.180> points<00:04:13.660> if

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
down so remember those two points if

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.420 
down so remember those two points if
you're<00:04:14.170> under<00:04:14.440> spin<00:04:14.680> approach<00:04:14.980> shots<00:04:15.250> are

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
you're under spin approach shots are
