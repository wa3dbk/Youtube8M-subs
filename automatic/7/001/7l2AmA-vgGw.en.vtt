00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.280
 folks 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.610
 I'm here to give you an important tip. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 for you 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.289
 I have this on youtube going things 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 talking about the alkalinity of the water 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:34.360
 is the water quality is a ph scale 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:38.590
 that goes from 0 to 14 7 is in the middle is a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.540
 neutral water neutral water in the country not well 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.050
 not bad after taking sava I may not 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.070
 happen will stay neutral in its 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.220
 body 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.770
 it works best quality 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.770
 so you have to drink some water 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.430
 of 70 has several videos explaining about 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.290
 this is not here on youtube on google you 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.070
 will find several things 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 only that what he chooses buys as 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.000
 turn water 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.649
 alkaline is sometimes incompatible with 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.210
 buy an expensive filter you have to 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:26.880
 to make such a process I will go to you 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:30.610
 today that I pretended it worked out is you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 go to your water filters the water 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.290
 Crystalline I can lose it not always 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.930
 because always another you took the chlorine 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.540
 some metals attending your child's 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.250
 Sir, it was good, only you did not test the ph. 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.409
 you do not know if he's alkaline water 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.110
 alkaline or if it is happening because 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.740
 below 7 to 0 and does very badly to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.509
 body does very badly is one is a 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.330
 door open for various diseases 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.080
 including cancer 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.099
 so what I did I tried several 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.750
 meter of one of the cheapest methods 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.200
 was with sodium bicarbonate 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 it will look good this will filter it out 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.670
 have a small spoon of coffee and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.209
 will put in here will shake and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.830
 will do a h test? 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.590
 You can buy at any store. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.800
 aquarium 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.720
 It's okay if I do not have a lot of moral 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.570
 sodium 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.690
 So I'm going to drink and I'll get my 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.910
 coach but it was doubt supergata what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.940
 I have no way to test the ph 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.190
 it will just boil your water 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.420
 if you lose your water she'll see how 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.680
 will stay with ph is between seven and a half is 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.489
 A quiet one for you to drink I'll give you 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.110
 love what I put the baking soda 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.580
 sodium carbonate, a spoonful of 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.750
 sodium 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.630
 Then you'll see if it stays zoomed. 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.340
 because it is a water fit for consumption 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.549
 I tested with tap water for now 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.299
 little by the yellow can not consume 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.299
 acid water 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.690
 I'm going to drip three drops of this 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.690
 reagent 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.490
 ready 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.240
 then the blue water means this water with 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.810
 ph above 7 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.940
 knows that details on leather 768 water theme 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.010
 photo with the consumption is a tip and 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.730
 practically for free you boil water and 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.780
 How cute is it to buy baking soda? 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.080
 of sodium 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.890
 using a little and spending little is 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.890
 tip and rolled
