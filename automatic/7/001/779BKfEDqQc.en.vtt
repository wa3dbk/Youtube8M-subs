00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.670
 of racing 2 the game sorry to be 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.670
 more accurate is a demo and if you get into 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.060
 the page of dead rising 2 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.070
 you can play for free just get yourself 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.830
 you put in the page you give to play the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.600
 demo and let you play as you can see 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.340
 I'm playing and right now I do not know which ones 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.990
 are the controls I do not know anything because 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.990
 I just played it, it's just started 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.720
 and I've never played this game 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.120
 zombies I'm looking to see to see what 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.940
 game to start playing 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.290
 and here I have come across this we are going to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.290
 try to see what things can be done 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.650
 I'm a little bit clumsy because I give it here 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.650
 to the s although it is not the s that is the e 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.020
 OK 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.380
 and what he puts in my English is pretty bad 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.520
 so nothing to see what it says is 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.120
 in ivory 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.800
 Here we have there is no flechita 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890
 I had seen her pointing us towards 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.530
 where do we have to go 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.400
 let's see what the switch 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.400
 we touch the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.990
 we jump still quickie 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.930

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.930
 how do I catch this the bat this hello 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.930
 it was stuck hitting with the action button 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.970
 mouse left mouse button takes 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.610

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.640

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.560
 [Music] 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 I do not know if I had to save someone or 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 something like that because I bet he's dead 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.040
 someone 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.670
 what of zombies 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.620

 that we get out of here I can not leave 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.590
 to see with the box is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.359
 I can not, I can not, they do not let me out 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.010

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.099
 when the first game that I play 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.420

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.420
