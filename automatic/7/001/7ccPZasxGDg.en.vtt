00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
absolutely a well laid out I believe and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.479 
absolutely a well laid out I believe and
and<00:03:47.079> one<00:03:47.980> last<00:03:48.250> thing<00:03:48.489> if<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.360> go<00:03:50.340> there<00:03:51.340> is

advanced but I believe that anybody can
use<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.700> system<00:04:06.910> which<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.920> basically<00:04:08.920> how<00:04:09.100> to

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
use the system which is basically how to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
use the system which is basically how to
drive<00:04:09.519> traffic<00:04:09.910> using<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.730> now<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.060> you

campaigns for something between one and
five<00:04:25.450> cents

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
five cents

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.430 
five cents
so<00:04:27.760> any<00:04:28.760> I've<00:04:29.090> used<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.420> before<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:29.990> very

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
so any I've used the before it's very

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.500 
so any I've used the before it's very
very<00:04:30.800> easy<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.900> use<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.460> very<00:04:34.460> it's<00:04:35.180> very<00:04:35.210> easy

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
very easy to use and very it's very easy

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
to track your campaigns and I think the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.370 
to track your campaigns and I think the
value<00:04:39.560> for<00:04:39.770> money<00:04:39.920> is<00:04:40.190> incredible<00:04:41.180> again<00:04:42.080> and

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
value for money is incredible again and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.360 
value for money is incredible again and
