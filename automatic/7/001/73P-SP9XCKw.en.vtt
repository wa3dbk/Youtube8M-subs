easily so I got two of those trying some
new<00:01:19.850> lean<00:01:20.850> hot<00:01:21.150> dogs<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.780> probably<00:01:22.590> gonna

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
new lean hot dogs here probably gonna

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.399 
new lean hot dogs here probably gonna
use<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.159> hot<00:01:23.549> dogs<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> beans<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.259> I'm

use these for hot dogs and beans so I'm

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
use these for hot dogs and beans so I'm
gonna<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> beans<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:26.610> source<00:01:26.850> of

fiber<00:01:27.180> good<00:01:28.049> source<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> protein<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
fiber good source of protein and then I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
fiber good source of protein and then I
found<00:01:29.909> these<00:01:30.180> guys<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:31.020> sure<00:01:31.290> how

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
they're gonna taste but then pretty good

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.789 
they're gonna taste but then pretty good
macros<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.450> got<00:01:36.450> 50<00:01:36.900> calories<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
macros here got 50 calories two and a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.940 
macros here got 50 calories two and a
half<00:01:37.979> fat<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.700> carbs<00:01:39.150> five<00:01:39.810> protein<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> one

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
half fat for carbs five protein and one

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
half fat for carbs five protein and one
of<00:01:41.040> these<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.790> better<00:01:42.030> macros<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> actual

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
of these so way better macros and actual

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
of these so way better macros and actual
hot<00:01:43.229> dogs<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.880> they'll<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.090> pretty

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
hot dogs and I think they'll be pretty

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.690 
hot dogs and I think they'll be pretty
good<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.869> hot<00:01:46.140> dogs<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.680> baked<00:01:46.829> beans<00:01:48.049> next<00:01:49.049> up

fresh<00:02:17.270> chicken<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:19.280> sure<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:19.760> exactly<00:02:19.880> I'm

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
fresh chicken not sure what exactly I'm

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.090 
fresh chicken not sure what exactly I'm
going<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.930> yet<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.350> obviously

a<00:02:22.130> good<00:02:22.280> protein<00:02:22.850> source<00:02:22.910> now<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:25.489> is

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
a good protein source now this this is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.460 
a good protein source now this this is
something<00:02:26.000> I'm<00:02:26.239> excited<00:02:26.750> about<00:02:26.810> I've

a whole bunch of ice cream in here

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.289 
a whole bunch of ice cream in here
because<00:03:09.769> they<00:03:09.860> usually<00:03:10.130> finish<00:03:10.940> off<00:03:11.090> my

in one of my full day of flexible
dieting<00:03:18.380> videos<00:03:18.859> pretty<00:03:19.640> good<00:03:19.790> macros

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
dieting videos pretty good macros

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.110 
dieting videos pretty good macros
there's<00:03:21.079> four<00:03:21.440> servings<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.549> tub<00:03:22.790> and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
there's four servings in a tub and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.150 
there's four servings in a tub and
you've<00:03:23.390> got<00:03:23.540> three<00:03:23.900> fat<00:03:24.140> thirty-eight<00:03:24.709> carbs

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
you've got three fat thirty-eight carbs

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.699 
you've got three fat thirty-eight carbs
six<00:03:25.489> protein<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:26.630> per<00:03:26.900> serving<00:03:27.500> and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
six protein and this one per serving and

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.030 
six protein and this one per serving and
then<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:29.000> also<00:03:29.150> got<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.480> Cherry<00:03:29.930> Garcia<00:03:30.109> one<00:03:30.769> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
then I also got a Cherry Garcia one and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.580 
then I also got a Cherry Garcia one and
this<00:03:31.459> has<00:03:31.700> even<00:03:31.910> better<00:03:32.239> macros<00:03:32.870> even<00:03:33.290> higher

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
this has even better macros even higher

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.650 
this has even better macros even higher
protein<00:03:34.540> got<00:03:35.540> three<00:03:35.959> fat<00:03:36.340> 37<00:03:37.340> carbs<00:03:37.850> eight

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
protein got three fat 37 carbs eight

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.380 
protein got three fat 37 carbs eight
protein<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.739> one's<00:03:39.890> even<00:03:40.040> better<00:03:40.390> and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
protein so that one's even better and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.620 
protein so that one's even better and
then<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.959> just<00:03:42.440> got<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:42.739> staple<00:03:43.329> eating<00:03:44.329> slow

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
then I just got my staple eating slow

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.539 
then I just got my staple eating slow
churn<00:03:44.930> can't<00:03:45.709> get<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:45.890> out<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.130> bag<00:03:46.310> though

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
churn can't get it out of the bag though

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.520 
churn can't get it out of the bag though
you<00:03:47.269> guys<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.660> seen<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.079> million<00:03:48.350> times

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
again pretty good macros overall I

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.130 
again pretty good macros overall I
really<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.820> using<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.750> do<00:03:53.810> make

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
really like using this if I do make

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.199 
really like using this if I do make
protein<00:03:54.680> shakes<00:03:55.069> it's<00:03:55.430> kind<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.700> my<00:03:55.819> preferred

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
protein shakes it's kind of my preferred

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.590 
protein shakes it's kind of my preferred
way<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.420> making<00:03:56.930> them<00:03:57.609> next<00:03:58.609> up<00:03:58.910> I've<00:03:59.329> got<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
way of making them next up I've got the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.170 
way of making them next up I've got the

tastes like sour patch kids but like

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.940 
tastes like sour patch kids but like
most<00:06:18.250> good<00:06:18.940> gums<00:06:19.690> that<00:06:19.960> lasts<00:06:20.410> like<00:06:20.530> five
