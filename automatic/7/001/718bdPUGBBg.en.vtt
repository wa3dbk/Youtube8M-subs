welcome<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.500> digital<00:00:01.650> toolbox<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.730> Scott<00:00:03.149> and

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
welcome to digital toolbox I'm Scott and

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.329 
welcome to digital toolbox I'm Scott and
in<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.689> tutorial<00:00:03.870> we're<00:00:04.230> gonna<00:00:04.319> go<00:00:04.620> over<00:00:04.950> the

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
in this tutorial we're gonna go over the

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.810 
in this tutorial we're gonna go over the
benefits<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.390> range<00:00:06.690> vs.<00:00:07.379> series<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
benefits of a range vs. series so a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.990 
benefits of a range vs. series so a
range<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.380> very<00:00:10.380> basic<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.160> asked<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
range is very basic it just asked for a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.079 
range is very basic it just asked for a
set<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.480> numbers<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.230> domain<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.910> can

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
set of numbers the domain and that can

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.529 
set of numbers the domain and that can
be<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.839> starts<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.289> 0<00:00:16.650> by<00:00:17.490> default<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
be it starts at 0 by default but and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
be it starts at 0 by default but and
then<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> throw<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.500> 25<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.490> it'll<00:00:20.730> go

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
then you throw in a 25 and then it'll go

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.349 
then you throw in a 25 and then it'll go
from<00:00:21.439> 0<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> 25<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.880> run<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.119> through<00:00:24.150> an

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
from 0 to 25 if you run it through an

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.830 
from 0 to 25 if you run it through an
interval<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.099> specify<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
interval then you can specify a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.529 
interval then you can specify a
different<00:00:27.840> lower<00:00:28.740> bound<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.849> we'd<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.240> 10

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
different lower bound so if we'd say 10

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.889 
different lower bound so if we'd say 10
to<00:00:30.810> 25<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:32.040> goes<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.340> 10<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> 25<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.360> then

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to 25 it goes from 10 to 25 and then

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.040 
to 25 it goes from 10 to 25 and then
it's<00:00:34.050> broken<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.590> into<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:35.340> series<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:35.969> steps<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's broken up into a series of steps so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.000 
it's broken up into a series of steps so
n<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.100> number<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> steps<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:40.010> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
n is a the number of steps and then it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
n is a the number of steps and then it
will<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.610> create<00:00:41.940> those<00:00:42.629> intervals<00:00:43.200> based

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
will just create those intervals based

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
will just create those intervals based
on<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:44.070> many<00:00:44.219> ever<00:00:44.340> many<00:00:44.579> steps<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.379> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on how many ever many steps you want so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
on how many ever many steps you want so
this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.559> great<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> define<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this is great if you want to define a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690 
this is great if you want to define a
specific<00:00:48.750> number<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.050> steps<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
specific number of steps but and you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
specific number of steps but and you
don't<00:00:50.879> care<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> actual<00:00:52.980> increment

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
don't care what the the actual increment

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
don't care what the the actual increment
is<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.969> long<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.680> that's<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
is as long as it's even so that's the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.520 
is as long as it's even so that's the
range<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> series<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.410> bit

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
range the series is a little bit

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
range the series is a little bit
different<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> asks<00:00:59.820> for<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.079> first

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
different it asks for the the first

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.910 
different it asks for the the first
number<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> series<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.049> that<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.650> 0

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
number in the series and that can be 0

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.050 
number in the series and that can be 0
can<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.129> whatever<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> can

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
can be whatever you want so you can

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.929 
can be whatever you want so you can
define<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> ahead<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:08.280> asks<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.610> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
define that ahead of time it asks for in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.620 
define that ahead of time it asks for in
the<00:01:09.570> step<00:01:10.229> size<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the step size so this one is for if you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
the step size so this one is for if you
do<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> specify<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.100> step<00:01:14.460> size<00:01:14.640> we'll

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
do want to specify a step size we'll

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.920 
do want to specify a step size we'll
look<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:17.570> just<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.720> one

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
look at just this one just this one

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
look at just this one just this one
series<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.040> step<00:01:20.340> size<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.640> 10<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.390> bring

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
series so step size is 10 we can bring

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.370 
series so step size is 10 we can bring
it<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.650> it'll<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.860> 7<00:01:23.220> 14<00:01:23.850> 21<00:01:23.880> 28<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it down so it'll go 7 14 21 28 if you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.810 
it down so it'll go 7 14 21 28 if you
specify<00:01:25.590> 7<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> number<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
specify 7 and then see is the number of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.560 
specify 7 and then see is the number of
steps<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.450> number<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> values<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.310> 0<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.000> 9<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
steps the number of values so 0 to 9 it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
steps the number of values so 0 to 9 it
always<00:01:33.689> starts<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.049> 0<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.610> 10<00:01:35.610> 10<00:01:36.420> items<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:37.560> be

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
always starts at 0 is 10 10 items can be

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
always starts at 0 is 10 10 items can be
less<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.270> if<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:40.350> use<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.850> interval

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
less or more if you use the interval

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.050 
less or more if you use the interval
with<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.540> series<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:44.250> series<00:01:44.670> perhaps

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
with the series or two series perhaps

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.289 
with the series or two series perhaps
you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:46.880> specify<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.829> series<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.610> certain

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you can specify a series with certain

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.350 
you can specify a series with certain
intervals<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.720> 0<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> 10<00:01:55.170> 7<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
intervals so here we have 0 to 10 7 to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
intervals so here we have 0 to 10 7 to
2014<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.479> 30<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.649> tweak<00:01:58.860> these

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
2014 to 30 and then you can tweak these

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.780 
2014 to 30 and then you can tweak these
values<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.719> different<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.399> correct

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
values to get different the correct

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.420 
values to get different the correct
interval<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> want<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:04.920> 0

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
interval that you want so if we want 0

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.930 
interval that you want so if we want 0
to<00:02:05.549> 10<00:02:05.759> 10<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.329> 20<00:02:06.390> 20<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.229> 30<00:02:07.500> 30<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> 40<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.819> we

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 then we

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.190 
to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 then we
could<00:02:09.090> begin<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> highlight<00:02:09.780> specific

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
could begin to highlight specific

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.480 
could begin to highlight specific
numbers<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
numbers of a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.350 
numbers of a
a set<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> values<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.540> were<00:02:12.900> working<00:02:13.770> with

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
a set of values that were working with

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.250 
a set of values that were working with
so<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> basic<00:02:15.960> difference<00:02:15.990> between

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so that's the basic difference between

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
so that's the basic difference between
the<00:02:16.530> range<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> series<00:02:17.580> hope<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.420> learn

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the range in the series hope you learn

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.900 
the range in the series hope you learn
something
