00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
nothing and then after that I did a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.050 
nothing and then after that I did a
daily<00:01:49.110> minimum<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> bench<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.280> 315<00:01:50.880> for

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
daily minimum on the bench with 315 for

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.740 
daily minimum on the bench with 315 for
a<00:01:51.090> long<00:01:51.270> pause<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.740> super<00:01:53.460> easy<00:01:53.750> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a long pause and that was super easy so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
a long pause and that was super easy so
I<00:01:54.780> pretty<00:01:55.619> much<00:01:55.860> worked<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.700> an

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I pretty much worked out for about an

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.310 
I pretty much worked out for about an
hour<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> half<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.600> body<00:01:57.840> feels<00:01:58.020> good

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
hour and a half and my body feels good

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
hour and a half and my body feels good
cuz<00:01:58.759> I'm<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.790> doing<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.240> these<00:02:00.360> new<00:02:00.540> things

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
cuz I'm just doing all these new things

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
cuz I'm just doing all these new things
and<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> refreshes<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.520> psychology

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and it kind of refreshes my psychology

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.510 
and it kind of refreshes my psychology
and<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:05.070> thing<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and all of that and one thing I want to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639 
and all of that and one thing I want to
talk<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> guys<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.780> fuel<00:02:07.320> shaker

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
talk to you guys about is a fuel shaker

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.430 
talk to you guys about is a fuel shaker
sent<00:02:08.610> me<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.330> protein<00:02:09.810> bottle<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.319> i

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
sent me this protein bottle which i

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
sent me this protein bottle which i
think<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.920> our<00:02:11.099> protein<00:02:11.430> shaker<00:02:11.670> bottle<00:02:11.910> which

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
think is our protein shaker bottle which

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.450 
think is our protein shaker bottle which
i<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.569> soup

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
i think is soup

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.820 
i think is soup
because<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.360> usually<00:02:14.690> carry<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.440> three<00:02:15.680> or

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
because I usually carry like three or

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.330 
because I usually carry like three or
four<00:02:16.210> protein<00:02:17.210> shakers<00:02:17.860> because<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.160> one

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
four protein shakers because I have one

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.220 
four protein shakers because I have one
from<00:02:19.520> my<00:02:19.730> protein<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.660> have<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.020> for<00:02:21.170> my

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
from my protein and I have one for my

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
from my protein and I have one for my
BCAA<00:02:21.740> sometimes<00:02:22.340> I'll<00:02:22.460> have<00:02:22.580> one<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
BCAA sometimes I'll have one for a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.570 
BCAA sometimes I'll have one for a
pre-workout<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.750> my<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.170> really<00:02:24.800> down

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
pre-workout on my really really down

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.300 
pre-workout on my really really down
days<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.540> what's<00:02:26.750> cool<00:02:26.960> about<00:02:27.020> fuel<00:02:27.650> shaker<00:02:27.920> is

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
days so what's cool about fuel shaker is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.400 
days so what's cool about fuel shaker is
that<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.090> carry<00:02:29.360> multiple<00:02:29.600> cartridges

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
that you can carry multiple cartridges

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.810 
that you can carry multiple cartridges
and<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.710> one<00:02:30.860> has<00:02:30.950> protein<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.430> it

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and this one has protein in it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940 
and this one has protein in it
and<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.150> could<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.330> put<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> then

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
and I could just put it in here and then

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.620 
and I could just put it in here and then
close<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:37.270> geez<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
close it like this and then geez and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.680 
close it like this and then geez and
then<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.870> could<00:02:39.020> just<00:02:39.230> pop<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.300> goes<00:02:41.480> in

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
then I could just pop it it just goes in

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.970 
then I could just pop it it just goes in
and<00:02:41.810> there's<00:02:41.960> an<00:02:42.050> already<00:02:42.290> built<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.650> shaker

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and there's an already built in shaker

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.330 
and there's an already built in shaker
so<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> can<00:02:44.090> shake<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.390> up<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.070> then<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.100> can

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
so now I can shake it up and then I can

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.860 
so now I can shake it up and then I can
have<00:02:46.490> my<00:02:46.760> own<00:02:46.790> wedding<00:02:47.060> clothes<00:02:47.330> antenna<00:02:47.600> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
have my own wedding clothes antenna I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.870 
have my own wedding clothes antenna I
can<00:02:48.530> shake<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:48.860> up<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:49.370> now<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.520> have<00:02:49.640> my

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
can shake it up and then now I have my

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.370 
can shake it up and then now I have my
protein<00:02:50.390> drink<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> use<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.020> multiple

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
protein drink and I use that multiple

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.050 
protein drink and I use that multiple
cartridges<00:02:51.920> which<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.520> really<00:02:52.730> cool<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:52.970> think

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
cartridges which is really cool I think

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.430 
cartridges which is really cool I think
it's<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.300> really<00:02:53.510> cool<00:02:53.660> product<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.170> those<00:02:54.320> of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
it's a really cool product but those of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.010 
it's a really cool product but those of
you<00:02:54.530> guys<00:02:54.650> who<00:02:55.010> are<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:55.490> me<00:02:55.760> who<00:02:56.360> work<00:02:56.570> out<00:02:56.780> on

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
you guys who are like me who work out on

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.360 
you guys who are like me who work out on
the<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.320> sometimes<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.040> time<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.280> go

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the go sometimes you have time to go

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.980 
the go sometimes you have time to go
home<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.970> have<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.210> take<00:02:59.390> all<00:02:59.600> kinds<00:02:59.780> of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
home and you have to take all kinds of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.500 
home and you have to take all kinds of
weird<00:03:00.170> stuff<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> right<00:03:02.210> here<00:03:02.360> good

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
weird stuff this is it right here good

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.730 
weird stuff this is it right here good
after<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.990> could<00:03:03.140> drink<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.470> they're

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
after this I could drink this they're

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.530 
after this I could drink this they're
not<00:03:03.860> gonna<00:03:03.950> put<00:03:04.130> another<00:03:04.220> BCA's<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.060> here<00:03:05.210> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
not gonna put another BCA's in here and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.630 
not gonna put another BCA's in here and
stay<00:03:05.750> hydrated<00:03:05.960> throughout<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.650> day<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.460> is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
stay hydrated throughout the day this is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.190 
stay hydrated throughout the day this is
probably<00:03:07.850> nasty<00:03:08.210> though<00:03:08.330> comes<00:03:08.600> with<00:03:08.750> BCA's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
probably nasty though comes with BCA's

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500 
probably nasty though comes with BCA's
and<00:03:09.530> protein<00:03:10.520> but<00:03:10.640> if<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:10.880> into<00:03:11.300> like

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
and protein but if you're into like

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.680 
and protein but if you're into like
mango<00:03:11.990> chocolate<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.300> probably<00:03:14.540> gonna

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
mango chocolate this is probably gonna

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.240 
mango chocolate this is probably gonna
be<00:03:14.810> really<00:03:14.960> delicious<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.560> that's<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.040> that
