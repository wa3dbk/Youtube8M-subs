a<00:01:33.210> tweak<00:01:33.479> called<00:01:33.509> custom<00:01:34.200> no<00:01:34.409> news<00:01:34.650> label<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
a tweak called custom no news label this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
a tweak called custom no news label this

allows you to customize the text and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
allows you to customize the text and
notification<00:01:37.950> center<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> says<00:01:38.579> no<00:01:39.060> new

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
notification center that says no new

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
notification center that says no new
notifications<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.860> weird<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
notifications which is kind of weird to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
notifications which is kind of weird to
be<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.450> example<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
be there but for example I just have it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
be there but for example I just have it
saying<00:01:43.560> Adam<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
saying Adam and that's it right there so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
saying Adam and that's it right there so
it's<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.439> custom<00:01:46.860> nll<00:01:47.579> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it's right here which is custom nll you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.429 
it's right here which is custom nll you
click<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> guys<00:01:49.200> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
click on that and then you guys can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
color so it's pretty simple you have

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620 
color so it's pretty simple you have
your<00:01:52.560> RGB<00:01:52.799> values<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.540> know

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
live update right there and then you can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929

is pretty awesome tweak and it allows
you<00:02:09.360> guys<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.840> automatically<00:02:10.500> scroll<00:02:10.920> using

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you guys to automatically scroll using

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.150 
you guys to automatically scroll using
your<00:02:11.849> volume<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.870> down

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
your volume up and down

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250 
your volume up and down
so<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:13.880> example<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.210> i<00:02:14.300> press<00:02:14.540> down<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.080> hold

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
the bigboss repo finally I have a tweet

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.910 
the bigboss repo finally I have a tweet
that<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.360> made<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> video<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.080> couple<00:02:36.530> months<00:02:36.770> ago

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that I made a video on couple months ago

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.220 
that I made a video on couple months ago
but<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.700> updated<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.300> iOS<00:02:38.720> 5<00:02:38.960> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
but it was just updated to iOS 5 and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.050 
but it was just updated to iOS 5 and
this<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> tweak<00:02:39.920> called<00:02:39.950> apps<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.820> and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
this is a tweak called apps that and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.700 
this is a tweak called apps that and
what<00:02:41.210> this<00:02:41.330> does<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.720> tracks<00:02:42.080> how<00:02:42.470> long

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
what this does is it tracks how long

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.520 
what this does is it tracks how long
you've<00:02:42.920> been<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.190> each<00:02:43.580> iOS<00:02:44.180> application<00:02:44.810> so

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
you've been in each iOS application so

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.290 
you've been in each iOS application so
for<00:02:45.890> example<00:02:45.950> I've<00:02:46.460> been<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.790> settings<00:02:47.120> for

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
for example I've been in settings for

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.790 
for example I've been in settings for
two<00:02:47.420> minutes<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.870> clicked<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.260> 13<00:02:48.770> times

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
two minutes I clicked on it 13 times

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.400 
two minutes I clicked on it 13 times
I've<00:02:49.460> been<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.850> male<00:02:50.060> 40<00:02:50.360> seconds<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.200> clicked

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
I've been in male 40 seconds I clicked

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.900 
I've been in male 40 seconds I clicked
on<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.560> nine<00:02:51.980> times<00:02:52.310> which<00:02:52.550> doesn't<00:02:52.850> really

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
on it nine times which doesn't really

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.870 
on it nine times which doesn't really
make<00:02:53.090> sense<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:54.200> clicked<00:02:54.710> on<00:02:54.800> Cydia<00:02:55.220> six<00:02:55.640> times

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
make sense I clicked on Cydia six times

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.360 
make sense I clicked on Cydia six times
