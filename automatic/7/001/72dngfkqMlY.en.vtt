00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to make it appeal all more to kids and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.289 
to make it appeal all more to kids and
I'm<00:01:42.930> 1086<00:01:43.409> definitely<00:01:44.030> nowadays<00:01:45.030> they

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I'm 1086 definitely nowadays they

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960

probably<00:01:45.509> probably<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.250> back

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
probably probably not be that but back

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.399 
probably probably not be that but back
then<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:48.780> assume<00:01:49.079> they'd<00:01:49.259> have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
then I kind of would assume they'd have

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.649 
then I kind of would assume they'd have
done<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.790> didn't<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
done that but they didn't all like one
