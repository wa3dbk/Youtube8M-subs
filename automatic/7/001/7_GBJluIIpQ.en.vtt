okay<00:00:02.850> so<00:00:02.909> now<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.270> drawbacks<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.050> LED<00:00:04.319> lights

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:04.590 
okay so now the drawbacks to LED lights

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so now the drawbacks to LED lights
well<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.130> first<00:00:05.340> thing<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:05.580> know<00:00:05.760> if<00:00:06.510> you've

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
well the first thing you know if you've

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.810 
well the first thing you know if you've
gone<00:00:07.200> shopping<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.769> LED<00:00:08.040> lights<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.550> that

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
gone shopping for LED lights is that

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.310 
gone shopping for LED lights is that
they<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.300> expensive<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.349> not<00:00:10.709> cheap

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
they are expensive they are not cheap

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.060 
they are expensive they are not cheap
for<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:14.099> 1k<00:00:14.400> light<00:00:14.879> I<00:00:15.240> think<00:00:15.870> runs<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.010> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
for this 1k light I think runs about a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.810 
for this 1k light I think runs about a
thousand<00:00:17.520> dollars<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.060> battery<00:00:18.300> mount

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
thousand dollars with the battery mount

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.010 
thousand dollars with the battery mount
for<00:00:20.820> these<00:00:21.530> light<00:00:22.530> panel<00:00:23.060> bricks<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.390> think

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
for these light panel bricks I think

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.210 
for these light panel bricks I think
you're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.290> to<00:00:25.350> spend<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.040> same

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you're going to spend about the same

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
you're going to spend about the same
amount<00:00:26.660> these<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.780> our<00:00:27.900> high<00:00:28.050> quality<00:00:28.080> build

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
amount these are our high quality build

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.400 
amount these are our high quality build
so<00:00:29.330> they<00:00:30.330> are<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.480> cheap<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:33.170> LED<00:00:34.170> lights

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so they are not cheap but LED lights

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
so they are not cheap but LED lights
will<00:00:34.679> last<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.129> don't<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> change<00:00:35.640> bulbs<00:00:35.969> as

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
will last you don't to change bulbs as

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750 
will last you don't to change bulbs as
much<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.100> there's<00:00:38.280> some<00:00:38.429> trade<00:00:38.609> off

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
much so you know there's some trade off

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360 
much so you know there's some trade off
with<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> cost<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:40.019> portability<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.190> low

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
with the cost the portability the low

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.029 
with the cost the portability the low
heat<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.909> low<00:00:42.030> power<00:00:42.269> consumption<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
heat the low power consumption all that

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.770 
heat the low power consumption all that
comes<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.519> price<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.909> pay<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.359> mean<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
comes at a price to pay so I mean you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.079 
comes at a price to pay so I mean you
have<00:00:45.929> to<00:00:46.050> justify<00:00:46.730> spending<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> extra

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
have to justify spending the extra

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.139 
have to justify spending the extra
expense<00:00:48.359> but<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.949> drawback<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.999> going

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
expense but as a drawback you're going

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.020 
expense but as a drawback you're going
to<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.420> notice<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.409> expensive

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
to first notice they are more expensive

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.729 
to first notice they are more expensive
many<00:00:54.030> models<00:00:54.390> especially<00:00:55.219> like<00:00:56.219> these<00:00:56.399> 1k

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
many models especially like these 1k

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.029 
many models especially like these 1k
these<00:00:58.739> 1k<00:00:59.129> panels<00:01:00.589> you<00:01:01.589> have<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.889> get

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
an all-around wash light now I can dim

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
an all-around wash light now I can dim
it<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.290> fully<00:01:16.560> dimmable<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.950> goes<00:01:20.100> all

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it it is fully dimmable and it goes all

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.120 
it it is fully dimmable and it goes all
the<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.399> up<00:01:20.579> i<00:01:21.229> also<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.409> banks<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the way up i also have banks that i can

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
the way up i also have banks that i can
turn<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.640> off<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.140> down

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
to just one bank and then it's off so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.380 
to just one bank and then it's off so
you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.219> have<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.670> flexibility<00:01:33.180> with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you know I do have some flexibility with

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.370 
you know I do have some flexibility with
like<00:01:33.539> but<00:01:34.070> like<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.219> said<00:01:35.780> usually<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.200> want

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like but like I said usually if you want

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.800 
like but like I said usually if you want
a<00:01:37.469> spot<00:01:38.390> for<00:01:39.390> nails<00:01:39.539> are<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:39.899> than<00:01:40.740> LEDs<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
a spot for nails are better than LEDs so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.469 
a spot for nails are better than LEDs so
that<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> drawbacks<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:44.479> LED

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that is one of the drawbacks to LED

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.950 
that is one of the drawbacks to LED
lights<00:01:46.490> another<00:01:47.490> drawback<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.719> these

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
lights another drawback is that these

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.969 
lights another drawback is that these
tiny<00:01:49.320> bulbs<00:01:49.969> one<00:01:50.969> goes<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.799> you're<00:01:52.799> kind

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
tiny bulbs one goes out and you're kind

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.270 
tiny bulbs one goes out and you're kind
of<00:01:53.009> doomed<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:55.679> know<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.950> least<00:01:55.979> with

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of doomed so you know at least with

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.510 
of doomed so you know at least with
furnell<00:01:57.060> lights<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.049> hm<00:01:58.920> eyes<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.369> know<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
furnell lights and hm eyes you know you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.389 
furnell lights and hm eyes you know you
best<00:02:00.179> of<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.840> place<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> bulb<00:02:01.409> these

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
best of all your place to bulb these

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.969 
best of all your place to bulb these
once<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.479> go<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.049> they're<00:02:04.469> very<00:02:04.740> very

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
once they go out there they're very very

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.249 
once they go out there they're very very
difficult<00:02:05.249> to<00:02:05.579> change<00:02:05.789> some<00:02:06.509> companies<00:02:06.960> might

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
difficult to change some companies might

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
difficult to change some companies might
you<00:02:08.070> know<00:02:08.220> warranty<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.970> bulbs<00:02:10.039> most<00:02:11.039> don't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
you know warranty the bulbs most don't

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.449 
you know warranty the bulbs most don't
so<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:12.989> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.200> stuck<00:02:13.349> once<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.250> bulbs

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
so you're kind of stuck once the bulbs

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.050 
so you're kind of stuck once the bulbs
go<00:02:14.580> out

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
go out

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.020 
go out
you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:16.319> out<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.890> lights<00:02:17.099> done<00:02:17.370> now

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you know they go out the lights done now

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.130 
you know they go out the lights done now
the<00:02:18.870> life<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.680> bowl<00:02:20.120> these<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.660> don't

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the life of the bowl these I don't

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.290 
the life of the bowl these I don't
remember<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> exact<00:02:22.800> total<00:02:23.580> life<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.090> these

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
remember the exact total life of these

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.030 
remember the exact total life of these
but<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> did<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.380> little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.830> math

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but I kind of did a little bit of math

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080 
but I kind of did a little bit of math
and<00:02:26.370> basically<00:02:27.030> I'd<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.900> run<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:29.090> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and basically I'd have to run this at a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.559 
and basically I'd have to run this at a
full<00:02:30.870> brightness<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:32.220> seven<00:02:32.670> years<00:02:33.030> before

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
full brightness for seven years before

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.430 
full brightness for seven years before
the<00:02:34.530> end<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.890> lifespan<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.459> these<00:02:35.730> bulbs

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the end of the lifespan of these bulbs

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
the end of the lifespan of these bulbs
chances<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.590> that's<00:02:37.769> not<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.250> happen

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
chances are that's not going to happen

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.790 
chances are that's not going to happen
chances<00:02:39.390> are<00:02:39.569> technology<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.230> catch<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
chances are technology will catch up and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.229 
chances are technology will catch up and
i'll<00:02:41.220> probably<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.580> different<00:02:41.910> lights<00:02:42.090> by

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
i'll probably have different lights by

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.339 
i'll probably have different lights by
then<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.019> realistically<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.810> life<00:02:46.080> of

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
then so realistically it's the life of

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.670 
then so realistically it's the life of
these<00:02:46.470> bulbs<00:02:46.709> are<00:02:46.980> pretty<00:02:47.549> extensive<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
these bulbs are pretty extensive and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.509 
these bulbs are pretty extensive and
really<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> only<00:02:49.860> thing<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> worry

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
really the only thing you have to worry

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.340 
really the only thing you have to worry
about<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.880> breaking<00:02:51.390> them<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:53.120> that's<00:02:54.350> you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
about is breaking them and that's you

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.809 
about is breaking them and that's you
know<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:55.830> long<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.160> you're<00:02:56.280> careful<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.700> your

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
know as long as you're careful with your

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.910 
know as long as you're careful with your
your<00:02:57.299> equipment<00:02:57.720> that's<00:02:58.350> probably<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.769> going

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
your equipment that's probably not going

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.059 
your equipment that's probably not going
to<00:02:59.010> happen<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.900> one<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> last<00:03:01.349> things<00:03:01.500> I

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
to happen and one of the last things I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.620 
to happen and one of the last things I
want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> talk<00:03:02.489> about<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:03.030> far<00:03:03.239> as<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
want to talk about as far as the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.120 
want to talk about as far as the
drawbacks<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.140> LED<00:03:04.410> lights<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.799> I've

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
drawbacks to LED lights that I've

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.870 
drawbacks to LED lights that I've
personally<00:03:06.440> noticed<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.069> i<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> hard

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
personally noticed is that i have a hard

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.650 
personally noticed is that i have a hard
time<00:03:09.120> when<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.390> need<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.660> mix<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.170> lights<00:03:11.660> by

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
time when I need to mix the lights by

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.520 
time when I need to mix the lights by
default<00:03:13.200> most<00:03:13.530> LED<00:03:13.920> panels<00:03:14.340> they<00:03:14.760> come<00:03:15.440> one<00:03:16.440> or

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
default most LED panels they come one or

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.090 
default most LED panels they come one or
two<00:03:16.680> ways<00:03:16.830> either<00:03:16.860> they're<00:03:17.660> tungsten<00:03:19.100> or

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
two ways either they're tungsten or

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.140 
two ways either they're tungsten or
their<00:03:20.880> daylight<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.519> what<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.549> found<00:03:23.609> its

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
their daylight and so what I found its

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
their daylight and so what I found its
best<00:03:24.510> when<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.140> total<00:03:25.500> control<00:03:25.620> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
best when you can have total control of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.990 
best when you can have total control of
your<00:03:26.160> rear<00:03:26.519> lighting<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:28.250> either<00:03:29.250> use<00:03:29.609> all

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
your rear lighting you either use all

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.699 
your rear lighting you either use all
daylight<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.440> use<00:03:31.709> tungsten<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:34.470> very

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
daylight or you use tungsten it's very

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.870 
daylight or you use tungsten it's very
difficult<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.549> mix<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.569> match<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:38.370> get<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> lot

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
difficult to mix and match you get a lot

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.539 
difficult to mix and match you get a lot
of<00:03:38.910> different<00:03:39.390> weird<00:03:39.630> flesh<00:03:39.959> tones<00:03:40.430> even<00:03:41.430> if

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
of different weird flesh tones even if

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.180 
of different weird flesh tones even if
it's<00:03:41.700> intentional<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.980> wouldn't

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it's intentional I just wouldn't

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.800 
it's intentional I just wouldn't
recommend<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.609> with<00:03:44.730> LED<00:03:45.030> lights<00:03:45.060> usually<00:03:45.750> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
recommend it with LED lights usually you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.539 
recommend it with LED lights usually you
can<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:45.989> by<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.200> with<00:03:46.980> tungsten<00:03:47.190> lighting

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
can get by that with tungsten lighting

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.479 
can get by that with tungsten lighting
because<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.120> gel<00:03:48.359> them<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:49.859> do

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
because you can gel them and you can do

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.800 
because you can gel them and you can do
different<00:03:50.639> things<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
different things with it you can have a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.750 
different things with it you can have a
contrast<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.829> different<00:03:53.100> types<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.400> lot<00:03:53.549> of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
contrast of different types a lot of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.990 
contrast of different types a lot of
lighting<00:03:54.150> these<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.380> you're<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> use<00:03:56.130> if

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
lighting these if you're going to use if

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.250 
lighting these if you're going to use if
you're<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.299> light<00:03:57.420> an<00:03:57.569> interior<00:03:58.049> and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
you're going to light an interior and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.809 
you're going to light an interior and
you<00:03:58.319> want<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.560> use<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:59.220> know<00:03:59.310> some<00:03:59.549> window

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
you want to use you know some window

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.199 
you want to use you know some window
light<00:04:00.000> then<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.480> suggest<00:04:00.690> sticking<00:04:01.590> with

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
light then I suggest sticking with

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.139 
light then I suggest sticking with
daylight<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.450> these<00:04:03.690> LEDs
