 [Music] 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.450
 so hello I will introduce you to the 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.869
 latest innovation in 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.090
 of connected objects from sony mobile 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.619
 the smartphone the smart benz presents itself 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.360
 in the form of a bracelet in 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 rubber tuning that is a real 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.250
 accessory so on this presentation 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.859
 where you will be able 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.319
 in any case, we will be able to visualize 3 3 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.640
 specific features of the 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.479
 mardaing so the first thing that's 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.339
 that indeed it is a 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.530
 fashion accessory and we have it 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.199
 perfect illustration here on this pole 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.059
 from experience we see that it is going to be 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.829
 available as well for men 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.510
 than for women under different 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.609
 sizes and compare one will be able 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.859
 accessorized in different forms 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.199
 there for example something quite 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.489
 nice is we can insert 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.440
 so the module since the smartphone is 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.379
 composed of a support that can 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.210
 welcome a smart module that is 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.420
 this one so this smart module 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 called the body-to-body we are going 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 to be able to recharge here thanks to a port 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.910
 micro usb that we will be able to come 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.310
 integrate another accessory so 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.710
 very simple we will be able to integrate it 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.840
 so to this rubber bracelet but 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.390
 so also be able to integrate it either to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 a ring whether it's also at a 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.360
 pin on different objects of the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.730
 daily 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 okay so the second 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.780
 characteristic it is this module 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 intelligent okay who will you 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.750
 to be able to capture the whole 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.760
 of your physical activities what do 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.310
 currently all bracelets 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.170
 connect to the market so thanks to a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.159
 accelerometer a sensor that is 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.070
 integrated in this module 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.080
 we will be able to transcribe and capture 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.080
 all the physical activities of the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.220
 everyday when I walk 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.850
 actually have calculated the number of 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.439
 not that I'm doing 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.049
 this role a little bit also two 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.070
 pedometers is also quite different 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.679
 physical activity 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.510
 ok where we come to differentiate ourselves 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.730
 with this connected object 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 it's the fact that this activity 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.500
 physical we will be able to transcribe it 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.150
 through an application will be able 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 download on his smartphone 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.600
 this dedicated application that will us 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.860
 power is ready on which one is going 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 able to make a collection of this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.530
 activity is called life log is wrong and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.390
 so this is an application that we 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.630
 allows to find all of our 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.080
 activity during the day and in the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.500
 daily 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.510
 where sony innovates okay is that at 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.920
 Beyond a physical activity we are going 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.040
 can also collect in a 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360
 logbook sort of diary 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.300
 also all of our activity 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.280
 media here we are brought daily to 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.870
 take pictures or connect to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.850
 social networks or also to 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.920
 visualize media content go 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.019
 go on youtube we view 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.340
 movies listen to music and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.049
 all of this activity 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.110
 we will also be able to see it 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.730
 appear here and nets on on 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.010
 everything that has been integrated into our 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.470
 logbook here we are going to be able 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 come here so click on his iphone and 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.549
 find here for example the fact that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.170
 I made a movie with my smartphone 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.510
 ok it's actually that's it 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.340
 reading and envied to access it and so 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.739
 very simply I will be able to come back 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.510
 so to the app agree and come 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.670
 the advantage here sought the whole of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.870
 my activity according to the months and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.359
 years so I 'll be able to come back 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.609
 three months five months later or one year 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.549
 later come back to look in a 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.840
 day is a very specific moment 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.850
 the activity that I realized with my 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.459
 smartphone okay it must be well 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.140
 differentiate a thing today we have 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.100
 a lot of connected objects that agreement 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.049
 allows us to receive 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.910
 notifications what also does the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.760
 smartphone serves that around my 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.890
 wrist if i get a sms a call or 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.569
 a facebook or twitter notification my 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.010
 bracelet will slightly vibrate and 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.950
 to actually notify me that I have received 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.239
 nathan notification that's what 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.630
 make all the bracelets connected 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.080
 today in the market 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.580
 disable we have the possibility in the 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.150
 parameters actually to be able to the 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.610
 deactivate 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.660
 we do not get bothered okay what does 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.340
 also today breweries 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.160
 connected is physical activity 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.840
 we talked about it ok and where it is 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.750
 interesting is that we will be able to 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.880
 go and look for other others 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.670
 other peculiarities so here if I 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.260
 come back and if I recover we're just going 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.060
 return 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.500
 come back here today get defined and 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.940
 here so we see here too 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 appear what's called a bookmark 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.160
 with a little heart shape it's a 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.010
 heart stroke 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.210
 so how does it work when I have 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.340
 integrated in the frozen module around the wrist 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.190
 I will be able to come here doubt the click 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.960
 okay ok and when I double 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.360
 click I will write a bookmark to my 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.950
 logbook this bookmark we are going 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.210
 able to realize this type this type 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.460
 of action when we go live a moment 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.320
 especially okay we're going a lot 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.940
 marked we will then go on this group 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.040
 mark and we'll see here for example 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.230
 I listen to a music that I liked ok 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.490
 I double click and suddenly she knows 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.980
 bookmark I can add a 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.560
 comment also sure we come by 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.650

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.820
