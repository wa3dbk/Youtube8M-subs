 then for three of the boxer race 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.629

 Mexican Federation of the American Pit Bull 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.550
 terrier an organization emerged in the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 year 2002 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.210
 It focuses on what it has to do with 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.050
 the rescue of 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.270
 the prestige of 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.430
 well of the honor of the glory of these 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.220
 american pitbull terriers maybe the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.290
 pitbull is a killer by nature is 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.270
 a loaded weapon that you never know when 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.210
 you can shoot yourself and a dog the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.500
 race that is born aggressive bad 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.110
 uncontrolled or violent that is a 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 behavior that is that I know 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.890
 generates through the environment in which 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.840
 the dog lives and especially as 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.000
 result of education 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.490
 care of discipline and time 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.940
 that the owner lavishes his 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.950
 exemplary yes of course 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.180
 look at me they ask me a lot hear this 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 he wants a pit bull that I do where 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.040
 I get where I buy it sometimes with a 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 or an overflowing passion for 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.360
 anxiety to do would be from a dog's 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.370
 these not for me the ideal is that the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.710
 people first determine if you have the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.660
 time to dedicate the dog to take 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.170
 a commitment that can be even from 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.820
 15 to 18 years where we obviously have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.870
 be prepared in terms 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.070
 economic in terms of time see what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.220
 life let's have us with a 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.350
 draft 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.180
 ten or fifteen years and necessarily 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.280
 we should be including 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.350
 our copy to our pet the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.660
 race that is the dog of the breed that is 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.370
 not only shot that there has to be 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.700
 a very important work of conscience 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.920
 to see if we are really capable and 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.900
 We can assume that commitment to 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.540
 avoid the dog then in a moment 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.250
 given a burden or resulting in 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.400
 a dog 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.740
 5 without attention without time 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.460
 dedicate and that a dog does 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.100
 so yes then 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.350
 not dangerous but not careless and with 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.760
 behaviors because of boredom or 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.760
 carelessness that can be destructive 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.700
 the problem is that the means of 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.320
 communication do nothing but show the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.930
 violence of this animal to its 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.030
 owners or other people but they do not usually 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.130
 deal with the real causes that lead 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.710
 to a pit bull or other breeds 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.330
 to show signs of aggression the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.430
 people fear violent dogs and 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.770
 quarrelsome and stay away from 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 they but do not relate the behavior of 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.700
 the animals with their owners with the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 lack of education in those who should 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.340
 educate them in whom they should 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.680
 know how to handle them they do it to defend 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.810
 to your master if you do not see yourself as 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.340
 this dog bites the thief who aims 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.290
 with a gun the owner of this 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.960
 hardware to achieve I throw it the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.060
 place 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.490
 the pit bull is a dog like so many others 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.800
 who need love and 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.740
 his family's attention the pit bulls are 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.900
 Adorable animals are faithful attentive 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.970
 obedient and of good character that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.480
 they will quickly become a member 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.480
 more of the family 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.980
 my advice to those who 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.959
 interesting to have a pit bull is to approach 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.340
 the professional people to the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.290
 people that we really know and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.960
 we know about the race 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.150
 remember the picture is not a dog 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.020
 aggressive is not a bad dog a dog 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.020
 poorly understood 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.840
 the disciplines for competitions in the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 american pitbull we found a 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.150
 as you say you bloopers not
