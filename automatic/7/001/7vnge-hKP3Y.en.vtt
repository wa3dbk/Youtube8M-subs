00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
touching this you can see bubbling and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.550 
touching this you can see bubbling and
chemicals<00:02:16.120> activating<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.200> water<00:02:17.410> is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
chemicals activating the water is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.870 
chemicals activating the water is
interacting<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> oxygen<00:02:18.580> bleach

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
interacting with the oxygen bleach

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.979 
interacting with the oxygen bleach
releasing<00:02:19.870> oxygen<00:02:21.209> causing<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.390> foaming

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
releasing oxygen causing this foaming

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.440 
releasing oxygen causing this foaming
bubbling<00:02:23.500> activity<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.670> what<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.329> know

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
bubbling activity this is what you know

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.210 
bubbling activity this is what you know
this<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.870> kind<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.410> scrubbing<00:02:26.709> activity

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
this is it's kind of scrubbing activity

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.130 
this is it's kind of scrubbing activity
that<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.459> doing<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.540> we'll<00:02:28.690> leave<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.959> here

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that it's doing so we'll leave this here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.680 
that it's doing so we'll leave this here
for<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.530> four<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.920> six<00:02:30.130> hours<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.760> we'll

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
for like four to six hours and we'll

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.460 
for like four to six hours and we'll
come<00:02:31.720> back<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.670> look<00:02:33.670> at<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.849> results

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.830 

five<00:02:41.470> hours<00:02:41.770> later<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.120> mostly<00:02:46.510> stopped

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
five hours later and it's mostly stopped

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.550 
five hours later and it's mostly stopped
foaming<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:48.130> was<00:02:48.340> very<00:02:48.580> brown<00:02:49.319> this<00:02:50.319> one

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
foaming this was very brown this one

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
foaming this was very brown this one
which<00:02:50.860> was<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.400> dirty<00:02:51.720> does<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.930> look<00:02:53.140> as

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
which was not as dirty does not look as

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.420 
which was not as dirty does not look as
brown<00:02:54.720> let's<00:02:55.720> start<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.020> this<00:02:56.110> one<00:02:56.350> stump<00:02:57.280> up

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
brown let's start with this one stump up

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.170 
brown let's start with this one stump up
some<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.760> water<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.300> what<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.540> got

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
some of this water see what we got

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:28.229 
some of this water see what we got
that's<00:03:01.180> actually<00:03:21.570> step<00:03:22.570> out<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> wrists<00:03:27.239> take

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
that's actually step out the wrists take

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.310 
that's actually step out the wrists take
a<00:03:28.269> look<00:03:28.510> inside<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:31.390> hard<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.720> see<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.260> that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
a look inside it's hard to see but that

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.050 
a look inside it's hard to see but that
is<00:03:34.380> crystal<00:03:35.380> clear<00:03:35.680> let's<00:03:36.400> make<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.700> new

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
is crystal clear let's make a new

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.460 
is crystal clear let's make a new
stainless<00:03:37.750> steel<00:03:38.250> there's<00:03:39.250> all<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.470> black

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
stainless steel there's all the black

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.770 
stainless steel there's all the black
that<00:03:41.769> was<00:03:41.860> off<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.190> size<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.850> remember<00:03:43.720> I

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
that was off the size I remember I

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.890 
that was off the size I remember I
scrubbed<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.440> before<00:03:45.360> no<00:03:46.360> scrubbing<00:03:46.690> with

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
scrubbed that before no scrubbing with

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.020 
scrubbed that before no scrubbing with
this<00:03:47.079> though<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.739> just<00:03:47.769> was<00:03:48.340> totally<00:03:48.610> cleared

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
this though it just was totally cleared
