 By writing it thinks that there is a park It is erotic p or something like that 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:47.200
 Thing is I think I also much in words but 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.720
 I think that I want to show in the results as a player as a central flight geek a second 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:58.020
 jwp players often well lately avert belts and bells 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.590
 That 's why I have a feeling 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 I wonder if I think about what it means to take a belt 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.400
 Where 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.610

 One half is not a bother to have a belt of tank 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.409
