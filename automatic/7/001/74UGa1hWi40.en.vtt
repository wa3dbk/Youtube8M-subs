00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.830
 My name is Vladislav 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 I am glad to welcome you to mod reviews 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.960
 for the game spintires 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.449
 Today I have a pastran monster on my review 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.839
 truck but the name here as you can see 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:42.269
 speaks for itself let's see 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:44.519
 add-ons as you see they are not here but 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:50.250
 chip this mod is not at all addons 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:52.019
 let's start the engine and immediately 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.699
 the beginning of the review will go on the way 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:00.449
 tests as you can see turning 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 we are all four wheels here and at all 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.589
 mods see this in the description of this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.330
 fashion was also written that he 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.049
 moves off with increased let's it 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.509
 check so everything is fine air form you 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 in a few seconds they did it 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.450
 check the suspension so we have suspension 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 works fine I want to also say that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 I updated my map a little bit 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.499
 new road from last but for now 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 objects than I will write in more detail all 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:40.020
 from where objects were taken here somewhere in the corner 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.420
 above all you can read everything 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.630
 find it on the internet and also post it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.929
 on your card and we are here in the meantime 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.369
 mud got out as we see on the wheels 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.369
 enough dirt stuck 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.990
 so after all on the elevated we can 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.560
 stall so i trust 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.560
 automatic box 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.960
 film of bone times without differential 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.960
 rode so go to the water procedures 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.200
 so well here in principle for this car 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.410
 no difficulty 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.170
 so we have evening, I wasted 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.390
 back time that's better 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.160
 so the sounds we have here from the standard 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.840
 kamaz but basically they go this 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.060
 car so here we are approaching 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.110
 felling for today we go there 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.280
 no need to go here here us 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.830
 the village and here another water 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 an obstacle waiting for us which is this 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.280
 monster truck easily passes 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.299
 I want to say fuel consumption is not much 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.019
 big as for such a machine in principle 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.019
 normal 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.800
 so another mud obstacle 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.810
 so we will not go there as there 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.310
 closed garage will be waiting for us so we 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.850
 let's roll here 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.650
 let's go along the railway and we will 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.650
 pick up a driver 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:50.020
 wow 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:54.040
 so the speed let us down a little 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.670
 lost control a little but 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:06.380
 here we can look at the damage 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:08.990
 lesbians applied and it is good inside 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.300
 this monster truck want to say everything 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.450
 very well done 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.540
 look at everything on the engine 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.540
 driver's seat on organs 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.180
 controls that is all very cool 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.410
 done so now in general now 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.640
 will be dispersed on here that's 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.640
 tramplinchik jumped on a piece of iron 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.520
 Yes, a little bit we did not fly but like this 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.730
 Here is such a spectacular trick 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.730
 turned out 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.800
 so we all already puff labels understand 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.800
 full 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.770
 so let's stop somewhere before 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:10.770
 machine smokes principle nehilo so wanted 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:15.060
 still say so basically on the edge of the map 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.180
 let's stop our car and in 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.190
 principle you can sum up i'm 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.300
 I love the principle of such a monster 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.910
 trucks I remember once played a long time ago 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.960
 monster jam big race basically 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.360
 probably this car is taken from there 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.200
 but I will be glad if some more monster 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.380
 tracks envelope in spintires principle 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.900
 it will be nice well what can I say 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.080
 on this car car what is 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.320
 vigorous frisky that is, I have focused here 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.820
 so understand the ride quality in 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.210
 principle cars 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.060
 I understand it was made for fan and in 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.410
 principle with this task machine 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.280
 copes that is fun on it 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.980
 ride 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.770
 swoop overcome all sorts 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.770
 obstacles than a very cool car 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.790
 pallet and of course it would be nice if their 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.060
 added but in principle without them this 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.620
 car good external plan here in 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.720
 principle, too, everything is done very 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:24.060
 high quality machine detail is very 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.400
 good animation in principle too 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.740
 pleased animation suspension animation 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.080
 body that's all I wanted 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.750
 say on this fashion link to it 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.860
