00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
that's just a wind or a bit of liquid

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.520 
that's just a wind or a bit of liquid
liner<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.209> know<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> fact<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.230> didn't

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
liner I know for a fact that they didn't

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.230 
liner I know for a fact that they didn't
use<00:00:16.800> any<00:00:16.830> eyeshadow<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:17.940> say<00:00:18.120> they

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
use any eyeshadow will they say they

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
use any eyeshadow will they say they
didn't<00:00:18.860> but<00:00:19.860> I<00:00:20.539> decided<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.840> add<00:00:22.019> it<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
didn't but I decided to add it and I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.529 
didn't but I decided to add it and I
think<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.279> gives<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> bit<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> dimension<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
think it gives it a bit of dimension and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
think it gives it a bit of dimension and
sort<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.039> real<00:00:26.250> Greek<00:00:26.820> goddess<00:00:27.480> kind<00:00:27.960> of

sort of as a real Greek goddess kind of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.089 
sort of as a real Greek goddess kind of
style<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.039> paired<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.970> curled

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
style and I paired it with this curled

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
style and I paired it with this curled
bouffant<00:00:32.099> hair<00:00:32.400> so<00:00:33.180> keep<00:00:33.750> watching<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.110> you

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
this one this is a sigma blending brush

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.390 
this one this is a sigma blending brush
this<00:01:18.300> small<00:01:18.630> tapered<00:01:19.230> blending<00:01:19.620> brush<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
now I'm going to run this through my

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.390 
now I'm going to run this through my
crease<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:24.110> blending<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.260> up<00:01:25.410> slightly<00:01:26.480> and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
crease and blending it up slightly and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.560 
crease and blending it up slightly and
to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.030> using<00:01:30.210> circular

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to do that I'm just using circular

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.660 
to do that I'm just using circular
motions

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.910 

next<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:38.600> taking<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.350> color<00:01:39.650> called

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
next I'm taking this color called

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.800 
next I'm taking this color called
chocolate<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.760> it's<00:01:41.000> by<00:01:41.180> micro<00:01:41.720> shadow<00:01:42.340> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
chocolate and it's by micro shadow and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.550 
chocolate and it's by micro shadow and
it's<00:01:44.810> pretty<00:01:45.080> much<00:01:45.170> very<00:01:46.130> similar<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:47.560> sidecar

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's pretty much very similar to sidecar

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620 
it's pretty much very similar to sidecar
I<00:01:48.890> think<00:01:49.430> but<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:49.729> without<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.240> glitter

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
I think but just without the glitter

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.830 
I think but just without the glitter
it's<00:01:50.810> sort<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.170> similar<00:01:51.380> shade<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.840> not

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's sort of a similar shade and not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840 
it's sort of a similar shade and not
that<00:01:53.990> brush<00:01:54.170> I'm<00:01:54.350> using<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.070> from<00:01:55.369> Sigma

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
that brush I'm using this one from Sigma

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.910 
that brush I'm using this one from Sigma
as<00:01:55.970> well<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.509> pencil<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.259> 30<00:01:57.590> brush

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
as well this is the pencil a 30 brush

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.180 
as well this is the pencil a 30 brush
and<00:01:58.250> I'm<00:01:58.940> putting<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.509> in<00:01:59.720> there<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.619> then

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I'm putting that in there and then

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.520 
and I'm putting that in there and then
I'm<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.759> draw<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.390> into<00:02:02.810> my<00:02:03.229> crease

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
I'm going to draw this into my crease

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.430 
I'm going to draw this into my crease
and<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:04.070> going<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.490> layer<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.940> up<00:02:05.180> until<00:02:05.800> it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and I'm going to layer this up until it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.840 
and I'm going to layer this up until it
until<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.530> defines<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.100> crease<00:02:10.369> really<00:02:10.700> well

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
until it defines the crease really well

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:21.190 
until it defines the crease really well
so<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.500> use<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> fair<00:02:13.040> bit

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200

Hypnose<00:04:04.670> drama<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:08.890> believe<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.310> show

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
Hypnose drama I believe that in the show

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.220 
Hypnose drama I believe that in the show
the<00:04:10.670> girls<00:04:10.910> didn't<00:04:11.210> wear<00:04:11.360> false<00:04:11.630> eyelashes

the girls didn't wear false eyelashes

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.760 
the girls didn't wear false eyelashes
but<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:13.150> think<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.270> our<00:04:14.420> mere<00:04:14.960> mortals

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
but I think that our mere mortals

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.600 
but I think that our mere mortals
we<00:04:15.920> need<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:17.030> boost<00:04:17.709> we<00:04:18.709> need<00:04:18.860> that<00:04:19.070> boost<00:04:19.250> so

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
we need to boost we need that boost so

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.540 
we need to boost we need that boost so

Mac it's called Spring Sheen I'm using a

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.560 
Mac it's called Spring Sheen I'm using a
blush<00:05:29.690> brush<00:05:30.640> just<00:05:31.640> not<00:05:31.880> too<00:05:32.060> much<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.450> this

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
blush brush just not too much of this

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.260 
blush brush just not too much of this
because<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.230> little<00:05:33.350> bit<00:05:33.500> shimmery<00:05:33.920> and

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270
