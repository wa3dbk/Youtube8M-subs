00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.189
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.820
 Today's makeup is inspired by the ra 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.310
 l 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
 haha complete a year of glory could not 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.640
 stop coming here to pay tribute 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.029
 for her not the simple homage I 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.619
 I really like her and she still has a lot of strength. 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.750
 when I saw youtube on other outside 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.670
 things in life she is very dear to 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.160
 me when I think of her the image of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.980
 make-up so neutral mood with emotion 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.329
 very chic in a mouth for that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.050
 I made a menu inspired by it. 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.450
 little way 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.370
 come to start picking up a base 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.179
 since and I will apply across the eyelid 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.339
 mobile 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.410
 I applied against you when you said no 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.410
 needs freshness, we can stay 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.480
 fear that denies it works beneath the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.309
 eyebrow I passed beige pencil - ea 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.199
 played this many times, huh? 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.170
 hence it was forbidden to record a theater 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.340
 the world already knows, do not make a pencil 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.950
 now spread it with a ribbon he golf 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.550
 eye with hair chop start 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.890
 so know now I'll take a beige shadow 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.390
 and plate I will apply across the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.390
 movable eyelid with light beats 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.100
 celebrates tapas because only the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.720
 product is very intense, I applied 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.400
 more than one layer this is a trick that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.230
 it's a meter trick I always say 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.590
 for makeup to last long and stay 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:39.530
 with a very lively tone it works now takes 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.260
 a brown shadow and the cuddly brush and I 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.170
 I'm going to do it, but it's all with the car. 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.030
 so it added in a smooth and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.030
 then I come with an expression like that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.370
 with more force on top of the sky mall 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.370
 sinks to get the darkest good 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 circular movements and will see 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.220
 touching brown to the tape also of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.050
 can pull and get a beautiful effect now 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.209
 Take an opaque black shadow and I 'll 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.830
 choose your outer tank I 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.660
 choose diagonally by doing 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 fast movements 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.050
 of ball 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.569
 this movement ensures that the mec has already done 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.870
 formed in which the black mixi with a beige 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:28.239
 and max as brown understood forming a 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.239
 greyish gray that derives from black 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.500
 will have in the black shadow a double 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.349
 until it's the color you want 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.220
 Okay, I'm going back to the brown shadow now. 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.830
 provincial cousin and I go and Somali 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.680
 between black beige and black and the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.130
 sea will make transition more beautiful 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.599
 is now well with eyeliner and I'm going 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.920
 make a basic pull 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.920
 the tape helps a lot, huh? 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.920
 carefully and took the tape and I'll get a 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.110
 black pencil 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.850
 I fill the entire water line and also the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.300
 blurring the region net to lashes 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:36.430
 less easy though no director 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.990
 It has to thicken a lot, it's not okay. 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.990
 more soft little grow 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.960
 now there is an opaque dark brown shadow 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.520
 in makeup practically practically 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.260
 nothing is totally opaque 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.060
 do you like the uefs that would block 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.400
 totally the pact I know 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.500
 I'm going to smoke there and dark opaque chimarrÃ£o 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.150
 to the lower lashes until I spoke 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.150
 that I want I'll apply a two 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.920
 layers should receive but so may 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.450
 stay as dark as you want it's okay 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.820
 I like it very dark because it is not 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.560
 small and increases but if you prefer 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.830
 here's the softest thing you can do here 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.150
 great now take a beige shadow and I'll 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.769
 apply an internal campaign the same 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.760
 beige shade to idc in eyelash line 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.480
 underwear makeup is ready to say 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.730
 that the lip inserts I used a 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.010
 lipstick is a release of the collection pause 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.660
 for feminices evans I think this 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.550
 week or the next 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.310
 It's a wine that I thought of as a 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.480
 dry blood bond knows the petal of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.410
 dry rose 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.860
 it has a more marching texture more 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.930
 underneath all and a wonderful bone there 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.540
 when she went to buy you but she 's 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.490
 reaching the skin and used for tanning 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.250
 domineering and that's it 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.070
