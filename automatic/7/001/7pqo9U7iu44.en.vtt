how to draw an apple so first we're
going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> start<00:00:08.400> out<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.590> circle<00:00:10.590> you

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
going to start out with a circle you

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.560 
going to start out with a circle you
could<00:00:10.830> either<00:00:10.950> trace<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:11.880> something

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
could either trace it from something

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
could either trace it from something
round<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.500> draw<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> final

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
round or draw it this this is the final

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870 
round or draw it this this is the final
size<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.449> our<00:00:18.630> Apple<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> use

this sharpie fine point pen black marker
okay<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.750> I'll<00:00:28.080> start<00:00:28.349> from<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> top<00:00:31.759> go

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
okay so I'll start from the top go

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.470 
okay so I'll start from the top go
around<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.850> top<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.559> circle<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.480> as

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
around this the top of the circle now as

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
around this the top of the circle now as
I<00:00:39.600> come<00:00:39.960> lower<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:47.059> like
