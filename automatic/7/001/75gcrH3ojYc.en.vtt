place at times and horrible to say but

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
place at times and horrible to say but
because<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.849> sort<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.180> Disney<00:03:00.420> style

because it is sort of a Disney style
maybe<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.680> could<00:03:01.829> have<00:03:01.890> benefited<00:03:02.459> more<00:03:02.640> from

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
maybe it could have benefited more from

maybe it could have benefited more from
a<00:03:02.940> little<00:03:03.150> bit<00:03:03.239> more<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.540> Disney<00:03:03.959> design<00:03:04.409> I

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
a little bit more the Disney design I

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.410 
a little bit more the Disney design I
mean<00:03:05.069> some<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.489> look<00:03:05.730> good<00:03:05.909> that<00:03:06.120> others

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
mean some of them look good that others

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.050 
mean some of them look good that others
do<00:03:06.870> look<00:03:07.200> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.560> odd<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.760> said

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
do look kind of odd but with that said

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.940 
do look kind of odd but with that said
the<00:03:09.209> distracting<00:03:09.780> moments<00:03:10.139> are<00:03:10.260> never<00:03:10.500> too

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
the distracting moments are never too

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.220 
the distracting moments are never too
distracting<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.239> what<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:13.019> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
distracting and you know what I like the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.259 
distracting and you know what I like the
songs<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.829> think<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.370> help<00:03:14.609> move<00:03:14.760> along<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
songs I think they help move along the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.000 
songs I think they help move along the
story<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> they<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.139> very<00:03:16.409> visually<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
story and they do in a very visually a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.069 
story and they do in a very visually a
Musical<00:03:17.579> II<00:03:17.609> interesting<00:03:18.269> way<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.930> don't

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
Musical II interesting way so I don't

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.140 
Musical II interesting way so I don't
mind<00:03:19.440> them<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.769> think<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:20.099> really<00:03:20.370> work<00:03:20.579> but

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
mind them I think they really work but

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.789 
mind them I think they really work but
many<00:03:21.420> would<00:03:21.690> argue<00:03:21.720> if<00:03:22.200> you're<00:03:22.349> really<00:03:22.560> gonna

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
true especially with something as heavy

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.229 
true especially with something as heavy
as<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.709> story<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.099> Moses<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> also

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
as the story of Moses but I also

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.970 
as the story of Moses but I also
understand<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.019> need<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.470> appeal<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.829> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
understand the need to appeal to a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.280 
understand the need to appeal to a
general<00:03:38.400> public<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.690> said<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.109> think

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
general public and like I said I think

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.650 
general public and like I said I think
they<00:03:40.680> work<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.190> pretty<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.269> stand

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
they work it in pretty well so I stand

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.009 
they work it in pretty well so I stand
by<00:03:42.810> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
by it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.500 
by it
at<00:03:43.379> least<00:03:43.650> by<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.859> songs<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.819> feel<00:03:45.120> bad<00:03:45.299> this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
at least by the songs I do feel bad this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.960 
at least by the songs I do feel bad this
movie<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:45.959> more<00:03:46.489> appreciated<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.639> maybe

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
movie is not more appreciated and maybe

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.970 
movie is not more appreciated and maybe
it<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.359> because<00:03:48.569> Ten<00:03:49.049> Commandments<00:03:49.590> was<00:03:49.739> just

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
it is because Ten Commandments was just

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.129 
it is because Ten Commandments was just
such<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.430> landmark<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.540> even<00:03:51.750> though<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.989> is

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
such a landmark and even though this is

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.900 
such a landmark and even though this is
a<00:03:52.169> good<00:03:52.410> film<00:03:52.709> yeah<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.430> probably<00:03:53.669> not

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
a good film yeah it's probably not

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.720 
a good film yeah it's probably not
really<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.359> landmark<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.530> any<00:03:55.680> way<00:03:55.919> at<00:03:56.459> least

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
really a landmark in any way at least

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.189 
really a landmark in any way at least
not<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.269> way<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.599> most<00:03:57.780> people<00:03:57.930> view

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
not the way that most people view

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.800 
not the way that most people view
cinematic<00:03:58.889> landmarks<00:03:59.519> but<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.239> still<00:04:00.540> think

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
cinematic landmarks but I still think

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.900 
cinematic landmarks but I still think
it's<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.049> good<00:04:01.290> strong<00:04:01.650> film<00:04:02.069> better<00:04:02.489> than<00:04:02.730> Ten

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
it's a good strong film better than Ten

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.819 
it's a good strong film better than Ten
Commandments<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.510> fact<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.319> has<00:04:04.530> great

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829

even if you're one of those people that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.839 
even if you're one of those people that
can't<00:04:12.959> fully<00:04:13.319> get<00:04:13.620> into<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.159> still<00:04:14.609> say

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.719 
really great stuff in it and I think the
story<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.260> Moses<00:04:19.650> deserves<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.159> be<00:04:20.280> told<00:04:20.459> from

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
story of Moses deserves to be told from

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.399 
story of Moses deserves to be told from
a<00:04:20.789> different<00:04:21.000> point<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.419> view<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.199> a

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
a different point of view and this is a

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.070 
a different point of view and this is a
very<00:04:22.710> smart<00:04:23.280> point<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:23.909> view<00:04:24.090> what<00:04:24.690> else<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:24.990> I
