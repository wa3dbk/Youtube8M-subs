00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.410
 Hello, how about here? 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.980
 we are testing the battlefield beta 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 4 so is the open beta just out 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 so you do not count hours 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 is an open is an open beta the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.760
 public 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.300
 so you can not load through 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300
 origin 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.320
 I think it weighs around 5 gigas 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.140
 approximately 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.740
 before existence and the requirements of 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 system and especially operating system 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.160
 are asking for an operating system of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.579
 64 bits so those that have 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 32 bit windows unfortunately not 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.540
 they will be able to run this beta so now 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.540
 I'm telling you 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.800
 at the coastal level of the shell of 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.629
 your mother understand 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.329
 and that contrast when with the details 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.630
 to the maximum because the pc that I have does not 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.730
 It allows 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.340
 it's time to change the pieces things to 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.140
 my pc so I can run the games 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.380
 that come but in forward but good 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.909
 beyond that the game itself is very 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
 fun I had a lot of fun in this 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.360
 domination game mode 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.950
 Not enough action, enough movement 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.650
 and he's also trying on the other 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.750
 game mode of conquest on this map 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 but you can not record the game 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 because it was too long 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.480
 so 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.790
 but I preferred to record this 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.440
 understanding is useful not be giving 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.740
 turns on the map because I'm a little 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.299
 lost on the sidewalk I'm playing 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.710
 I think I have to be taking a 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.710
 moment because I do not know what's wrong with me 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.299
 I do not know I think I'm a bit tough if he 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 because time I do not have a stain 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.960
 any water 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.100
 to see what we have here we have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 rocket launcher that doctor knife 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.090
 machine gun shit so much that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 he carries a heart backpack a little 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.100
 rare egg 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.600
 I'm running like a duck 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.600
 we are going to defend the homeland 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.550
 I do not know what notes great notes 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 I have lost help you tell me what I do 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.620
 kill him 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.140
 now I'm going to put here in this house 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.790
 because I do not know I feel very insecure turn 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.129
 I want to stay the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.129
 the heels 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 let's defend our practice 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.160
 and closing 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.160
 now let's use my super spear 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.890
 bombs 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.540
 and we are going to send a Chinese man to hell 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.620
 kill bombs 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 Hahaha 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.900

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.190
 appeared out of nowhere he said putter 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.610
 but you do not have to see it 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.000
 I have a bullet lodged in the buttock 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.000
 left minute 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.970
 now it must be wrong 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.970

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.190

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.190
 besides the window 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:55.430
 normal fucking through the game 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.430

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.120

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.460

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.940
 what happens to me 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.190
 I think the piece is already there 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.190
 seeing that he changes the pieces a little 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.690
 Hahaha 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.040
 I do not show you anymore you need 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.050
 when they killed 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.050
 of the dead 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.310
 As intimacies, I feel like 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.440
 a little self-conscious makes home 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.780

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.950
