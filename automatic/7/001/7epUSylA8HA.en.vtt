00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
mercure with another lego creation so it

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.040 
mercure with another lego creation so it
is<00:00:04.290> basically<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.980> giant<00:00:05.400> wall<00:00:06.440> and<00:00:07.970> I<00:00:09.050> don't

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is basically a giant wall and I don't

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.110 
is basically a giant wall and I don't
really<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.559> many<00:00:10.980> great<00:00:11.460> pieces<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
really have that many great pieces I

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.539 
really have that many great pieces I
can't<00:00:12.540> make<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> rest<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.830> supposed<00:00:14.429> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
can't make the rest of what supposed to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.340 
can't make the rest of what supposed to
be<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> giant<00:00:15.150> castle<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:17.779> my<00:00:18.779> original<00:00:19.140> plan

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
be a giant castle but my original plan

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620 
be a giant castle but my original plan
was<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.220> buy<00:00:20.369> tons<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> tons<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.449> grey

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
was to be just buy tons and tons of grey

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.160 
was to be just buy tons and tons of grey
bricks<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.160> make<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> colossal<00:00:24.060> castle<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
bricks and make a colossal castle then I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.730 
bricks and make a colossal castle then I
realized<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.769> no<00:00:26.010> space<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:28.080> support<00:00:28.529> such

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
realized I have no space to support such

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.780 
realized I have no space to support such
a<00:00:28.769> structure<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.529> I'm<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.980> creative<00:00:32.309> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a structure and I'm not that creative so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.110 
a structure and I'm not that creative so
there<00:00:33.630> would<00:00:33.809> kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> time<00:00:34.880> brick<00:00:35.880> wall

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
there would kind of be a time brick wall

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.280 
there would kind of be a time brick wall
but<00:00:39.120> actually<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> try<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
but actually for this one I try to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.160 
but actually for this one I try to
change<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.390> as<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.930> there

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
change it up a bit as you can see there

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.910 
change it up a bit as you can see there
is<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:44.570> various<00:00:46.010> different<00:00:47.010> colors<00:00:48.559> there<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
is a various different colors there is a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.479 
is a various different colors there is a
few<00:00:50.190> tan<00:00:50.430> breaks<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> some<00:00:51.149> dark<00:00:51.480> grey<00:00:51.719> bricks

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
few tan breaks and some dark grey bricks

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
few tan breaks and some dark grey bricks
there<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.789> briefly<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:55.010> that's<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.219> i

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
there so briefly this that's right i

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.529 
there so briefly this that's right i
described<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.160> though<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.149> windows

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
described and though there's two windows

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.399 
described and though there's two windows
they're<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> same<00:01:01.770> location<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:03.409> meant

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
they're not in the same location I meant

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
they're not in the same location I meant
to<00:01:04.530> fix<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> never<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.270> around<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> do

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to fix that but I never got around to do

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.109 
to fix that but I never got around to do
and<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.130> supposed<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.010 

half-timbered<00:01:13.880> structure<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.570> part<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
half-timbered structure as part of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.520 
half-timbered structure as part of the
wall<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.520> any<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.439> don't<00:01:19.439> have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
technique from well pretty much just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.749

cool the lego castle when you see if

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.109 
cool the lego castle when you see if
whole<00:01:42.150> bunch<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> similar

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
whole bunch of them with a similar

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
whole bunch of them with a similar
column<00:01:45.119> 6<00:01:45.540> sticking<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.780> over<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
column 6 sticking out and over here the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.510 
column 6 sticking out and over here the
inside<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.220> pretty<00:01:50.939> much<00:01:51.119> nothing<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
inside is pretty much nothing and you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.310 
inside is pretty much nothing and you
can<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.390> house<00:01:55.200> structure<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.880> very

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
can see that the house structure is very

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
can see that the house structure is very
very<00:01:58.320> tight<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.979> never<00:01:59.820> built<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> other<00:02:00.360> side

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
very tight I never built the other side

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.100 
very tight I never built the other side
to<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:02.369> any<00:02:02.579> platform<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.509> wall<00:02:03.689> for

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to it or any platform for the wall for

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.910 
to it or any platform for the wall for
people<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> walk<00:02:04.740> in

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.790 

maybe<00:02:12.920> someday<00:02:13.280> I'll<00:02:13.580> try<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.570> make<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.870> into

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
maybe someday I'll try to make this into

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.230 
maybe someday I'll try to make this into
something<00:02:15.830> better<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.640> break<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.150> apart

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
something better or just break it apart

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.710 
something better or just break it apart
to<00:02:17.720> make<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> city<00:02:19.790> buildings<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.540> my

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
to make like a city buildings for my

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.010 
to make like a city buildings for my
condom<00:02:21.170> stop<00:02:21.920> motion<00:02:22.100> videos<00:02:22.580> or<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.840> making

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
condom stop motion videos or just making

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.440 
condom stop motion videos or just making
like<00:02:24.680> sort<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.130> cliffs<00:02:25.490> or<00:02:25.730> mounting<00:02:26.240> niche

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
like sort of cliffs or mounting niche

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.220 
like sort of cliffs or mounting niche
stuff<00:02:27.970> also<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> condoms<00:02:29.720> download<00:02:30.080> your

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
stuff also for the condoms download your

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.060 
stuff also for the condoms download your
video<00:02:31.960> so<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:32.990> guess<00:02:33.290> that's<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:33.770> this

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
video so I guess that's it for this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.340 
video so I guess that's it for this
video
