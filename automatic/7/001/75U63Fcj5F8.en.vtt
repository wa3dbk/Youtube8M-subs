00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.330 

so<00:00:05.870> now<00:00:05.990> we're<00:00:06.170> going<00:00:06.259> to<00:00:06.319> even<00:00:06.560> expand<00:00:07.130> on

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
so now we're going to even expand on

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.879 
so now we're going to even expand on
this<00:00:07.660> moving<00:00:08.660> baseline<00:00:09.110> concept<00:00:09.680> we're<00:00:09.770> going

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
this moving baseline concept we're going

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.770 
this moving baseline concept we're going
to<00:00:09.950> we're<00:00:10.520> going<00:00:10.610> to<00:00:10.670> extend<00:00:11.090> it<00:00:11.209> even<00:00:11.510> further

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
to we're going to extend it even further

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.720 
to we're going to extend it even further
and<00:00:12.080> that<00:00:12.139> that<00:00:12.650> gets<00:00:12.799> into<00:00:13.039> a<00:00:13.070> tricky<00:00:13.490> chord

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
and that that gets into a tricky chord

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.770 
and that that gets into a tricky chord
progression<00:00:14.210> where<00:00:14.299> we're<00:00:14.450> going<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.630> deal

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
progression where we're going to deal

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.499 
progression where we're going to deal
with<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:14.929> 15<00:00:15.589> and<00:00:15.920> then<00:00:15.980> another<00:00:16.250> 15<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.450> then

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
with a 15 and then another 15 and then

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.659 
with a 15 and then another 15 and then
we're<00:00:17.990> going<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.140> go<00:00:18.200> to<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.439> four<00:00:18.680> chord<00:00:19.040> back

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:19.669 
we're going to go to the four chord back

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.060 
we're going to go to the four chord back
to<00:00:19.849> the<00:00:19.910> 1<00:00:19.939> chord<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.599> the<00:00:20.689> 5<00:00:20.900> chord<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:21.590> that's

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
to the 1 chord and the 5 chord so that's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.159 
to the 1 chord and the 5 chord so that's
all<00:00:22.250> kind<00:00:22.489> of<00:00:22.579> confusing<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.149> remember<00:00:23.599> but

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
all kind of confusing to remember but

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.929 
all kind of confusing to remember but
when<00:00:24.349> you<00:00:24.500> see<00:00:24.770> how<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.040> chord<00:00:25.460> progression

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
when you see how the chord progression

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.030 
when you see how the chord progression
comes<00:00:25.970> together<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.140> moving<00:00:27.439> baseline

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
comes together in the moving baseline

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.589 
comes together in the moving baseline
which<00:00:28.309> is<00:00:28.460> just<00:00:28.669> an<00:00:28.790> extension<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.300> what<00:00:29.360> we

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
which is just an extension of what we

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.990 
which is just an extension of what we
just<00:00:29.630> did<00:00:30.020> in<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.380> previous<00:00:30.710> chapter<00:00:31.000> you'll

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
just did in the previous chapter you'll

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.240 
just did in the previous chapter you'll
see<00:00:32.390> that<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.260> actually<00:00:33.320> makes<00:00:33.950> a<00:00:34.100> lot<00:00:34.130> of

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
see that it actually makes a lot of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.569 
see that it actually makes a lot of
sense<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.059> our<00:00:35.329> one<00:00:35.840> chord<00:00:36.399> I'm<00:00:37.399> going<00:00:37.519> to

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
sense so our one chord I'm going to

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.990 
sense so our one chord I'm going to
stick<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.940> key<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.149> C<00:00:38.239> for<00:00:39.140> now<00:00:39.789> then<00:00:40.789> we're

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
stick in the key of C for now then we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.490 
stick in the key of C for now then we're
going<00:00:41.089> to<00:00:41.149> go<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.329> our<00:00:41.390> five<00:00:41.750> chord<00:00:42.079> but<00:00:42.350> we're

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
going to go to our five chord but we're

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.829 
going to go to our five chord but we're
going<00:00:42.589> to<00:00:42.649> move<00:00:43.120> with<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.239> base<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:44.719> we're

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
going to move with the base so we're

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.560 
going to move with the base so we're
going<00:00:44.929> to<00:00:45.019> do<00:00:45.109> a<00:00:45.140> G<00:00:45.440> over<00:00:45.589> B<00:00:45.890> again<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:47.420> my

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
going to do a G over B again so my

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.770 
going to do a G over B again so my
baseline<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.019> gone<00:00:48.079> from<00:00:48.320> C<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.559> B<00:00:49.480> now<00:00:50.480> we're

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
baseline is gone from C to B now we're

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.459 
baseline is gone from C to B now we're
going<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:50.960> go<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.109> a<00:00:51.199> minor<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:54.019> actually<00:00:54.170> we're

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
going to go to a minor so actually we're

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.160 
going to go to a minor so actually we're
using<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.399> six<00:00:55.909> chord<00:00:56.390> instead<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.960> one

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
using the six chord instead of the one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.309 
using the six chord instead of the one
here<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.670> that's<00:00:58.879> going<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.120> be<00:00:59.210> our<00:00:59.390> relative

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
here so that's going to be our relative

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.729 
here so that's going to be our relative
minor<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.829> six<00:01:01.159> a<00:01:01.399> minor<00:01:01.999> in<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.210> key<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.480> C

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
minor the six a minor in the key of C

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.160 
minor the six a minor in the key of C
now<00:01:03.739> I'm<00:01:04.040> going<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.280> hint<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.850> chord<00:01:05.659> change<00:01:05.930> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
now I'm going to hint a chord change to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.320 
now I'm going to hint a chord change to
G<00:01:06.700> by<00:01:07.700> taking<00:01:08.360> my<00:01:08.479> pinky<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.610> just<00:01:10.610> playing

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
G by taking my pinky and just playing

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.570 
G by taking my pinky and just playing
the<00:01:11.420> note<00:01:11.750> G<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.320> it's<00:01:12.440> an<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.740> minor<00:01:13.040> with<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> G

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
the note G so it's an a minor with a G

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.200 
the note G so it's an a minor with a G
in<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.730> base

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.580 

similar<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.360> playing<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.900> sea<00:01:18.110> with<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.320> G<00:01:18.500> in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
similar to playing a sea with the G in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.350 
similar to playing a sea with the G in
the<00:01:18.620> base<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.310> we're<00:01:19.460> playing<00:01:19.700> an<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:20.030> minor

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
the base but we're playing an a minor

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.930 
the base but we're playing an a minor
with<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.230> G<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.680> base<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.610> I'm<00:01:22.760> going<00:01:22.910> to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
with a G in the base then I'm going to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.540 
with a G in the base then I'm going to
go<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.150> F

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.360 

then<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.690> see<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> i'm

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
then I'm going to go to see but i'm

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.150 
then I'm going to go to see but i'm
going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.550> play<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.240> base<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.690> then<00:01:34.160> for

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
going to play in the base and then for

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.400 
going to play in the base and then for
the<00:01:35.250> turn<00:01:35.430> around<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:36.180> i'll<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.510> 2d<00:01:36.870> and<00:01:37.200> then

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
the turn around here i'll go 2d and then

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.190 
the turn around here i'll go 2d and then
2g<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.520> may<00:01:38.700> change<00:01:39.030> depending<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
2g and that may change depending on the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
2g and that may change depending on the
songs<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> turnarounds<00:01:41.220> may<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.400> different

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
songs the turnarounds may be different

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
songs the turnarounds may be different
but<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> important<00:01:42.420> thing<00:01:42.480> here<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.870> my<00:01:43.530> one

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
but the important thing here is my one

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.610 
but the important thing here is my one
chord

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
chord

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.910

see my five chord but with the be in the
base<00:01:49.070> G<00:01:49.460> would<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.670> be<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.000> base<00:01:50.710> my<00:01:51.710> minor

that<00:03:19.330> share<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.080> idea<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:21.070> can<00:03:21.190> do<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.370> a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
that share this idea we can do it in a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.630 
that share this idea we can do it in a
different<00:03:21.549> key

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
different key

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.700 
different key
in<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.330> case<00:03:24.540> our<00:03:24.780> one<00:03:24.960> chord<00:03:25.140> would<00:03:25.319> be<00:03:25.440> D

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
in which case our one chord would be D

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.400 
in which case our one chord would be D
then<00:03:26.190> when<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.550> our<00:03:26.670> 5a<00:03:27.360> we're<00:03:28.230> going<00:03:28.319> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
then when we go to our 5a we're going to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.350 
then when we go to our 5a we're going to
throw<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.650> C<00:03:29.130> sharp<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.240> have

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
throw that C sharp in there so we have

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.470 
throw that C sharp in there so we have
that<00:03:30.510> movement<00:03:31.080> from<00:03:31.200> D<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> C<00:03:31.920> sharp<00:03:32.480> I'm

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
that movement from D to C sharp I'm

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.520 
that movement from D to C sharp I'm
going<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.810> go<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> be<00:03:34.350> minor

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.559 

then<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.190> got<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.430> get<00:03:38.580> an<00:03:38.700> A<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.209> base<00:03:39.390> to

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
then I got to get an A in the base to

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.420 
then I got to get an A in the base to
keep<00:03:39.720> my<00:03:39.900> movement<00:03:40.380> going<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.890> I'm<00:03:41.250> just

chord<00:05:27.110> progression<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.680> song<00:05:28.000> starting

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
chord progression of the song starting

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.300 
chord progression of the song starting
with<00:05:29.090> my<00:05:29.210> C<00:05:29.449> major<00:05:29.690> chord<00:05:29.900> kind<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.949> ending<00:05:31.190> on

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
with my C major chord kind of ending on

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.820 
with my C major chord kind of ending on
my<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> minor<00:05:31.909> there<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.440> then<00:05:33.440> with<00:05:33.680> my

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
my a minor there and then with my

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.460 
my a minor there and then with my
fingers<00:05:34.280> I'm<00:05:34.520> just<00:05:34.940> kind<00:05:35.690> of<00:05:35.780> randomly

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
fingers I'm just kind of randomly

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.999 
fingers I'm just kind of randomly
selecting<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.430> rest<00:05:37.669> of<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:37.970> court<00:05:38.650> no<00:05:39.650> no

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
selecting the rest of the court no no

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.520 
selecting the rest of the court no no
real<00:05:40.340> science<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.240> other<00:05:41.449> than<00:05:41.690> that<00:05:42.020> what

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
real science to it other than that what

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.950 
real science to it other than that what
my<00:05:42.710> ear<00:05:42.919> is<00:05:43.069> telling<00:05:43.430> me<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.759> that<00:05:43.969> the<00:05:44.690> root

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
my ear is telling me is that the root

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.140 
my ear is telling me is that the root
notes<00:05:45.259> the<00:05:45.650> downbeats<00:05:46.159> want<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.490> be<00:05:46.610> low<00:05:46.849> and

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
notes the downbeats want to be low and

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.290 
notes the downbeats want to be low and
then<00:05:47.659> the<00:05:47.810> filler<00:05:48.909> are<00:05:49.909> going<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.090> be<00:05:50.180> the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
then the filler are going to be the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.600 
then the filler are going to be the
higher<00:05:50.539> pitch<00:05:50.900> notes<00:05:51.259> so<00:05:52.009> i<00:05:52.039> might<00:05:52.280> have<00:05:53.199> close

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
higher pitch notes so i might have close

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:03.219 
higher pitch notes so i might have close
by<00:05:59.319> only<00:06:00.319> for<00:06:00.680> a<00:06:00.710> moment<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.509> moment's

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
by only for a moment and the moment's

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.279 
by only for a moment and the moment's
gone

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.990 

so<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.440> gives<00:06:07.590> you<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.740> sense<00:06:08.039> of<00:06:08.310> how<00:06:08.669> you<00:06:08.729> can

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
so that gives you a sense of how you can

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.360 
so that gives you a sense of how you can
extend<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.780> baselines<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.620> how<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.100> can

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
extend the baselines and how you can

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.520 
extend the baselines and how you can
change<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:12.389> cords<00:06:12.900> around<00:06:13.050> just<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:13.500> little

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
change the cords around just a little

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.890 
change the cords around just a little
bit<00:06:13.889> in<00:06:14.039> order<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.669> create<00:06:14.880> that<00:06:15.300> movement

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
bit in order to create that movement

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.629 
bit in order to create that movement
that<00:06:15.960> really<00:06:16.259> gives<00:06:16.380> continuity<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.340> chord

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
that really gives continuity to a chord

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.100 
that really gives continuity to a chord
progression<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.180> really<00:06:18.690> gives<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:18.930> whole<00:06:19.050> new

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
progression and really gives a whole new

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.170 
progression and really gives a whole new
flavor<00:06:19.620> even<00:06:20.310> though<00:06:20.490> you're<00:06:20.699> sticking<00:06:21.150> with

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
flavor even though you're sticking with

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.879 
flavor even though you're sticking with
in<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.449> similar<00:06:21.810> chord<00:06:22.080> progression<00:06:22.560> to<00:06:22.740> many

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
in a similar chord progression to many

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.370 
in a similar chord progression to many
other<00:06:23.069> songs
