00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.149
 It's one of the things I'm practicing in the supervisor class right now . 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.540
 It is that you listen to the story of Hey opponent 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.540
 Well 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.189
 It today theme, for example, it is not it Is there the moment you think coaching Do not difficult 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.390
 People of client role in the surface I think you want to do a little says I coaching difficult 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.930
 Because 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.669
 May I ask you to say that the coach is a bit difficult 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 This do if I can I do was the more I wonder the I like that do difficult ttchingu it in it 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.940
 I hope when do I, for example, of the hotel was Masaru Tone to the Koch 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.940
 To come riding in'll have struck that they can towards it'm there Karaa unlikely 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.320
 This would be one way in the mean can also lead to say 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:48.710
 So please practice this too 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.610
 It's also difficult for coaches, but I really want to do something here eg what housework 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.700
 One of the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 During 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.480
 When it's empty, it's a high cup-like environment. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.100
 For example are you a little Te' Ya' Nante any Chinese characters if something happy in a concrete request so it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 Because to say that even sound part I it's a good one Jan'ii while listening to bought To why it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.479
 Any time I I do with or to be able close 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 What more can be done by putting out a resource gun on the side of processing + 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.580
 While saying 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.690
 Well then if you say what you 're going to do 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.310
 It's going to get bigger , so it's very forceful, but I want to go there soon 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.680
 Things are more as one technology, and this is one route, so it's an eye route I've climbed. 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 Another one of such routes 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:35.710
 Actually it is while matching, but it is not only just matching but it can be done from there 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.280
 There is a thing, but it is a little key It is important to look at me please do it 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 Well, let's start because it is difficult here, yes, coaching is difficult 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:02:00.259
 The idea meetings, etc. I I Why so I wonder if my head I'm here also difficult us a little more teaching 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:02:01.510
 Hey Oh Tsu refers to what Kaa' there breath leakage Chap al little Eros animation 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.110
 Oh 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 I agree 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.990
 Roughness is now out, but when I say the words that I told you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:30.810
 Hiarosu whether there here Kedon' was fully up what or motivation 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.819
 I wonder why 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.819
 It was good to do the action too Tape was soft and soft from the soft and such 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'm saying that I'm awake 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.210
 This person is in here 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.170
 It 's coming 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.650
 Actually if I want to cherish that say estuary it Toka I want to have this kind of coaching 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.480
 Or Toka I want this happens to the client Toka I want to be in this kind of coach 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.569
 Aren't you full ? 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.269
 right 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:02.599
 We really don't want to hear that, so it looks like there's a problem 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:07.280
 If you concentrate on the fourth set , why does this person really want to 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:10.260
 More clients get out of the pit with higher motivation 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.760
 Do speedy action 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.069
 Well 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.819
 There by yourself it to listen to can be in a variety talk client is concentrated it something more 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.540
 That's it 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.439
 Communicate densely on your own by listening to what the client says 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.269
 While taking 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:31.750
 And I think I want to do this with Goon at a much higher level 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:36.980
 I went to more than I thought out while saying in Tsu you try to go in Chaima 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.250
 It is what this person wants is that a report like that is coming back 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.030
 It's not a lie , we are not listening to that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.360
 What Aso or not this person 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.560
 Whether and I would think in my head without not you hear just talk 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.420
 In important keyword and if Toka I would lend the equipment it will do it is happening 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.710
 I do not know what to do 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.640
 This person is also saying 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.680
 I want to do this kind of session More clients 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.370
 Keep me motivated and take action more and more 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.810
 It it it from also happy getting around Nante yourself happy I'm leading a little while ago of maybe 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.290
 This person is I have feelings that say Datte I want to connect to the place Tteyuu become 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.239
 The 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.139
 Man without a problem consciousness say whether the why question'm also told while talking the problem is the problem 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.859
 Reason for not speaking 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.700
 Toka or there is an ideal and problem consciousness say from where born 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.680
 Because there is a standard that says this 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:31.759
 That's why I think there is an ideal person who is talking about the problem 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.759
 Whether or not to listen to such ideals are said in the problem 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.600
 If you listen in excuse will be rewarded to say in this kind of wind 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.949
 What more client's along or is causing more and more action to keep the motivation 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.229
 I would like to coach 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:47.700
 Ahh, I wish I could do it, but for that purpose I could listen to something more or more 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.890
 I thought so I do take communication in place 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.689
 Yeah Now I'm have been told what do you have what it thinks now 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.129
 After all 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.560
 To go I Ne Yeah Yeah say After also firmly cherishes the Anjou's working 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.370
 æ…¶ 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.770
 so 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:11.840
 After all, I see or do so in a patient's also a good idea the other two-and-a-half years Tteyuu I want to just this 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:19.460
 Important things If you really feel like you've shared something, it's certainly more action people 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:21.360
 This person Once you talk to the place Tteyuu I Mont Neepunyo went bought in what I I think that pop 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.009
 I also care about important things 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.650
 Hear What do you thing you want to do really question color is in So I touched with 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.880
 Also I'm so because the real's Dada leak 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.910
 Spear inside out the way of the problem to have been told that you want to do a lot himself is in the problem 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.910
 I'm such thing with in that we want to do that say this to say so because it wants 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:46.830
 This kind of thing that I want is whether you mean To Land, that wants to Toka 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:48.119
 If it turns out to be something like that, it's actually a door open to teleology 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.330
 It means that 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:51.779
 So fed back to the other party that the mind with in the opponent's story in such Fu 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.769
 Go 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.729
 I do is that I want as a rejection that I want to do a heart Toka such things 

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.150
 Said 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.050
 In the moment you said Jesus 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.700
 Of course I'm in airplane mode because I still can't access the problem. 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.200
 Direction tax 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:11.020
 You can see where you want to go and you can work towards it 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.720
 That way of hearing that things will happen that only a little is made 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.560
 Let ne ne Well Well now it Tteyuu 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.550
 Spear short frame ask to say Toka was a little thoughts that you have felt or heard Toka or look
