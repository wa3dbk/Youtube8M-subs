00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
kind of reminds me of the back of the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
kind of reminds me of the back of the
future<00:01:01.350> car<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:03.350> also<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> sitting<00:01:05.190> at<00:01:05.309> an

future car but also have a sitting at an

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.450 
future car but also have a sitting at an
angle<00:01:05.850> considering<00:01:06.510> i'm<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:07.980> paranoid

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
angle considering i'm very paranoid

about<00:01:08.880> heat<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> heat<00:01:10.380> rises<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.160> hopefully

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
about heat and heat rises so hopefully

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.900

Rises<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.580> playstation<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> little

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
Rises out of the playstation a little

Rises out of the playstation a little
bit<00:01:15.000> better<00:01:15.240> um<00:01:16.040> everything<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.190> hot<00:01:17.430> glued<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
bit better um everything is hot glued so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.970 
bit better um everything is hot glued so
i<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.690> rip<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.230> if<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> doesn't

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
i could just rip it off if it doesn't

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.200 
i could just rip it off if it doesn't
work<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.820> tired<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> and

work or if I get tired of it and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
work or if I get tired of it and
hopefully<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.600> results<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:27.979> now<00:01:28.979> as

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
