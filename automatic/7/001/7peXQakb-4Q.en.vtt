00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello dear visitors 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.990
 site subscribers and over com dot ru 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 in this video tutorial we will talk about 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.309
 why windows 7 is loading for a long time 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 or 8 many users in which 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 use windows operating system 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.570
 7 or 8 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 face the problem of long loading 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.930
 computer this can occur by 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 for various reasons and today I will tell you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.019
 Most Popular 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.789
 so if you have a long boot 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 windows then it can happen by 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.019
 the following reasons, the first startup 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 if you have with your computer right away 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 runs many skype mail.ru programs 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 agent torrent ICQ and so on then this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 is the main reason why u long 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 loading windows 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.989
 let's open with you autoload and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 make it so that when you turn on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 the computer does not run extra 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.250
 programs 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 go start and run the program 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 run or click on the keyboard 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 key combination win p open the window 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.350
 we need to register the command m seconds and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 press ok 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.820
 we will start the system configuration 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 here we need to go to the tab 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.379
 autoload and uncheck those 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.390
 programs that they should run 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 together with the computer, that is, we remove 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.210
 a program that is not used by us 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 immediately after turning on the computer 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.170
 I chose 10 programs represent 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.150
 now when you turn on the computer 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.920
 I will not wait until it starts 10 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.600
 programs and they will not always 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.070
 eat up computer resources 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 it remains to apply made changes 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.659
 press ok and restart the computer 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.580
 the second reason is a long load 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.100
 computer is a virus if your computer 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.990
 started loading slowly suddenly then 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.700
 maybe the virus has settled the system 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.170
 It is worth worrying because you can 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.850
 quickly find and delete 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 I advise to use for these purposes 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.200
 free software and doctor web under 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.000
 chick name and download this program you 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.220
 You can follow the link you see on your 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.020
 the screens also i will attach it in the description 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.050
 under this video here we need to click 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.050
 further accept the terms of the agreement and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.429
 wait until the program downloads weighs 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.409
 it is about 150 megabytes after downloading 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.420
 taught you chickens and run it and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.600
 scan your bye for availability 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.950
 Malware put a tick in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.959
 continue and press the start button 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.280
 check on completion delete all 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.110
 viruses found third reason 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 slow computer boot this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.660
 HDD 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.190
 if you have a slow hard drive 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.230
 Especially for laptops 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.239
 this may also be the cause of a long 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.430
 boot windows of course ideally 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.290
 you had to buy an ssd disk and install 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.510
 on it windows 8 it would speed up 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.709
 computer or laptop at least 5 times 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.230
 but if you can not buy 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.340
 speed ssd drive then i advise how 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.890
 at least defragment 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.930
 hard drive and also clean it from 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.250
 Different trash hard disk 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 greatly affects the download speed 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.980
 windows 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 so make sure that it is stable 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.570
 worked the fourth reason it's littered 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
 rest this advice follows from the previous one 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.810
 and he treats purely 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
 if you frequently install and uninstall 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.250
 various programs need to be cleaned 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 the registry in order to put it in order 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.970
 I advise a free program cut to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.739
 a link to download, I will attach to 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.720
 description under this video here we need 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.340
 go to the registry tab 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 press the problem search button 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.620
 after the program finds no 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.160
 we need to press the necessary record 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.990
 button 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 fix do this operation times 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.150
 two three until the program finds all 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.810
 possible problems 5 cleaning the computer 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.940
 from dust 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.680
 if your windows loads for a long time and 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.750
 at the same time your computer or laptop 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.700
 for several years now and you have still never 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.100
 not cleaned then it's time to do it 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.050
 ask people versed in this 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.390
 subject so that they clean the cooler and 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.450
 put on the processes of new thermal grease 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.580
 6 reinstall the system do not forget 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.710
 reinstall the system if you are many years 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.690
 do not reinstall windows then came 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.490
 it's time to do it every day working for 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.290
 computer he gradually clogged 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.700
 various data new programs 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.800
 temporary fans 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.230
 so on all this with time so much 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.090
 grows easier to complete 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.130
 reinstall the system and start from scratch 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.930
 the main thing before it is not to save save 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.830
 important system disk files on 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.380
 some other 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.630
 or for example on a USB flash drive or disk I wish 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.520
 you good luck in solving the problem with a long 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.800
 I hope with loading of Windows very soon 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.960
 you will find the main cause of slow 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.790
 run the computer if the video you 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.560
