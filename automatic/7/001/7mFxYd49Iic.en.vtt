with you guys whoever is saying that
because<00:01:04.080> yes<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.489> MW<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.060> point

five<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:08.250> mw2<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.770> much<00:01:11.010> better

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
five but i think mw2 was so much better

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
five but i think mw2 was so much better
than<00:01:11.430> black<00:01:11.670> ops<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.240> they're<00:01:13.140> bringing

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
