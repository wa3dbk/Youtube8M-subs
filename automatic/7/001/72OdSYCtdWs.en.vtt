00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.609
 what 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.950
 or the attraction in this kitchen easy my 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.299
 name is andy and today they 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.640
 I bring another recipe that is amazing 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.260
 for this February 14 is a very rich 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.299
 chocolate cake that is made in the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.010
 microwave so it's very fast and 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.750
 It is also made with oatmeal and 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.150
 flaxseed so it's also a little bit more 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.859
 healthy the preparation time and the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.690
 combined cooking time is less than 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.619
 5 minutes I hope this video will 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.619
 like, let's start 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.250
 the list of ingredients is in the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.050
 description of this video and also the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.240
 they will find in my blog where they can 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.370
 print the full recipe let's start 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.370
 let's mix flaxseed with 3 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.080
 tablespoons of water stir well for 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.140
 everything is well mixed and reserve 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.300
 in this mix for a moment 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.340
 Now in a bowl we are going to combine the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.280
 dry ingredients which are the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.100
 flour the sugar the cocoa the salt and the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.600
 baking powder but come back well 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.240
 until everything is well mixed and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.190
 reserve this for a moment 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 now let's combine the milk with the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 oil and this we are going to add 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.720
 also the flaxseed mixture also 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940
 add 2 more tablespoons of water and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560
 stir everything very well and since everything 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.660
 be well mixed now they are going to empty 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.310
 these ingredients on the mixture of the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.540
 flour 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 but come back all very well until 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.250
 everything is combined in a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.570
 I think the dough stayed a little bit 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.040
 thick so I'm going to add one 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.659
 more water scoop 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.399
 remember depending on the weather and the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.439
 where they live in the flour can be 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.000
 a little bit drier so if you believe it 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.220
 necessary can add a little 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.960
 more than water they stir everything well up 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.390
 everything is well incorporated and that is 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.850
 everything since the mix is â€‹â€‹ready now 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.409
 we can make the cupcakes remember 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.030
 for this recipe they need a mold that 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.009
 can be put in the microwave 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.990
 I am using this bowl that has 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.880
 heart shape and I will sprinkle 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.500
 a little bit of spray oil the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.899
 mixture is enough to make two 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.459
 cupcakes of the same size so I'm going 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.740
 to empty half of the mixture in the 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.130
 mold and then I'm going to cook it in the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.020
 microwave for 90 seconds 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.239
 and that's what it looks like after 90 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.980
 seconds is well fluffed now with 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.450
 a small knife go over all the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.760
 contour of the cupcake so that it 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.830
 detach easily from the mold and then 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.660
 they're going to flip him on his plate and they're going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.640
 let it cool completely before 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.590
 to decorate it while the cake is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 cool now I'm going to cook the second 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.569
 I'll cook it anyway 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.160
 the microwave for 90 seconds if the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.140
 cake is fought to get the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.209
 mold is that it still lacks some time 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.580
 to finish cooking so what 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.519
 can put another 15 or 30 seconds 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.049
 to the microwave and then now if they are going to 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.060
 go over the whole outline of the cake with 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.090
 the knife and then they will flip it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.010
 on your plate and that's how it looks like 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.380
 you can see it's really fluffy and it's not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.690
 Nothing dry like it is delicious as 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.130
 if it had been baked in the oven and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.500
 As I told you, it's going to let it cool down 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.730
 completely before decorating it for 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.190
 decorate it I'm just using 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.349
 melted chocolate I put the chocolate in 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.780
 a plastic bag and melt it in 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.660
 the microwave and then I'm decorating 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.099
 the cake moving zigzag and 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.170
 can decorate not only with 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.790
 dark chocolate or can also 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.069
 decorate it with chocolate 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.739
 and with dark chocolate that depends on 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.900
 you and that's all this is what it looks like 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.310
 truly it is beautiful is good 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 fast and delicious so be the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.030
 I recommend what I'm going to cut so they can see 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.890
 how it looks inside really that 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.650
 The same is very rich, it is well fluffed 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.599
 and it's not dry at all so it's the gift 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.799
 perfect for this February 14 I hope 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.799
