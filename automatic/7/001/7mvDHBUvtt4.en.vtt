00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
inspired the name because it was like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.889

the<00:00:38.610> arms<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.420> linked<00:00:39.719> together

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
like this here and I just thought that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
like this here and I just thought that
it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.559> excellent<00:00:43.980> name<00:00:44.899> because<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.079> what

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.100 
it was an excellent name because of what
it<00:00:46.469> embodied<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> symbolized<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:48.629> we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it embodied and symbolized I think we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.350 
it embodied and symbolized I think we
could<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.890> unity<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.640> let

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
could all use a little more unity so let

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.880

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
closed in you can move these all closer

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.710 
closed in you can move these all closer
together<00:03:51.639> but<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.699> kind<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.060> like<00:03:53.209> them<00:03:53.359> spread

together but I kind of like them spread

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.509 
together but I kind of like them spread
out<00:03:53.900> because<00:03:54.259> it<00:03:54.500> gives<00:03:54.680> more<00:03:54.859> of<00:03:55.040> like<00:03:55.310> that

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
out because it gives more of like that
