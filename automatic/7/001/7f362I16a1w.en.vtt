00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
bad because on the one hand you could

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
bad because on the one hand you could
say<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.620> removing<00:02:22.280> yourself<00:02:22.459> from<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
moment and it's contaminating the ride

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.840 
moment and it's contaminating the ride
but<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.140> other<00:02:30.230> hand<00:02:30.350> i<00:02:30.890> put<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.250> 10

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
but but on the other hand i put in 10

do that but there's anonymous there's an

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.160 
do that but there's anonymous there's an
odd<00:02:48.790> automatic<00:02:49.790> components<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.140> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
odd automatic components that that I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.570 
odd automatic components that that I
believe<00:02:51.470> i've<00:02:51.680> developed<00:02:54.430> momentum<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:55.519> I

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
believe i've developed momentum but I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.900 
believe i've developed momentum but I
just<00:02:55.790> said<00:02:55.970> earlier<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.400> would<00:02:58.489> be<00:02:58.610> grueling

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
just said earlier it would be grueling

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.050 
just said earlier it would be grueling
on<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> road<00:02:59.750> if<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.049> couldn't<00:03:00.549> enjoy<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.610> piece

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
on the road if I couldn't enjoy a piece
