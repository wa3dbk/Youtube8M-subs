okay while that's cooking I'm just going

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.720 
okay while that's cooking I'm just going
to<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.260> myself<00:02:16.440> some<00:02:16.830> parchment<00:02:17.099> paper<00:02:17.610> and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
to get myself some parchment paper and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.360 
to get myself some parchment paper and
place<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.599> here<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.470> as<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.860> cook<00:02:20.040> our<00:02:20.190> egg

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
place it here because as we cook our egg

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.009 
place it here because as we cook our egg
knits<00:02:20.640> will<00:02:21.000> take<00:02:21.269> them<00:02:21.480> off<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.629> put<00:02:21.840> them

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
onto our parchment paper so hopefully

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.040 
onto our parchment paper so hopefully
that<00:02:24.660> won't<00:02:24.780> blow<00:02:25.019> away<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> wind<00:02:27.050> okay

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
that won't blow away in the wind okay

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
let's have a look at it still not quite

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.759 
let's have a look at it still not quite
set<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.220> sets<00:02:32.660> you'll<00:02:33.660> find<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.650> you

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
set and as it sets you'll find that you

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.030 
set and as it sets you'll find that you
