time<00:04:07.920> period<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.579> think<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:10.139> guns

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.240 
time period I think that that the guns
from<00:04:10.799> like<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.669> 60<00:04:12.120> s<00:04:12.299> or<00:04:13.049> whatever<00:04:13.380> i<00:04:13.500> believe

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
reminds me of how it used to be you know

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.090 
reminds me of how it used to be you know
start<00:05:54.510> playing<00:05:54.750> xbox<00:05:55.020> or<00:05:55.350> like<00:05:55.530> Ted<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.070> you

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
start playing xbox or like Ted and you

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.930

don't<00:05:56.370> stop<00:05:56.760> till<00:05:57.030> two<00:05:58.100> because<00:05:59.100> it's<00:05:59.610> just<00:05:59.729> so

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
don't stop till two because it's just so

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.420 
don't stop till two because it's just so
fun<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:01.470> I<00:06:01.770> think<00:06:01.950> that's<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.130> way<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.400> game

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
fun and I think that's the way the game

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.140 
fun and I think that's the way the game
should<00:06:02.790> be<00:06:03.200> I<00:06:04.200> actually<00:06:05.190> deleted<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:05.970> map

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
should be I actually deleted the map

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.110 
should be I actually deleted the map
packs<00:06:06.479> or<00:06:07.229> one<00:06:07.500> of<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.680> map<00:06:07.830> packs<00:06:08.100> for<00:06:09.000> my

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
packs or one of the map packs for my
