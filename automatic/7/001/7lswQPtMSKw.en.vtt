00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
profession over the years has definitely

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.149 
profession over the years has definitely
evolved<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.180> artisan<00:01:41.719> movement<00:01:42.200> has

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
evolved because the artisan movement has

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.209 
evolved because the artisan movement has
really<00:01:43.450> changed<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.750> become<00:01:45.200> very<00:01:45.500> important

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
really changed and become very important

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.179 
really changed and become very important
in<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.520> past<00:01:46.700> couple<00:01:46.969> years<00:01:47.590> people<00:01:48.590> are

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
in the past couple years people are

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.740 
in the past couple years people are
branching<00:01:50.030> off<00:01:50.210> into<00:01:50.840> different<00:01:51.289> areas<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.799> my

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
branching off into different areas of my

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.319 
branching off into different areas of my
industry<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.079> you'll<00:01:54.829> get<00:01:55.039> more<00:01:55.149> people<00:01:56.149> that

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
industry so you'll get more people that

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.389 
industry so you'll get more people that
are<00:01:56.420> making<00:01:56.630> chocolate<00:01:57.259> more<00:01:57.890> people<00:01:58.250> that

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
are making chocolate more people that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.249 
are making chocolate more people that
are<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:58.640> making<00:01:58.820> bread<00:01:59.390> more<00:01:59.780> people<00:02:00.140> that

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
are just making bread more people that

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.889 
are just making bread more people that
are<00:02:00.320> just<00:02:00.649> making<00:02:00.890> candies<00:02:01.609> and<00:02:01.969> I<00:02:02.539> think<00:02:02.780> it

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
are just making candies and I think it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.020 
are just making candies and I think it
has<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> lot<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:03.979> with<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.609> artisan

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
has a lot to do with the artisan

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.490 
has a lot to do with the artisan
movement<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.420> craft<00:02:05.689> movement<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.320> people

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
movement the craft movement that people

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.650 
movement the craft movement that people
are<00:02:06.829> specializing<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:07.939> thing<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.509> one

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
are specializing in one thing and one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.430 
are specializing in one thing and one
thing<00:02:08.690> only<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:10.580> think<00:02:11.030> it's<00:02:11.120> great<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.510> love

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
thing only and I think it's great I love

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.890 
thing only and I think it's great I love
it<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:16.220> only<00:02:16.370> imagine<00:02:16.550> how<00:02:16.940> baking<00:02:17.750> was

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
it I can only imagine how baking was

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.400 
it I can only imagine how baking was
done<00:02:18.110> back<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.900> probably<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.380> be

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
done back then I probably would be

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.380 
done back then I probably would be
afraid<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.920> use<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> practices<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.090> they

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
afraid to use the practices that they

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.110 
afraid to use the practices that they
use

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
use

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.320 
use
but<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.959> could<00:02:25.950> probably<00:02:26.250> gather<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.090> think

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
but I could probably gather to think

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.750 
but I could probably gather to think
that<00:02:27.540> some<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> our<00:02:28.500> techniques<00:02:29.099> are<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.489> that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that some of our techniques are not that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.820 
that some of our techniques are not that
far<00:02:30.000> apart

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
far apart

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.050 
far apart
which<00:02:31.830> would<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.069> cool<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.549> really<00:02:32.819> actually

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
which would be cool to really actually

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:44.460 
which would be cool to really actually
go<00:02:33.420> back<00:02:33.599> in<00:02:33.750> time<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.140> find<00:02:34.290> out
