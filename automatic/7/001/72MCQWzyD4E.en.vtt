then others show the washstand or
elements<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.110> his<00:01:02.260> daily<00:01:02.620> ritual<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.489> daily

elements of his daily ritual and daily

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.930 
elements of his daily ritual and daily
life<00:01:04.680> appear<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.220> paintings<00:01:06.580> become<00:01:06.909> a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
life appear and the paintings become a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.870 
life appear and the paintings become a
little<00:01:07.090> bit<00:01:07.300> darker<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.280> period

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
little bit darker so this this period

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.840 
little bit darker so this this period
from<00:01:10.090> 28<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.600> 45<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.350> I<00:01:11.890> think<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.490> period<00:01:12.729> of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
from 28 to 45 is I think a period of

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.270 
from 28 to 45 is I think a period of
kind<00:01:13.360> of<00:01:13.420> transition<00:01:13.930> for<00:01:14.170> him<00:01:14.320> he's<00:01:15.040> looking

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
kind of transition for him he's looking

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.700 
kind of transition for him he's looking
a<00:01:15.580> little<00:01:15.729> bit<00:01:16.000> at<00:01:16.240> surrealism<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.500> see

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
a little bit at surrealism you do see

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.300 
a little bit at surrealism you do see
him<00:01:17.799> engaging<00:01:18.640> again<00:01:19.000> with<00:01:19.360> picasso<00:01:20.310> looking

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
him engaging again with picasso looking

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.110 
him engaging again with picasso looking
at<00:01:21.430> his<00:01:21.610> old<00:01:22.350> avant-garde<00:01:23.350> cubist<00:01:24.130> work<00:01:24.850> from

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
at his old avant-garde cubist work from

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.390 
at his old avant-garde cubist work from
the<00:01:25.210> teens<00:01:25.510> from<00:01:26.290> surrealism<00:01:26.979> you'll<00:01:27.130> see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
the teens from surrealism you'll see

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.000 
the teens from surrealism you'll see
fruit<00:01:28.030> bowls<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.690> look<00:01:28.900> like<00:01:29.110> they're<00:01:29.380> they

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
fruit bowls that look like they're they

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.830 
fruit bowls that look like they're they
have<00:01:30.040> teeth<00:01:30.460> you'll<00:01:31.090> see<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.330> kind<00:01:31.750> of

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
have teeth you'll see a kind of

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.530 
have teeth you'll see a kind of
calligraphic<00:01:32.530> or<00:01:32.890> curving<00:01:33.460> line<00:01:33.790> sometimes

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
calligraphic or curving line sometimes

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.680 
calligraphic or curving line sometimes
it's<00:01:34.810> very<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:36.130> automatic<00:01:36.970> writing<00:01:37.240> that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
it's very like automatic writing that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.109 
it's very like automatic writing that
you<00:01:37.840> would<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.290> surrealist<00:01:38.950> work<00:01:39.220> so

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
you would see in the surrealist work so

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.420 
you would see in the surrealist work so
you<00:01:40.180> see<00:01:40.420> him<00:01:40.570> trying<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.560> different

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
you see him trying on different

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.690 
you see him trying on different
approaches<00:01:43.150> we<00:01:43.960> were<00:01:44.080> able<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.380> x-ray<00:01:44.890> some<00:01:45.580> of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
approaches we were able to x-ray some of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.660 
approaches we were able to x-ray some of
the<00:01:45.760> paintings<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.810> show<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:48.520> least

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
the paintings in the show and at least

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.300 
the paintings in the show and at least
one<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.119> them<00:01:49.299> has<00:01:49.330> an<00:01:49.659> entirely<00:01:50.049> different

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
one of them has an entirely different

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.210 
one of them has an entirely different
still<00:01:51.310> life<00:01:51.520> composition<00:01:52.240> underneath<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
still life composition underneath the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.190 
still life composition underneath the
existing<00:01:54.880> painting<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.570> can't<00:01:55.780> see<00:01:56.020> that

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
existing painting and you can't see that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.859 
existing painting and you can't see that
well<00:01:56.950> with<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.310> naked<00:01:57.549> eye<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.360> we<00:01:58.509> x-rayed

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
well with the naked eye so we x-rayed

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.140 
well with the naked eye so we x-rayed
that<00:01:59.200> painting<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.280> wasn't<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.850> Brock

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
that painting and it wasn't that Brock

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.910 
that painting and it wasn't that Brock
was<00:02:01.600> poor<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.259> he<00:02:02.409> was<00:02:02.619> actually<00:02:02.710> quite

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
was poor that he was actually quite

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.180 
was poor that he was actually quite
successful<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.890> must<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.310> just<00:02:06.340> been

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
successful so so it must have just been

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.850 
successful so so it must have just been
an<00:02:09.190> appreciation<00:02:09.819> for<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:11.200> canvas<00:02:11.650> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
an appreciation for the the canvas and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.830 
an appreciation for the the canvas and
the<00:02:12.129> painting<00:02:12.610> itself<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.569> he<00:02:13.720> would

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the painting itself so he would

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.800 
the painting itself so he would
sometimes<00:02:14.019> flip<00:02:14.410> them<00:02:14.620> over<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.690> make<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> new

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
sometimes flip them over and make a new

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.440 
sometimes flip them over and make a new
composition<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.799> one<00:02:18.010> side<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.090> one

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
composition on one side so we have one

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.839 
composition on one side so we have one
double<00:02:19.900> sided<00:02:20.140> painting<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.250> earlier

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
double sided painting the earlier

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.020 
double sided painting the earlier
composition<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.720> upside<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.489> he<00:02:24.849> must

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
composition is upside down so he must

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.729 
composition is upside down so he must
have<00:02:25.120> flipped<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.750> painting<00:02:26.080> over<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.590> then

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
have flipped the painting over and then

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.089 
have flipped the painting over and then
made<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> dates<00:02:28.360> from<00:02:28.540> about<00:02:28.690> 1930<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.440> 33

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
made and it dates from about 1930 to 33

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.789 
made and it dates from about 1930 to 33
and<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.849> one<00:02:31.080> well<00:02:32.080> that's<00:02:32.470> called<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
and then the one well that's called the

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.410 
and then the one well that's called the
main<00:02:33.099> side<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.819> painting<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.269> 1939<00:02:35.310> in

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
main side of the painting is 1939 in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800 
main side of the painting is 1939 in
1938<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.900> 1939<00:02:38.580> Brock<00:02:39.580> painted<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.480> series<00:02:40.780> of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
1938 and 1939 Brock painted a series of

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.319 
1938 and 1939 Brock painted a series of
still<00:02:41.110> lives<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:42.250> skulls<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.180> they

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
still lives with skulls and they

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.509 
still lives with skulls and they
sometimes<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:43.870> rosary<00:02:44.290> beads<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:44.890> crosses

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
sometimes have rosary beads or crosses

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.270 
sometimes have rosary beads or crosses
it's<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.629> traditional<00:02:47.410> motif<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.099> call

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it's a traditional motif that we call

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's a traditional motif that we call
the<00:02:48.430> Vanitas<00:02:48.940> motif<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.379> art<00:02:50.680> historians<00:02:51.250> have

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the Vanitas motif so art historians have

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
the Vanitas motif so art historians have
suggested<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.660> skull<00:02:53.129> ambiguous<00:02:54.129> as

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
suggested that this skull ambiguous as

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.449 
suggested that this skull ambiguous as
it<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.910> could<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.780> reference<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.799> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
it is could be a reference to the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.050 
it is could be a reference to the
transience<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.209> life<00:02:58.410> during<00:02:59.410> World<00:02:59.620> War<00:02:59.709> two

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
transience of life during World War two

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.369 
transience of life during World War two
but<00:03:01.060> Brock<00:03:01.660> very<00:03:02.530> famously<00:03:03.340> said<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:05.200> know

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
but Brock very famously said you know

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.110 
but Brock very famously said you know
that<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.620> not<00:03:05.769> at<00:03:06.129> all<00:03:06.220> what<00:03:06.700> they<00:03:06.849> were<00:03:06.910> about

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
that is not at all what they were about

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.680 
that is not at all what they were about
they<00:03:07.780> were<00:03:07.840> simply<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:09.040> because<00:03:09.459> they<00:03:09.609> were

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
they were simply there because they were

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.240 
they were simply there because they were
three-dimensional<00:03:10.690> tactile<00:03:11.260> objects<00:03:12.099> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
three-dimensional tactile objects that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.960 
three-dimensional tactile objects that
you<00:03:12.400> touch<00:03:12.870> Brock<00:03:13.900> always<00:03:14.530> played<00:03:14.950> down<00:03:15.340> any

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you touch Brock always played down any

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
you touch Brock always played down any
connection<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:18.099> exterior<00:03:18.519> world<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
connection to the exterior world and the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.430 
connection to the exterior world and the
turbulence<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> moment<00:03:21.849> in<00:03:22.000> his<00:03:22.239> works<00:03:22.510> so

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
turbulence of the moment in his works so

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.339 
turbulence of the moment in his works so
this<00:03:24.069> is<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> question<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:25.090> know<00:03:25.329> pit<00:03:25.599> that<00:03:26.079> is

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
this is a question you know pit that is

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.770 
this is a question you know pit that is
posed<00:03:26.650> by<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.950> exhibition<00:03:27.639> what<00:03:28.389> is<00:03:28.599> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
posed by the exhibition what is the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.349 
posed by the exhibition what is the
relationship<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.639> know<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:31.060> don't

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
relationship and I you know we don't

relationship and I you know we don't
always<00:03:31.540> have<00:03:31.780> an<00:03:31.930> answer<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.980> that's<00:03:33.910> up<00:03:34.209> for
