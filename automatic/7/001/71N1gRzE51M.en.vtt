1950 P MFP copier and I've loaded it up
with<00:00:08.620> about<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:09.830> max<00:00:10.070> 100<00:00:10.550> sheets<00:00:10.760> in<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:11.540> ADF

we're just going to make a copy and see

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.419 
we're just going to make a copy and see
how<00:00:14.900> fast<00:00:15.170> it<00:00:15.410> goes<00:00:15.590> there<00:00:15.950> shouldn't<00:00:16.160> be<00:00:16.249> any

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:16.429 
how fast it goes there shouldn't be any

come around to the side as you can see

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.169 
come around to the side as you can see
there's<00:00:27.409> no<00:00:27.529> hesitation<00:00:27.679> in<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.369> printing<00:00:28.789> or

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
in the scanning this is how the machine

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.170 
in the scanning this is how the machine
should<00:00:36.559> operate<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:39.379> has<00:00:39.649> 3000<00:00:40.640> sheet<00:00:40.940> input

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180

should operate it has 3000 sheet input
capacity<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:43.460> also<00:00:43.489> has<00:00:43.850> a<00:00:43.879> 3000<00:00:44.539> sheet<00:00:44.719> output

minute<00:00:50.949> copying<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:53.089> scanning<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:55.219> machine

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
minute copying and scanning the machine

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.060 
minute copying and scanning the machine
has<00:00:55.730> dual<00:00:56.000> scanner<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:56.719> it's<00:00:56.870> scan<00:00:57.500> both<00:00:57.769> front

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
has dual scanner so it's scan both front

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.660 
has dual scanner so it's scan both front
and<00:00:58.160> back<00:00:58.309> side<00:00:58.670> at<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> same<00:00:59.059> time

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.820 

and<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.330> does<00:01:04.510> have<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> very<00:01:05.080> user-friendly

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
and it does have a very user-friendly

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.520 
and it does have a very user-friendly
interface<00:01:06.550> this<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.240> new<00:01:07.690> 90/50<00:01:08.350> user

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
interface this is the new 90/50 user

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.290 
interface this is the new 90/50 user
interface<00:01:08.979> there's<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.790> button<00:01:10.000> here<00:01:10.270> that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
interface there's a button here that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:24.300 
interface there's a button here that
will<00:01:10.600> open<00:01:10.690> up<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:12.460> different<00:01:12.820> options<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
will open up your different options so

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.650 
will open up your different options so
this<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.520> 100<00:01:24.670> pages<00:01:25.030> we're<00:01:25.330> going<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.540> get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
this is 100 pages we're going to get

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.630 
this is 100 pages we're going to get
through<00:01:25.869> here

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 

and<00:01:33.180> I'll<00:01:33.300> load<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.810> once<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and I'll load it back up once it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.600 
and I'll load it back up once it
finishes<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.100> show<00:01:35.280> there's<00:01:35.550> no

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
finishes just to show there's no

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:59.800 
finishes just to show there's no
hesitation<00:01:36.330> in<00:01:36.360> between<00:01:36.720> jobs

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.310 

and<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.130> model<00:02:01.430> has<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.790> stapler<00:02:02.690> stacker<00:02:03.020> on

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and this model has a stapler stacker on

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.760 
and this model has a stapler stacker on
it<00:02:03.500> if<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.130> get<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.900> just<00:02:05.900> stacker<00:02:06.200> version

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
it if you get a just stacker version

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.490 
it if you get a just stacker version
without<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.430> stapling<00:02:07.970> options<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.720> should

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
without the stapling options it should

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.550 
without the stapling options it should
speed<00:02:09.800> up<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.100> stacking<00:02:10.610> just<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.970> hair

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
speed up the stacking just a hair

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
speed up the stacking just a hair
because<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.709> doesn't<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:14.860> group<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
because it doesn't have to group the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
because it doesn't have to group the
pages<00:02:17.420> together<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:19.130> would<00:02:19.250> be<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
pages together so that would be the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.100 
pages together so that would be the
model<00:02:19.640> you'd<00:02:19.760> want<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:22.930> now<00:02:23.930> we're

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
model you'd want to go with now we're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.990 
model you'd want to go with now we're
out<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:25.400> I'm<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.610> let<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.790> finish

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
out here so I'm going to let it finish

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.040 
out here so I'm going to let it finish
up<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:28.280> done<00:02:28.520> now

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
up it's done now

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.090 
up it's done now
see<00:02:30.050> there<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.260> wasn't<00:02:30.560> any<00:02:30.800> delay

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
see there really wasn't any delay

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.020 
see there really wasn't any delay
between<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:33.519> copying<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> scanning<00:02:37.030> so

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
between the copying and the scanning so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.430 
between the copying and the scanning so
we're<00:02:38.150> getting<00:02:38.330> another<00:02:38.450> 100<00:02:38.840> sheets<00:02:39.050> here

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.360 

load<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.739> ADF<00:02:46.600> hit<00:02:47.600> start<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.370> it'll

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
load it in the ADF hit start and it'll

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.790 
load it in the ADF hit start and it'll
be<00:02:49.459> off

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.030 

as<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.730> see<00:02:53.940> there's<00:02:54.180> really<00:02:55.040> no

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
as you can see there's really no

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.340 
as you can see there's really no
hesitation<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.760> between<00:02:57.060> jobs<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.780> while<00:02:58.110> it's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
hesitation in between jobs or while it's

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.640 
hesitation in between jobs or while it's
scanning<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> printing<00:02:58.920> and<00:03:00.470> we<00:03:01.470> are

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
scanning and printing and we are

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.590 
scanning and printing and we are
scanning<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.310> regular<00:03:02.700> invoice<00:03:03.300> type

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
scanning just regular invoice type

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.550 
scanning just regular invoice type
documents<00:03:08.480> I'm<00:03:09.480> guessing<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.260> similar

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
documents I'm guessing this is similar

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.730 
documents I'm guessing this is similar
to<00:03:10.710> what<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.950> guys<00:03:11.100> would<00:03:11.310> be<00:03:11.370> doing
