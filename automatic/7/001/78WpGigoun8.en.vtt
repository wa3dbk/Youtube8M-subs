they<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.280> giga-brilliant<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
they have to make a a giga-brilliant and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
they have to make a a giga-brilliant and
then<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:15.810> its<00:01:15.990> effect<00:01:16.080> twice<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
then use its effect twice to get over it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.679 
then use its effect twice to get over it
and<00:01:17.280> discover<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> effect<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> once<00:01:18.509> with

home<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.229> target<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> card<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
home you can target a you a card and the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399 
home you can target a you a card and the
continents<00:01:21.119> drove<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> pedal<00:01:21.659> bike<00:01:21.780> artifacts

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
continents drove a pedal bike artifacts

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.039 
continents drove a pedal bike artifacts
and<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.820> off<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.869> cut

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and so you just get off as they cut

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
and so you just get off as they cut
really<00:01:25.259> can't<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
really can't get over it and if the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.080 
really can't get over it and if the
artifact<00:01:27.180> tech<00:01:27.420> 3<00:01:28.290> multaq<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.610> beagle<00:01:29.880> tap

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
artifact tech 3 multaq to beagle tap

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
artifact tech 3 multaq to beagle tap
because<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> let

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
because that's pretty much if you let

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.100 
because that's pretty much if you let
you<00:01:31.979> running<00:01:32.250> everything<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.450> artifacts

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you running everything now use artifacts

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.770 
you running everything now use artifacts
because<00:01:34.619> tribute<00:01:35.610> summoning<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> big

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because tribute summoning is also a big

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
because tribute summoning is also a big
theme<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> stack<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.579> great<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.030> able

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
theme the stack and it's great be able

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
theme the stack and it's great be able
to<00:01:39.299> pop<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.720> opponent<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.650> tribute
