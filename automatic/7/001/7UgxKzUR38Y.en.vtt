00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.030
 [Music] 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:11.200
 [Applause] 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:15.340
 [Music] 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:19.599
 hello to everyone well from the show a group 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.430
 filtration and suction 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.790
 tiny pool 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.030
 where the parts of which it is composed is a 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.950
 maneuvering table a sand filter 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.240
 with your manometer 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.240
 a selector key 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 The motor bo moto pump suction and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.949
 of impulsion and then all the fittings 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.949
 that carries drain bottom 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 and another for 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.940
 suction or clean bottom 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 another for the drive 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.200
 and he writes 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.200
 well the operation 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.550
 It can be automatic or manual 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.320
 then once decided 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.070
 for example there is the normal position that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.070
 it is filtration 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 in this case 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.390
 Water aspiration comes from the bottom 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 passes through the entrance of the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.720
 motor pump 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.600
 continue through the tube enters 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.290
 a selector valve 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.830
 by this tube it passes to the filter with the other 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.440
 return 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.350
 and it comes back from the valve 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.740
 selector goes directly to the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.720
 pool by the impulse tube is the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 normal operating form 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 this for several hours or days comes to 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.250
 create a layer here on top 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.240
 that can prevent it from working 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 perfectly raise the pressure here 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.570
 because the water can not get out to the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.560
 pool and then we need to clean it 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.620
 to do that every time for 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.310
 we have to come and put the valve 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.500
 selector 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.840
 put it in wash once it's in 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 this position 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.330
 we arrived to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.530
 to the engine 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 and what you are doing right now 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.470
 for this tube of blood and for this 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.340
 glass tube that we have here 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.330
 we are watching the water go by and if it is 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.570
 transparent is that the water is already 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.290
 clean and automatically goes out there 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.490
 down the drain and going 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.750
 outward 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.750
 this is for the hand 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.650
 we stop and now imagine that we want 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.690
 do a cleaning then we put it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.370
 in drainage 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.290
 in this way it does not pass through the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.300
 filter we could put it in filtration and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.890
 clean will pass through the filter but 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.640
 if we put it in the drain what we do 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.130
 is to give it more strength 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.960
 to pool cleaner then what we do 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.410
 is we open the key of the clean bottom 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.420
 we closed the skimmer 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.750
 and the fund also 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.670
 with this the only entrance of the water is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.340
 clean funds like this vacuum cleaner 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.660
 up is going to have a lot of power the water 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.270
 is going to come here enters the engine 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.500
 and automatically from here 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.780
 [Applause] 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.270
 for the street 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.040
 we will see it also go through here and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.430
 depends on the solution you have then 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.269
 we want to spend 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.030
 Cleaner or more turbid the water if 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.469
 we observe the manometer is zero in 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.830
 this we have to be careful not 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:04.260
 leave it a long time because 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.570
 we can not stay and it's going to be quite the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.420
 pool and very important if you do not have 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.730
 cleaner above this key has to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.310
 always be always closed lest 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.739
 Some child is getting involved 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.420
 that when operating can 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.320
 fix it 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.000
 all right 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.780
 once we have done 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.200
 both this background cleaning and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.200
 as well 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.280
 the filtration and we want to clean it 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.120
 that is the sand we have another point where 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.270
 that rinse here in the rinse we put 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.090
 also running the engine and what it does 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.740
 is to be circulating the water for both 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.360
 sites and washing 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.639
 what is the sand all this dirty water 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.400
 it goes to the outside also with this 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.380
 that we get that little dirt that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.610
 has stayed here accumulated in the 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.580
 moment that we put it again on 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.900
 filtration I did not go inside the 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.380
 pool well 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.430
 we stop and we see another possibility that 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.949
 has the circulation with this the only thing 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.110
 What we do is give a lot of power to 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.110
 suction motor 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.670
 we give you the maximum power enters 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.190
 directly and with the same goes through the 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.630
 impulsion tube does not enter through the 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.510
 filter so the power is a 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.950
 little bit bigger and this comes in 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.480
 directly in the water streams and 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.930
 this for example to give us a 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.610
 back massage comes in handy 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.199
 with this is not filtering the o 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.520
 simply the water that it takes and returns 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.520
 again to enter directly 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.490
 we stopped 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.550
 and the last one that we have left is the one 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.129
 closed this is the position that you have 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.270
 to be prolonged as in 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.499
 Stop the team of the group or 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.710
 simply by itself we have to do 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:12.129
 sand cleaning or there is some problem 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.050
 of some leak block what is good 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.419
 well with this I think more or less 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.770
 explained the functioning of a group 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:23.999
 small of a pool this is with tube 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.870
 of 50 and the valve is tiny but 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:31.280
 perfectly does the function 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.190
 well with this I finish 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.260
 we put it in filtration let's leave 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.480
 a while 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.400
 and it is working by the way 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.730
 we have a pressure that we always have 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.220
 to control between 0 5 and 1 bar if 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.870
 is above another manometer are they 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.820
 in red color and the green color if it is 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.390
 above means that the filter is 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.460
 obstructed or is quite blind and is 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.770
 need to clean it that's very 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.780
 important because we can spoil the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.050
 engine filter or burst some 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.659
 pipeline 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.480
 very well thank you very much and even the 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:06.520
 next 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.160
 [Applause] 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.270
 [Music] 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:18.070
