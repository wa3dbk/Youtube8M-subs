00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
something like that we're going to use a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.150 
something like that we're going to use a
few<00:00:41.600> more<00:00:41.660> commands<00:00:42.290> as<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:42.650> get<00:00:42.829> away<00:00:43.100> from

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
few more commands as we get away from

smaller<00:00:43.880> boats<00:00:44.210> into<00:00:44.510> larger<00:00:44.870> boats<00:00:45.110> it's

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
smaller boats into larger boats it's

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.400 
smaller boats into larger boats it's
important<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.270> helmsman<00:00:47.630> control<00:00:48.230> the

important that the helmsman control the
entire<00:00:48.770> sequence<00:00:49.210> which<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.239> why<00:00:50.510> we<00:00:50.720> add<00:00:50.870> an

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
entire sequence which is why we add an

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.650 
entire sequence which is why we add an
extra<00:00:51.320> command<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.920> centering<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.640> main<00:00:52.880> so

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
extra command of centering the main so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.880 
extra command of centering the main so
the<00:00:53.720> commands<00:00:54.050> I'm<00:00:54.200> going<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.410> use<00:00:54.530> today<00:00:54.680> are

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the commands I'm going to use today are

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.760
