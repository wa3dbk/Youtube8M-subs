00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
but that there will be many

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.000 
but that there will be many
opportunities<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.510> bridge<00:01:39.900> between<00:01:40.500> those

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
opportunities to bridge between those

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.540 
opportunities to bridge between those
those<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.680> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> fun<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.010> organise

something<00:01:44.820> around<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.450> idea<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.950> one

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

through which water used to pass and for
me<00:02:32.400> they<00:02:32.640> indicate<00:02:33.450> everything<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.200> true

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470

about<00:02:34.620> Toronto<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.700> fact<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
about Toronto the fact that you have to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140 
about Toronto the fact that you have to
work<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.020> harder<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.620> discover<00:02:38.220> what's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
work a little harder to discover what's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.090 
work a little harder to discover what's
here<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.500> part<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> reason

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
here I think this is part of the reason

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.830 
here I think this is part of the reason
that<00:02:41.280> people<00:02:41.460> read<00:02:41.880> because<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.450> desire

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that people read because they desire

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.760 
that people read because they desire
this<00:02:43.530> type<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.770> individual<00:02:44.490> connection<00:02:45.480> and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
this type of individual connection and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.380 
this type of individual connection and
yet<00:02:46.770> there<00:02:46.950> are<00:02:47.100> not<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.610> many<00:02:47.670> events<00:02:48.150> which

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
yet there are not so many events which

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.260 
yet there are not so many events which
actually<00:02:48.600> give<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.860> opportunity<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.700> so

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
actually give that opportunity and so

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.030 
actually give that opportunity and so
that's<00:02:51.569> what<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.620> makes

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that's what I think really really makes

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.559 
that's what I think really really makes
