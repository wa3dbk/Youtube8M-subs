 hello how about youtube friends I hope 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.620
 it is going very, very well 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.720
 health led from the canal yo 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.460
 in this video tutorial of a series of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.619
 tutorials that I was delivering on the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.570
 adobe photoshop program 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.140
 let's see how to eliminate imperfections 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.050
 of a person's skin and also that 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.610
 The skin looks clean and natural c2a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.290
 OK we start 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.370
 The first thing we are going to do is open 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.840
 our photoshop programs 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 let's go here file open and open 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.820
 a picture that we want 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.260
 The first thing we are going to do is duplicate 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.930
 the layer 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 let's go here to the layers menu 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.950
 where is the background layer we click on 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.890
 duplicate right 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.130
 let's see ok little control j also what 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.020
 we can do once this step is done 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.370
 let's go to our bar 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.910
 tools 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.630
 and we will choose in the tool 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.020
 Spot correction brush 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.189
 let's correct some imperfections 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.189
 this size is fine 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.400
 and once this is done 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 let's go to our menu bar 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.900
 filter 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670
 I have run 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.680
 to see the goats 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.860
 here it distorts us a bit 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.500
 image let's give it a radius of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.770
 5 pixels on the threshold of a station 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.840
 gonzÃ¡lez ok once this step is finished 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.800
 we go again to the menu of 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.450
 layers and we add a mask here 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.930
 already being with the layer mask 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.760
 we go to our tools menu and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.760
 we choose a suitcase bracelet 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.079
 we should have here in the part where 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.680
 are the colors that the front color 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.680
 be him 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.220
 we reduce our brush 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 14 episodes stadiums 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.200
 let's start to outline 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.930
 the eyes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.540
 to clarify them again 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.959
 on the part of the eye brows 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.959
 mouth 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.500
 and the part that interests us the most 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.500
 stay here 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.940
 of the nose 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.300
 to them that the image is the most natural 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.300
 possible 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.299
 mouth 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.110
 after done this step we are going to 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:49.560
 enlarge the brush 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.560
 with 30 functions and we're going to 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.640
 paint as it were the detail 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.640
 for prices 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.140
 arrange the image smoothly here 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.140
 but here 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.739
 the part of the ears 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.739
 and the beard 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.039
 the herbs that we do not have cable 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.039
 so notorious 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 her dress 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.950
 we must have the left right of 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.210
 pressed mouse 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.210
 when we do this 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.510
 little is missing here 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.230
 once having this we are going to go 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.620
 again 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.220
 blur the ocean 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.220
 and lakes 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.980
 has improved key a bit 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.280
 there are 5 pixels ok 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.840
 and here we have our finished image 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.840
 if we want to see it 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.689
 we will see a before and after him 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.349
 we click here 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.950
 and we remove this little one here is the 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.150
 image as 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.040
 we open and here is the finished image 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.240
 I believe that the change is 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.240
 and not only for a lot 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.980
 ok once finished then we're going to 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.580
 click on the case of the fund that we want 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.580
 the shift key 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.370
 we click on the 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:27.620
 cappa fund and me without more than 34 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.540
 and we have only one image left 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.540
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.040
