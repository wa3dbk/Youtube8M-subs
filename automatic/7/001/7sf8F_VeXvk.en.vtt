fellow in synthetic biology Rd at the

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.130 
fellow in synthetic biology Rd at the
beginning<00:00:15.789> we<00:00:15.940> were<00:00:16.059> developing<00:00:16.360> cloning

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
beginning we were developing cloning

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.880 
beginning we were developing cloning
vectors<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.890> old<00:00:18.009> PC<00:00:18.369> DNA<00:00:18.759> vectors<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.740> was

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
vectors the old PC DNA vectors that was

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.650 
vectors the old PC DNA vectors that was
all<00:00:21.009> restriction<00:00:21.580> enzymes<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.330> then<00:00:22.480> we

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
all restriction enzymes and then we

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.260 
all restriction enzymes and then we
moved<00:00:22.900> into<00:00:22.990> gateway<00:00:23.619> that<00:00:24.279> made<00:00:24.669> cloning

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
moved into gateway that made cloning

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.270 
moved into gateway that made cloning
that<00:00:25.570> much<00:00:25.750> easier<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.410> much<00:00:26.980> more<00:00:27.040> rapid

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.400 

we<00:00:32.210> started<00:00:32.540> working<00:00:32.630> with<00:00:32.870> gateway

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
we started working with gateway

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.760 
we started working with gateway
technology<00:00:34.130> in<00:00:34.310> 2001<00:00:35.120> at<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.989> time<00:00:36.260> there<00:00:36.650> was

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
technology in 2001 at the time there was

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.890 
technology in 2001 at the time there was
a<00:00:36.800> standard<00:00:37.550> cloning<00:00:37.970> technology<00:00:38.540> which<00:00:38.750> is

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
a standard cloning technology which is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.290 
a standard cloning technology which is
restriction<00:00:39.470> enzyme<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:39.980> ligase<00:00:40.400> and<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.180> was

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
restriction enzyme and ligase and it was

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.660 
restriction enzyme and ligase and it was
very<00:00:41.450> difficult<00:00:41.780> sometimes<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.620> move<00:00:43.010> pieces

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
very difficult sometimes to move pieces

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.420 
very difficult sometimes to move pieces
of<00:00:44.030> DNA<00:00:44.230> from<00:00:45.230> vector<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.800> vector

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
of DNA from vector to vector

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.430 
of DNA from vector to vector
gateway<00:00:46.940> technology<00:00:47.629> said<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.080> new

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
gateway technology said of a new

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.950 
gateway technology said of a new
paradigm<00:00:48.739> for<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.280> customer<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:50.390> allowed

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
paradigm for the customer that allowed

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.750 
paradigm for the customer that allowed
them<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.290> freedom<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:51.770> move<00:00:52.070> pieces<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.580> DNA

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
them the freedom to move pieces of DNA

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.460 
them the freedom to move pieces of DNA
around<00:00:53.239> into<00:00:53.629> different<00:00:53.870> vectors<00:00:54.260> very

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
around into different vectors very

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.729 
around into different vectors very
easily<00:00:54.769> and<00:00:55.660> once<00:00:56.660> they<00:00:56.900> got<00:00:57.110> clear<00:00:57.470> on<00:00:57.620> the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
easily and once they got clear on the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.280 
easily and once they got clear on the
concept<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:58.430> was<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.120> uptake<00:00:59.540> was<00:00:59.720> very<00:00:59.960> quick

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
concept it was the uptake was very quick

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.490 
concept it was the uptake was very quick
and<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.430> labs<00:01:01.760> were<00:01:02.030> really<00:01:02.390> using<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:03.019> gateway

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
and and labs were really using a gateway

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.660 
and and labs were really using a gateway
to<00:01:03.680> move<00:01:04.390> move<00:01:05.390> genes<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.610> fragments<00:01:07.610> of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
to move move genes and and fragments of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.510 
to move move genes and and fragments of
DNA<00:01:08.149> from<00:01:08.869> one<00:01:09.080> vector<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.500> another<00:01:09.619> in<00:01:10.399> a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
DNA from one vector to another in a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.030 
DNA from one vector to another in a
really<00:01:10.820> high<00:01:10.970> throughput<00:01:11.270> manner<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:12.830> it

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
really high throughput manner so it

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.999 
really high throughput manner so it
really<00:01:13.430> allowed<00:01:13.759> cloning<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.390> entire<00:01:14.920> what<00:01:15.920> we

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
really allowed cloning of entire what we

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.779 
really allowed cloning of entire what we
call<00:01:16.220> orphée<00:01:16.670> ohms<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.270> open<00:01:17.810> reading<00:01:17.990> frames

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
call orphée ohms of open reading frames

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.580 
call orphée ohms of open reading frames
from<00:01:19.789> different<00:01:20.180> organisms<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:21.140> very<00:01:21.440> high

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
from different organisms in very high

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.730 
from different organisms in very high
throughput<00:01:22.300> from<00:01:23.300> one<00:01:23.570> vector<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.990> another<00:01:24.470> so

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
throughput from one vector to another so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.790 
throughput from one vector to another so
it<00:01:24.800> really<00:01:25.009> enabled<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.550> new<00:01:25.670> paradigm<00:01:26.149> of<00:01:26.180> of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
it really enabled a new paradigm of of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.310 
it really enabled a new paradigm of of
gene<00:01:27.800> expression<00:01:27.830> tools<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.930> we<00:01:30.080> did

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
gene expression tools what we did

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.040 
gene expression tools what we did
further<00:01:30.770> from<00:01:31.160> that<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:31.810> developed<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
further from that is we developed the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.670 
further from that is we developed the
multi-site<00:01:33.830> gateway<00:01:34.220> system<00:01:34.490> which<00:01:34.880> allows

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
multi-site gateway system which allows

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.620 
multi-site gateway system which allows
assembly<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.770> multiple<00:01:37.280> different<00:01:37.630> DNA

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
assembly of multiple different DNA

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.570 
assembly of multiple different DNA
fragments<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.380> single<00:01:39.740> reaction<00:01:40.010> into<00:01:40.549> a

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
fragments in a single reaction into a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.660 
fragments in a single reaction into a
completely<00:01:41.240> very<00:01:41.900> complex<00:01:42.670> expression

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
completely very complex expression

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550 
completely very complex expression
vector<00:01:44.090> something<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.960> couldn't<00:01:45.229> be<00:01:45.320> done

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
vector something that couldn't be done

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.460 
vector something that couldn't be done
with<00:01:45.860> restriction<00:01:46.490> enzymes<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.119> ligase<00:01:47.540> so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
with restriction enzymes and ligase so

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.310 
with restriction enzymes and ligase so
it<00:01:48.590> essentially<00:01:49.040> enabled<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.970> time

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
it essentially enabled at the time

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.690 
it essentially enabled at the time
construction<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.439> these<00:01:51.619> really<00:01:52.310> useful

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
construction of these really useful

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.730 
construction of these really useful
constructs<00:01:53.390> for<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.689> customer

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.520 

well<00:01:58.250> we<00:01:58.370> have<00:01:58.549> a<00:01:58.940> family<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.780> entry<00:02:00.140> vectors

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
well we have a family of entry vectors

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.620 
well we have a family of entry vectors
which<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.890> where<00:02:01.130> where<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.790> system<00:02:02.150> starts

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
which is where where the system starts

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
which is where where the system starts
so<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.960> clone<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> piece<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.860> DNA<00:02:04.130> into<00:02:04.250> an<00:02:04.490> three

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
so we clone a piece of DNA into an three

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.690 
so we clone a piece of DNA into an three
vector<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.750> there's<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.260> very<00:02:06.950> large<00:02:07.340> family

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
vector then there's a very large family

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.790 
vector then there's a very large family
of<00:02:07.940> what<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.179> call<00:02:08.330> destination<00:02:09.110> vectors<00:02:09.530> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
of what we call destination vectors and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.420 
of what we call destination vectors and
these<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.130> expression<00:02:10.759> vectors<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:12.220> any<00:02:13.220> of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
these are expression vectors for any of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.559 
these are expression vectors for any of
many<00:02:13.880> different<00:02:14.120> hosts<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.760> allow<00:02:17.060> it's

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
many different hosts so that allow it's

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.570 
many different hosts so that allow it's
easy<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.989> transfer<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> piece<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.890> DNA<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.520> one

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
easy to transfer a piece of DNA from one

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.470 
easy to transfer a piece of DNA from one
vector<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.209> another<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.100> there's<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
vector to another to do that there's a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.960 
vector to another to do that there's a
enzymes<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.600> are<00:02:23.720> called<00:02:23.870> clone<00:02:24.140> aces<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
enzymes that are called clone aces and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820 
enzymes that are called clone aces and
so<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.510> go<00:02:26.630> from<00:02:26.750> entry<00:02:27.140> vector<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
so we can go from entry vector to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.520 
so we can go from entry vector to
destination<00:02:28.430> vector<00:02:28.640> using<00:02:28.910> LR<00:02:29.390> cloning<00:02:29.810> we

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
destination vector using LR cloning we

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.940 
destination vector using LR cloning we
can<00:02:30.709> go<00:02:30.890> from<00:02:31.750> PCR<00:02:32.750> product<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.410> entry<00:02:33.769> vector

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
can go from PCR product to entry vector

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.400 
can go from PCR product to entry vector
using<00:02:34.310> BP<00:02:34.910> cloning<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> reaction<00:02:36.230> goes

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
using BP cloning so the reaction goes

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.180 
using BP cloning so the reaction goes
backward<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.580> goes<00:02:38.120> both<00:02:38.360> directions<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.980> then

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
backward it goes both directions so then

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.490 
backward it goes both directions so then
there's<00:02:40.610> basically<00:02:41.330> entry<00:02:41.810> destination

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
there's basically entry destination

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.229 
there's basically entry destination
vectors<00:02:42.890> there<00:02:43.519> were<00:02:43.640> two<00:02:43.760> Club<00:02:43.940> donor

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
vectors there were two Club donor

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.770 
vectors there were two Club donor
vectors<00:02:44.810> for<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.620> creating<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:47.390> creating

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
vectors for for creating for creating

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.270 
vectors for for creating for creating
entry<00:02:48.050> vectors<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:48.860> there's<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.160> whole

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
entry vectors and then there's the whole

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.220 
entry vectors and then there's the whole
series<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.790> enzymes<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.600> along<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:50.900> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
series of enzymes that go along with it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.300 
series of enzymes that go along with it
to<00:02:51.350> make<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.620> easy<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.180> operations

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.339 

there<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.090> several<00:02:58.540> systems<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.050> kind<00:02:59.290> of

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
there are several systems that kind of

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.080 
there are several systems that kind of
approach<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.920> do<00:03:00.040> part<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.640> what<00:03:00.849> what

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
approach and do part of what what

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.699 
approach and do part of what what
Gateway<00:03:01.480> does<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.959> think<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.349> Gateway

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
Gateway does but I think the Gateway

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.120 
Gateway does but I think the Gateway
system<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.360> much<00:03:04.660> broader<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.140> more<00:03:05.709> useful

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
system is a much broader and more useful

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.440 
system is a much broader and more useful
technology<00:03:06.730> than<00:03:06.880> anything<00:03:07.120> that's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
technology than anything that's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:25.900 
technology than anything that's
currently<00:03:08.440> out<00:03:08.560> there

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.970
