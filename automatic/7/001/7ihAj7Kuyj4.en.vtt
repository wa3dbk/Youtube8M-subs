00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 very good to all the kids and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 remember v2 and good guys 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.009
 time that a chapter of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.520
 tricks and tips good this is because 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.330
 they asked me how the barrier moves 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.250
 good 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 I understand that most people 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.790
 you already know all the movements that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 can do the barrier myself just in case 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.630
 as always there are people who do not know 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
 well he knows how to do some things 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.809
 but he does not know anything worth it let's go 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 to the training camp we are going to press 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 select and we will choose a fault as 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 You know when you come here, you can 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
 train train or create plays 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.650
 rehearsed and others good in this case 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.239
 let's put a good foul no matter what 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.809
 the distance and he has put 22 meters 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.930
 ok and let's go to do with the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.690
 I will teach you part 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.540
 so you can see how you can control 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 let's say the rival team is worth good 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.510
 You see we put the fault and let's go 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.030
 to choose side but it will not come out that way 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.550
 and it's good this way I put it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 as an example that we will not leave 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
 so what we have to do is now in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.660
 this moment is when we would have to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.400
 press select vale and choose the side 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.640
 just when we're going to throw the foul 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.740
 well let's do it correctly ok 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 let's do it right 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.370
 just when we're going to throw the foul 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 ok let's press the select button that 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.660
 is that there so that does not come out that other 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.530
 that other menu that is on the left and 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.790
 let's choose choose side we choose the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.660
 the defending team and then we can already 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 control us the defense is good 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.160
 well you see that pressing rbr one on 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 Playstation 3 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.300
 the barrier is advanced by giving small 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.030
 tap each tap you give him 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 will take a little step forward you have to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.660
 be careful because the referee by 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 advance the barrier you can get 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.069
 yellow card 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.920
 again 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.510
 we choose the side we say defense team 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 and you see as if giving him little touches 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.689
 the r &amp; b is advancing the barrier 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.859
 ok and good to defend this we 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.859
 it can come pretty good 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.240
 well we have seen how the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.310
 barrier now let's make it jump the 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.110
 barrier is valid so that when they want you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.690
 throw a foul over the barrier 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
 with a jump, you can block the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 ball that goes to door as you get 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.100
 this is good as you are going to see now 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.080
 ok by pressing the button and in xbox or 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.360
 triangle in playstation3 one as the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 barrier jumps I will do repeated for 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.590
 that for you to see it is worth pressing and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.290
 Greek or triangle 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.769
 it's how you get the barrier to jump 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.379
 will even give them maybe it 's good there 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.750
 you see how the barrier jumps is worth 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.670
 untimely is worth because you dare say 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.000
 cheated with the second with the second 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 pitcher 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.800
 well now let's move forward to a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.140
 man in the barrier is worth it and for that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.070
 let's press ok let's do what 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.350
 what have we been doing so far 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.410
 It is worth choosing the side to be able to defend 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.400
 the lack is worth you see how 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.560
 a player will come out to defend the shot 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.270
 or even the pass in this case goes to 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.630
 defend the shot now I'm going to put 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.790
 another example of how going to see 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.680
 like to go defend the pass when 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.720
 see that he does not pass it will defend the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.460
 shot is not worth you see it now I'm going 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.440
 to put a little bit in slow motion and the 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.420
 left I leave the zoom that is the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.210
 player that's going to come out let's push 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.580
 ok and you see how it goes first to 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.320
 cover the pass and then realize 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.020
 it's not going to happen that he's going to throw and 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.910
 go back to cover 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.070
 the side where you are going to throw the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.830
 good player do not explain it very well 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.080
 but good click and the player will leave 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.100
 of the fired barrier let's go back 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.410
 to do it so you can see how it's done 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.739
 good to x on playstation3 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.989
 you see how the player is going to come out 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.060
 You see how he brings out his head a little bit 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.060
 the barrier and good and go for the ball 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.410
 good and finally let's explain what 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.690
 What else do people usually ask me? 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.970
 is how to move the barrier is worth for a 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.580
 side or the other we will choose the 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.150
 side we will put as a defending team 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.250
 and you see that pressing rt or r2 giving it 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.830
 small taps we are going to move 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.200
 to the right is good in this case 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.540
 upwards perez to the right 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.100
 by pressing rt or on playstation3 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.110
 r2 and well we can move also by 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.630
 suppository for the other side 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.700
 okay now let's see another 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.240
 example let's put back equipment 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.480
 defender and let's see how by pressing the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.610
 lt or l2 ok let's do 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.810
 the opposite action will go down or 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.030
 toward the left 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.040
 giving him small taps every time 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.830
 you give a tap give a little step towards 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.410
 aside here we will not take card 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.810
 yellow or given you can do without 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.110
 danger none would even tell you that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.720
 you can interact with the two vouchers 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.280
 hit each button 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.630
 a little bit up a little bit to 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.760
 down a little bit up a little bit 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.639
 low and good that way back a 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.810
 little which is going to throw it the lack 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.970
 that you will not see 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.389
 let's say where are you going to give the 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.200
 next step well, I think that 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.830
 that's all 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.990
 kids 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.680
 I hope I did not leave anything in the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.680
 inkwell and as always a greeting and goodbye
