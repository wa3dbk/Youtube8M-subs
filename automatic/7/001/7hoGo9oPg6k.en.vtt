they<00:00:18.390> were<00:00:18.480> boosting<00:00:19.199> but<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.740> were<00:00:19.800> uh<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
they were boosting but they were uh you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.390 
they were boosting but they were uh you
know<00:00:21.150> yeah<00:00:21.900> usually<00:00:22.230> when<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> people<00:00:23.279> are

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
know yeah usually when the people are

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.070 
know yeah usually when the people are
using<00:00:23.609> tax<00:00:23.970> I'm<00:00:24.150> used<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> thinking<00:00:24.539> booster

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
using tax I'm used to thinking booster

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.540 
using tax I'm used to thinking booster
but<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.800> them<00:00:25.949> use<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
but a lot of them use this just

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.920 
but a lot of them use this just
personally<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> know<00:00:27.359> where<00:00:27.510> their<00:00:27.599> spawning

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
personally to know where their spawning

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.570 
personally to know where their spawning
and<00:00:28.170> that's<00:00:28.349> actually<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.220> shabby

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and that's actually not too shabby

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.630 
and that's actually not too shabby
because<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> spawn<00:00:31.650> systems<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> free<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
because the spawn systems and free for

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
because the spawn systems and free for
all<00:00:32.730> were<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.870> flawed<00:00:34.140> than<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.500> now

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
all were more flawed than they are now

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
all were more flawed than they are now
and<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.100> still<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.760> extend<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> still

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and are still to extend we can still

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
and are still to extend we can still
spawn<00:00:37.110> right<00:00:37.380> next<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> somebody<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
spawn right next to somebody but it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
spawn right next to somebody but it
certainly<00:00:38.640> isn't<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.210> often<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> used<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
certainly isn't as often as it used to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.020 
certainly isn't as often as it used to
manage<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.430> week<00:00:41.850> or

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
manage and this like the first week or

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.330 
manage and this like the first week or
two<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.300> game<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.260> horrible<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
two this game it was horrible and I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
two this game it was horrible and I
refused<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> play<00:00:45.800> free-for-all<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.829> almost

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
refused to play free-for-all and almost

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.650 
refused to play free-for-all and almost
for<00:00:47.489> allowed<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.910> play<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> game<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.510> all

bowling<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.520> awesome<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.600> kind

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
bowling and that's awesome it was kind

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
bowling and that's awesome it was kind
of<00:01:42.840> an<00:01:42.960> idea<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.350> had<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:44.009> doing<00:01:44.250> soccer

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of an idea we had but I was doing soccer

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.870 
of an idea we had but I was doing soccer
and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.250> thinking<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and then all this but I'm thinking if I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510 
and then all this but I'm thinking if I
could<00:01:48.060> somehow<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.020> city<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.100> after

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
could somehow get a city of people after

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
could somehow get a city of people after
me<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:50.880> something<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
me or something like that and then I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
me or something like that and then I
don't<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> happen<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
don't know how it's going to happen but

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
don't know how it's going to happen but
I'm<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> try<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I'm going to try and see if you can

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
I'm going to try and see if you can
throw<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:56.759> into<00:01:57.180> other<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
throw people into other people and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.840 
throw people into other people and
knocking<00:01:58.649> down<00:01:58.680> because<00:01:59.130> half<00:01:59.430> would<00:01:59.820> be

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
knocking down because half would be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.220 
knocking down because half would be
awesome

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
awesome

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.990 
awesome
I<00:02:01.290> guess<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.160> depends<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.940> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I guess it all depends on that if you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
I guess it all depends on that if you
can<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> right<00:02:03.450> angle<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> actually

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
can get the right angle and actually

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.750 
can get the right angle and actually
knock<00:02:04.560> other<00:02:04.800> people<00:02:05.010> down<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.400> if<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
knock other people down so if that

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.070 
knock other people down so if that
happens<00:02:06.330> we're<00:02:06.510> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.780> having<00:02:06.930> some

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
happens we're going to be having some

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.370 
happens we're going to be having some
