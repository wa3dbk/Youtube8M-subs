00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.540
 Ved channel bon appetite and i'm alexei chicken 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.570
 cook a simple thing and ways it 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.120
 there is plenty to do, I suggest 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.580
 bake the mustard chicken which will add 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.850
 unusual taste and piquancy of tender 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.150
 chicken meat ingredients list like 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.990
 always in the description I start with garlic 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.130
 take 5-6 large cloves of garlic 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 cut in two pieces along 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.329
 and remove core finds on where from you 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.640
 ask 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.010
 I cut a clove and see a yellowish 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.290
 green sprout it is hard and besides 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.899
 chopped garlic from him quickly stronger 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.600
 but if the garlic is young nothing of 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.690
 you don't need to cut it out 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.030
 hens she already washed about sushi on and I 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.090
 cut off a little extra skin and a bit of fat 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.550
 watering it with lemon juice is needed here 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.860
 juice of one lemon or 5 tablespoons 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.460
 already squeezed juice which is sold in 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.420
 stores 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.680
 some juice needs to be left rubbing it in 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.130
 skin to be thoroughly soaked 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 fine the rest of the juice is pouring inside and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.130
 distribute 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.030
 now inside you need to put a bay 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.770
 leaf and thyme is bound and here in such 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.350
 a bouquet there I send all garlic 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.039
 together credos awesome scent of mine 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.990
 dish I take mustard in this case 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.140
 mixed three parts dijon and one 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.079
 slice a piece of grainy mustard generously 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.569
 whole chicken surface in total 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.770
 mustard will need 4 5 tablespoons 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.109
 you can not bother and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.509
 just use Dijon mustard and 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.700
 if you want a brighter piercing 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.700
 taste take spicy Russian mustard 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.780
 some salt and freshly ground pepper 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.780
 add them to your liking 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.060
 can you say on a fig but none the less 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.230
 take 200 milliliters of hot water 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 I throw there at the cube of chicken broth 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.360
 stir until dissolved 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.599
 now I shift the chicken shape to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.569
 which she will bake pouring all 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.120
 bouillon 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.470
 several pieces of butter 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.150
 place them here as well, everything is fine 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.769
 my oven is already warmed up to 210 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.690
 degrees put chicken there for half an hour 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:44.140
 half an hour later the hen was a little caked 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.610
 watering her broth now dropping 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.630
 oven temperature up to 185 degrees 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.030
 I put the chicken again, but for 1 hour already 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.410
 during this hour I take out the bird again and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.410
 I water it with broth 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.630
 if necessary, you can add water and 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.000
 so the chicken I baked in total 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.989
 difficulty for an hour and a half 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.989
 I put it on the serving plate 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.350
 bay leaf and thyme tidy up 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.780
 nafig get garlic here to throw it away 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.600
 not necessary though it all depends on your 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.600
 preferences distributing it by dish 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.470

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.780

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.680

 Finally, I can say that it is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.720
 really very good recipe 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.760

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.310
