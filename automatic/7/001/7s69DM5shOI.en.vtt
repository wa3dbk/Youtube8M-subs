00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 only one super 4 female remained 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.230
 or yes I remember well that they are called 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.530
 karen non loreley loreley that of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530
 first generation 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 well then in the last part there 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 we were left with a question who was there 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
 like best between rhythm and my rhythm 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.510
 answer is the bon ton 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'm sorry, so you refuse the public but 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 slightly more to the year I'm saying 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 that with it is produced but why 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 I would like to avoid comments like that below 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 to the player better than pokémon that me 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.770
 comments from children of 9 still arrive 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.750
 years they have just finished seeing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 TV viewing go to the computer 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 go to youtube find video opinions 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 and they write to me bakic vip 10 i pokémon fu 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:58.199
 assumes stronger since then to notice 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.780
 I started off well with the acrobat 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 cabbage I want to use a little that I do n't 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.689
 It looks like a new way by voting for 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.490
 the first time go by giving it that it is one 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.740
 female 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.420
 the first time a Spanish female e 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.369
 she is the only female of my son 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.369
 that is, I'm realizing now no type 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
 then departing they turn to sex 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.870
 let's pretend that madball is also a 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.030
 female ok however really sucks 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.659
 all male and all but one at a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.090
 both leg okay then my moves 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.580
 I'm the shitty moves I tell you right away 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 apart from earthquake what fury guarantee 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 I know it is the train is passing but it was 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.140
 the only pokémon that really was 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.280
 willing to use because don fame 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.800
 I always wanted to use I do not 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 never used nor competitive too 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.310
 quite decent at least for what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.500
 I remember myself in the fourth gene because 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 I stopped talking in the fourth gen 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.820
 I repeat, I'm always saying the same 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.190
 things in these last four parts 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.680
 go earthquake stub earthquake not stub 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.320
 just feel safe so I do first 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.929
 earthquake now I fuck you because you 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.380
 will skip the turn because you took care of yourself and 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.100
 so then down because I'm confused cause 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.209
 the same earthquake was good 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.950
 some vague the earthquake again 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.500
 cabbage affinity is faster right 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 giving both the data of rapid claws 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.730
 because it has a very poor speed 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.560
 like the difference is a paroxysm 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.750
 that I didn't close the transfer there 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.570
 main stream 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.570
 took ops I broke the fourth wall 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.070
 if you do n't know what it means I broke the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.230
 fourth wall look for it on google from a 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.680
 chrome will be level 51 try to beat 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.730
 but if it wishes but yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.600
 yes and of the blades the copper 70 55 can make you 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.800
 interning and tender but not because of me 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.260
 I remembered you had some moves 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.530
 useless instead no license to all moves 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.610
 good to a poison state move 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.239
 reverse that very good flight e 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.870
 trespolo sorry only to mention the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.730
 role of our steering wheel is more there 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.690
 safe because ball ideals, however, that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.690
 decreases the statistics 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.640
 vai plum 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.930
 the album Mr. euro and answers so yes 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.540
 leave me what you think when I love you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.299
 that's why we're playing myself 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.040
 I say is little and wait is possible or you 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.420
 chrome was emotional but it was still mine 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 turn I have a magic card in mind 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.129
 blanket precisely because I should say that 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.670
 kind of card is the one that is a lot 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.719
 covered if now somewhere in the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.329
 world a bar of the 90 will be swearing 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:49.159
 it's called quiet they are also played 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.450
 at a pro level on profits, in short, that 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.019
 let it be I was saying it in a manner 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.450
 enough fucking they said so 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.730
 still lacking eye play 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.470
 I think I do a bit of deeds missing a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.329
 little play I played that level 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.040
 professional I played with adults 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.150
 the comic books where I was I who is 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.709
 the ph showcase is called di risacca must 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.269
 take there were only adults I was the only one 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.269
 of 16 years 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.910
 so others were all at least 17 18 e 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.440
 then there is some adult also on the 25th 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.120
 30 years and never arrive before I did 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.830
 the maximum the top 8 then 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.160
 arrives with three first eight we were kind 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.170
 20 days at a professional level then 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.270
 unfortunately I stopped because I didn't want to 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.220
 we will sort because the video requires 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.590
 lots of money to be there according to chance 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.580
 we are more in the lists of maxi fi 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.460
 competitive 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.680
 maybe they talk about essential papers 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.210
 like the engines of March speak to you and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.830
 so that you find yourself caught up in liveri 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 make a bunch from scratch and it takes a 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.440
 a lot of money 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.720
 maybe then yes and even a freak 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.180
 that then I do everything done yes 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.500
 turns off even more maybe closed accounts 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.730
 just to make you understand that when I say 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.800
 that I played professionally 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.240
 help and I'm not saying bullshit 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.890
 the last tribute I played in the case 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.890
 someone wanted to ask was the 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.919
 the news ager you were politicians yes 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:17.300
 just as rich as mazzotti 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.739
 minutes car played in 2011 so yes 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.349
 but then after a stage in montale baduel 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:25.909
 bit and indeed I fell for it again 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.909
 because here they have banned stratos 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.000
 now you might think glargina 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.280
 because it does not become bold and batting 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.550
 competitive pokémon as you know it with 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.260
 yuki because it combines and there is yes 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.400
 they are already fanning as a child and so we say 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.940
 that my movement was built by 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.190
 only 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.280
 put the batting no I did it before 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.380
 when left to a boom 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.990
 let's change pokemon we put green thumb 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.790
 and let's go back to the pokémon because it's enough with 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:04.760
 scotti all means off topic 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:06.650
 I wanted to explain everything back then 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.610
 let's sit on the 95 stubs for 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.110
 get there or say hello to notice that i 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.940
 life begins to make like little ones 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.140
 47 did not go down 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.669
 you are cursed 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.470
 okay that right now down because not 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:26.980
 it will cure conspiracy special attack ever 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.980
 now sent down 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:39.580
 and bye bye perfect we defeated 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:41.110
 even karen you're good I like them 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.520
 coaches like you 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.590
 the other dog that makes the speech 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.090
 nicer pokémon strong weak pokémon 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.500
 they are distinctions dictated by selfishness 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.210
 coaches really smart 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.230
 should win to win with i 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.430
 their favorites 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.590
 i like your style you know what 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.150
 it really matters but the bell is waiting for you 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.520
 there is the best speech she does 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.730
 certainly however these super four 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.920
 they flew I would say we can 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.230
 quietly see in the next 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.760
 part where we will face the champion 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.490
 of the few world league but lenzi that 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.800
 I find that axo 24 I also said axo 24 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:16.900
 also said ex channel I also said 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.700
 as I said enough because I believe it is enough 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:23.880
 poor thing all between us 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:27.660
 then we care slightly who should 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.520
 be treated and we are ready 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.260
 we don't love but if we kind of water ourselves 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.900
 we have dragon type bags and so 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.280
 we have to get by ourselves and that's it 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.280
 this part all to the next
