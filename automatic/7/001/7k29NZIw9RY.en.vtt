00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.530
 Great Britain is for some things 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.350
 the world famous there would be for example the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.859
 British culture the famous British 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.869
 humor or the much praised British 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.519
 but also the queen and understatement 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.199
 Luxury limousines have the top class 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.820
 the united kingdom in the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 past has been a lot of world glory 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 a copy is the bentley 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 mulsanne and because that's such a nice one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.110
 Chauffeur limousine I let myself 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110
 ahead today 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 It rarely happens that a car tester 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 voluntarily in the second row place 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 We take an exception today 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.160
 or not 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.000
 matte drive please go very well 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000
 Mr. Kurth 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.509
 Bentley formerly the sister brand of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.580
 rolls royce belongs since the end of the 90s 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.130
 years to the volkswagen group the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.680
 There have been recent booklets since 2009 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.619
 it will drive about 26 tons 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 heavy limousine from a v8 biturbo 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.060
 gasoline engine with 377 kw 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.310
 usually the nicest place in the world 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.799
 Car, yes, always here, behind the front 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 Steering wheel but also the fund of garbage 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.000
 leaves hardly any wishes open where 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 otherwise you have on the standard 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.780
 rear seat electrically adjustable seats 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 or a massage function as standard 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.240
 that is very pleasant 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 By the way, there are also here on the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.970
 front sitting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 but that is not the only one 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.179
 good that good 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.280
 Adaptive cruise control costs extra and 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.710
 you are looking for a track holding assistant 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 but in vain does that offer in 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.490
 Europe standard digital radio best 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 sound quality, by the way, also for the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.880
 back places 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.140
 however, you can also use the cordless ones 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.140
 unpack headphones 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.459
 and here at the back 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.790
 his own entertainment program 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.520
 enjoy or get on the way too 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.420
 See optional screens where the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.160
 chauffeur drives 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.220
 so much luxury has naturally 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.580
 his price about 300,000 euros in 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.560
 Germany plus extras understands itself there 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 even the high consumption barely plays 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.060
 a role of 16,9 liters 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.300
 However, superplus is indicated in everyday life 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.680
 easily rises to over 20 liters too 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.020
 the automatic shutdown of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.900
 four-cylinders brings no big 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.850
 fuel savings is the garbage is almost 40 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.640
 centimeters longer than the long versions 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.270
 by bmw siebener or mercedes benz 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.550
 s class 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.920
 but he is conspicuous or pretentious 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.350
 that's why you do not have many chrome elements 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.010
 the British everything is consistent nothing 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.010
 exaggerated 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.540
 The doors have one 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.370
 automatic targeting in the interior 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.069
 our test car dominate 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.959
 piano lacquer songs and lots of chrome 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.130
 the seats are not only advised 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.130
 but also cool 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.900
 Did you want to take a seat here? 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.600
 actually do not even get up 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.600
 at most to switch to the fund 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.820
 because he sits here too luxurious 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.350
 If you need a lot of space you can do it from the back 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.980
 drive the passenger seat forward 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.440
 to let 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.760
 if you want to turn off something works 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.580
 noble tables from the front 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.620
 Lean back and we are protected from 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.480
 who wants to be a stranger can per 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.400
 press the button to darken the windows 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.580
 Of course, this also applies to 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.290
 the rear window if then more 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.480
 Passengers must be able to ride 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.680
 center console folded up and so on 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.510
 additional seat space to be created 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.430
 Who now thinks that was difficult 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.610
 perfect car for every opportunity is 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.170
 However, a hook has the drive 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.330
 with the man in German parking garages 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.850
 one comes thanks to the enormous length of 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.950
 scarcely five meters 60 not at all or only 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.690
 very hard 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.900
 That's why we try it today 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.820
 not just out but that's it 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.260
 also a show in front of limousine for 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.260
 people with the necessary change 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.310
 when you first come to bentley 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.740
 mulsanne takes place then you are already 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.840
 overwhelmed by the detail with the love 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.730
 this vehicle was made 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.290
 but if you are a bit longer in it 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.570
 On the way then you can see that 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.190
 not everything so perfect 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.580
 is like here in front 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.530
 this door seal would be me personally 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.140
 also expect perfection on this point 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.010
 in a 300,000 euro car but man 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.210
 must also still have air for 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:33.000
 Improvements have different looks there 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.030
 of course in advance here is easy for me 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.090
 I noticed nothing that I somehow 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.360
 complain had great sat comfortably 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.440
 all electrically adjustable air conditioning 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.790
 seat heating seat cooling front seat can 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.070
 I drive to the front when I have more 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.990
 want to have space 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.060
 so for the shocked is this 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.070
 car really great if you of course 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.900
 the necessary change has been enough for me 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.000
 it is not quite the high one 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.750
 purchase price and also the immense 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.750
 petrol cost
