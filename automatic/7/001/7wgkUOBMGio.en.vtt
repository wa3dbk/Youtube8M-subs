episode<00:01:35.880> 17<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:38.340> bit

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
episode 17 but it's a little bit

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
episode 17 but it's a little bit
different<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.329> based<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.960> 16<00:01:40.439> notes

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

different because it's based in 16 notes
but<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> principle<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
but the principle is the same so it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490

little exercise that most of you have
probably<00:02:16.409> already<00:02:16.860> learned<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:18.510> we're

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
probably already learned what we're

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.410 
probably already learned what we're
going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.349> we're<00:02:19.709> going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.950> play<00:02:20.420> one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
going to do is we're going to play one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.559 
going to do is we're going to play one
deal<00:02:21.659> on<00:02:21.989> every<00:02:22.829> partial<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.849> beat<00:02:24.329> of

deal on every partial of a beat of
sixteen<00:02:25.019> notes<00:02:25.170> okay<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.370> we're<00:02:26.489> going<00:02:26.579> to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
sixteen notes okay so we're going to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.789 
sixteen notes okay so we're going to
start<00:02:26.939> with<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> diddle<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.720> downbeat<00:02:28.110> then

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
start with a diddle on the downbeat then

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.740 
start with a diddle on the downbeat then
we're<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.159> shift<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.670> e<00:02:29.790> then

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
we're going to shift it to the e then

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.770 
we're going to shift it to the e then
the<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.099> up<00:02:32.340> right<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.269> it's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the and and then the up right and it's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.850 
the and and then the up right and it's
kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.079> little<00:02:34.170> progression<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.739> we're

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
kind of a little progression that we're

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.160 
kind of a little progression that we're
going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> go<00:02:35.159> through<00:02:35.599> when<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.720> first<00:02:36.959> learn

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
going to go through when you first learn

this first way that I teach you and then
I'll<00:02:40.829> give<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.129> couple<00:02:41.370> variations<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:42.269> to

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
I'll give you a couple variations to to

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.690 
I'll give you a couple variations to to
play<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:43.680> okay<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.159> let's<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.579> get

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
play as well okay so let's go and get

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
play as well okay so let's go and get
into<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.359> first<00:02:45.659> measure<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
into the first measure is just a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
into the first measure is just a
reference<00:02:47.459> measure<00:02:47.909> it's<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.269> measure<00:02:48.569> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
reference measure it's a measure of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.869 
reference measure it's a measure of
check<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:49.889> just<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.159> measure<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.489> straight

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
check so it's just a measure of straight

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.729 
check so it's just a measure of straight
sixteen<00:02:51.299> notes<00:02:51.450> played<00:02:52.109> with<00:02:52.290> alternating

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
sixteen notes played with alternating

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.550 
sixteen notes played with alternating
sticking<00:02:53.099> easy<00:02:53.970> enough<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.900> second<00:02:55.379> measure

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
sticking easy enough the second measure

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
sticking easy enough the second measure
is<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.799> first<00:02:56.129> measure<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.480> add<00:02:57.720> doodles

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
is a first measure that we add doodles

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.520 
is a first measure that we add doodles
on

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
on

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.399 
on
so<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.889> diddle<00:02:59.280> are<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.150> diddle<00:03:01.109> or<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
so the diddle are the diddle or the

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.530 
so the diddle are the diddle or the
double<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.579> second<00:03:02.849> measure<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.239> on

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
double of the second measure will be on

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.960 
double of the second measure will be on
the<00:03:03.900> downbeat<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> every<00:03:05.069> beat<00:03:05.250> okay<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.819> it'll

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the downbeat of every beat okay so it'll

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.129 
the downbeat of every beat okay so it'll
be<00:03:06.060> played<00:03:06.239> with<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.389> right<00:03:06.629> hand<00:03:06.930> it'll

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
be played with the right hand it'll

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:16.390 
be played with the right hand it'll
sound<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.409> this

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.640 

alright<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.579> measure<00:03:18.359> three<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:19.169> play<00:03:19.410> another

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
alright in measure three we play another

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.189 
alright in measure three we play another

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
measure of straight 16 notes in measure

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.619 
measure of straight 16 notes in measure
for<00:03:22.319> we<00:03:23.040> shift<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.519> diddle<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.120> one

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
for we shift that diddle back one

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.559 
for we shift that diddle back one
sixteenth<00:03:25.230> note<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.129> now<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:27.180> middle<00:03:27.419> is

so<00:03:30.810> measure<00:03:31.530> four<00:03:32.310> will<00:03:32.579> sound<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:32.790> this

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.080 

measure<00:03:42.870> five<00:03:43.230> another<00:03:44.160> measure<00:03:44.400> straight<00:03:44.730> 16

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
measure five another measure straight 16

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.150 
measure five another measure straight 16
notes<00:03:45.239> measures<00:03:46.049> six<00:03:46.349> we<00:03:46.530> shift<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.919> middle

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
notes measures six we shift the middle

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.939 
notes measures six we shift the middle
back<00:03:47.340> again<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.209> now<00:03:48.419> it's<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.260> end<00:03:49.440> of

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
back again so now it's on the end of

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.319 
back again so now it's on the end of
every<00:03:50.340> beat<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.699> it's<00:03:50.940> played<00:03:51.120> with<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
every beat and it's played with the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:02.470 
every beat and it's played with the
right<00:03:51.449> hand<00:03:51.949> that<00:03:52.949> will<00:03:53.010> sound<00:03:53.129> like<00:03:53.220> this

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.939 

measure<00:04:03.480> seven<00:04:03.930> another<00:04:04.409> measures<00:04:04.769> three

measure seven another measures three

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.710 
measure seven another measures three
sixteen<00:04:05.310> notes<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.609> measure<00:04:06.090> eight<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.569> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
sixteen notes and measure eight is the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.559 
sixteen notes and measure eight is the
last<00:04:06.989> measure<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.979> last<00:04:08.400> grouping<00:04:08.849> where<00:04:09.419> we

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
last measure the last grouping where we

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.270 
last measure the last grouping where we
shift<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> doodle<00:04:10.169> bat<00:04:10.319> one<00:04:10.650> more<00:04:10.859> sixteenth

shift the doodle bat one more sixteenth

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.399 
shift the doodle bat one more sixteenth
note<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.669> now<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.120> on<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.389> AH<00:04:12.510> at<00:04:13.019> every

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
note and now it is on the AH at every

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.020 
note and now it is on the AH at every
beat<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.829> played<00:04:14.069> with<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.280> left<00:04:14.459> hand<00:04:14.699> so

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
beat and played with the left hand so

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:24.410 
beat and played with the left hand so
that<00:04:15.239> will<00:04:15.449> sound<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.629> this

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.850

per minute if you want to jump in if not
don't<00:04:32.500> worry<00:04:32.680> about<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.160> learn<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.090> very

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
don't worry about it learn this very

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.540 
don't worry about it learn this very
very<00:04:34.660> slow<00:04:34.900> work<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.860> up<00:04:35.950> focus<00:04:36.370> on<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
very slow work it up focus on the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
very slow work it up focus on the
quality<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.030> an<00:04:37.180> interpretation<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.870> every

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
quality and an interpretation of every

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.200 
quality and an interpretation of every
single<00:04:38.680> table<00:04:38.920> that<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.220> play<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.670> then

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
single table that you play and then

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.230 
single table that you play and then
gradually<00:04:40.660> speed<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> up<00:04:41.080> over<00:04:41.290> time<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:43.060> here

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
gradually speed it up over time but here

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.760 
gradually speed it up over time but here
we<00:04:43.300> go<00:04:43.420> Stephanie<00:04:43.870> Guzman<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.320> few<00:04:44.440> minutes<00:04:44.680> up

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
we go Stephanie Guzman a few minutes up

00:04:44.770 --> 00:05:19.380 
we go Stephanie Guzman a few minutes up
emperial<00:05:17.280> all<00:05:18.280> right<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.940> there<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.180> that's

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
emperial all right so there it is that's

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.570 
emperial all right so there it is that's
the<00:05:19.510> exercise<00:05:19.930> now<00:05:20.470> like<00:05:20.920> I<00:05:21.010> said<00:05:21.220> there's<00:05:21.370> two

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
the exercise now like I said there's two

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.830 
the exercise now like I said there's two
other<00:05:21.730> variations<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.450> you<00:05:22.510> can<00:05:22.600> practice

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
other variations that you can practice

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.540 
other variations that you can practice
of<00:05:23.170> this<00:05:23.290> once<00:05:23.860> you<00:05:23.980> get<00:05:24.130> comfortable<00:05:24.430> with

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
of this once you get comfortable with

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.580 
of this once you get comfortable with
that<00:05:24.790> I<00:05:25.090> recommend<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.140> practice

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
that I recommend that you practice

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.280 
that I recommend that you practice
taking<00:05:27.400> all<00:05:27.760> those<00:05:28.060> measures<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.690> straight<00:05:28.900> 16

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
taking all those measures of straight 16

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.160 
taking all those measures of straight 16
notes<00:05:29.500> out<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.730> you<00:05:30.820> just<00:05:30.940> play<00:05:31.450> each<00:05:31.780> measure

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
notes out so you just play each measure

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.110 
notes out so you just play each measure
of<00:05:32.680> each<00:05:32.980> grouping<00:05:33.370> okay

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
of each grouping okay

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:54.739 
of each grouping okay
so<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.540> will<00:05:34.720> sound<00:05:34.840> like<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.790> one

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:54.749 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.649 

all<00:05:55.749> right<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:56.199> the<00:05:56.889> third<00:05:57.330> variation<00:05:58.330> that

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
all right and the third variation that

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.480 
all right and the third variation that
you<00:05:58.749> could<00:05:58.870> play<00:05:59.020> this<00:05:59.229> is<00:05:59.439> to<00:06:00.039> take<00:06:00.279> those

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
you could play this is to take those

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.510 
you could play this is to take those
groupings<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.270> plug<00:06:01.599> them<00:06:01.749> into<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.949> four<00:06:03.340> to

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
groupings and plug them into the four to

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.790 
groupings and plug them into the four to
one<00:06:03.729> formula<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.629> you<00:06:04.810> learned<00:06:05.050> in<00:06:05.319> episode

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
one formula that you learned in episode

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.739 
one formula that you learned in episode
18<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:06.699> if<00:06:06.789> you<00:06:06.879> don't<00:06:06.999> know<00:06:07.060> what<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.270> 41

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:07.749 
18 so if you don't know what the 41

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.159 
18 so if you don't know what the 41
formula<00:06:08.439> is<00:06:08.560> go<00:06:09.009> check<00:06:09.189> out<00:06:09.340> 18<00:06:09.779> episode<00:06:10.779> 18

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
formula is go check out 18 episode 18

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.320 
formula is go check out 18 episode 18
and<00:06:11.439> then<00:06:11.919> come<00:06:12.430> back<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.789> you<00:06:12.879> can<00:06:12.999> learn<00:06:13.120> how

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
and then come back and you can learn how

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.899 
and then come back and you can learn how
to<00:06:13.360> plug<00:06:14.050> these<00:06:14.590> groupings<00:06:15.279> into<00:06:15.729> that

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
to plug these groupings into that

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.490 
to plug these groupings into that
formula<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.389> it's<00:06:16.569> a<00:06:16.689> it's<00:06:16.990> a<00:06:17.050> pretty<00:06:17.199> fun

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
formula and it's a it's a pretty fun

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.950 
formula and it's a it's a pretty fun
exercise<00:06:17.949> to<00:06:18.099> play<00:06:18.279> so<00:06:19.000> work<00:06:19.599> out<00:06:19.750> that

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
exercise to play so work out that

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.959 
exercise to play so work out that
progression<00:06:20.319> learn<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.009> first<00:06:21.219> one<00:06:21.460> with<00:06:21.759> the

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
progression learn the first one with the

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.640 
progression learn the first one with the
measures<00:06:22.539> of<00:06:22.629> 16<00:06:22.930> notes<00:06:23.050> in<00:06:23.169> between<00:06:23.199> every

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
measures of 16 notes in between every

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.550 
measures of 16 notes in between every
grouping<00:06:23.979> then<00:06:24.610> play<00:06:24.939> the<00:06:25.870> once<00:06:26.199> you<00:06:26.289> get

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
grouping then play the once you get

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.339 
grouping then play the once you get
comfortable<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:27.270> practice<00:06:28.270> just<00:06:29.080> playing

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
comfortable that practice just playing

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:30.990 
comfortable that practice just playing
the<00:06:29.529> four<00:06:29.710> groupings<00:06:30.099> by<00:06:30.430> themselves

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
the four groupings by themselves
