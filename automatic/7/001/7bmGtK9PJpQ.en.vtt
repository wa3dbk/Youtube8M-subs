worms which we do in a way about what

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.410 
worms which we do in a way about what
really<00:01:42.200> sustains<00:01:42.740> them<00:01:43.070> did<00:01:43.850> they<00:01:43.880> eat<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
really sustains them did they eat the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
microorganisms that are breaking it down

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.529 
microorganisms that are breaking it down
ok<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.619> worms<00:01:48.830> get<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.190> good<00:01:49.430> deal<00:01:49.610> what

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
ok so the worms get a good deal what

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.649 
ok so the worms get a good deal what
about<00:01:50.750> us<00:01:51.670> what<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.880> really<00:01:53.030> gain<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.509> this

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
connection to a natural cycle you know
