00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.929
 Yes 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:15.440
 We opened a little bit of this blank on 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:24.660
 the numbers became softer of course still oak 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:26.720
 Tula on molding here we bring you later 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.430
 we than this workpiece in alcohol 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:36.950
 pharming to size form 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.950
 Here I am doing here sew 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 now we will do the markup going 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:53.969
 here in a circle on we make holes then you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.370
 we form and heal but before that we 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.780
 make a fixation and the minds of the word are shorter we 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.780
 came suspension 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.990
 suspension we will sew with this right 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.920
 the parties probably not even so much 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 Sew on how much 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.170
 let's try to keep this primitive mighty 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 so 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.560
 1 is not enough to be such a thing 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.450
 band 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.970
 so compound 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.150
 now we are all here this buono 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:15.550
 take and start shedding so we cut off 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.739
 anchorage names 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.670
 combined suspension we here we 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.670
 will not do. 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:44.790
 all more or less tidied up so now we wait 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:51.670
 size q more or less smith and sishov 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.959
 the thickness of the skin five punching somehow 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.410
 you better not really and where is mine 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.220
 I don't know the normal shell at home now 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.489
 after the bombing is called repair here 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.850
 I can not find a lot of things in this 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:17.709
 we will field what we have 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.739
 so crap this flat screwdriver with 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.750
 drank 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:28.620
 from here there are literally five meters 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.620
 put the first brand 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:41.860
 further more or less 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:45.090
 keeping access on doing such here we 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.090
 precise doors 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.970
 it turns out such 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.970
 symmetrical and step 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.710
 I have no reason for my wife 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.710
 girls are small 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.130
 so here we go further 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:33.659
 chew we mark in a circle and reached 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:39.240
 pin a loop just on here 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:49.169
 how much to eat in rome 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:53.159
 to this side we glue on 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:05:00.509
 store n-for four years 2 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:04.379
 from the outside 2 from the inside then with 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:12.409
 using such 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:12.409
 and beads of small pieces on the mucus of holes 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:23.300
 make a seam shape a little bit and sit 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.759
 sew what nylon thread 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:34.770
 big and smart 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:39.289
 that's not sticky braided so now i 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:43.289
 Finish partitioning paused then 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:47.310
 make a mark on the mount 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:54.529
 I will drill a couple of holes and we will go 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.529
 directly to the suspension mount 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.210
 blanks and what are the correct store 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.409
