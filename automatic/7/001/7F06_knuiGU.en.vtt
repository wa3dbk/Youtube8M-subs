LGBT community and I had hesitated on
gay<00:01:02.850> marriage<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:04.260> part<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.040> thought

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
gay marriage in part because I thought

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
gay marriage in part because I thought
civil<00:01:05.790> unions<00:01:06.150> would<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.420> sufficient<00:01:06.630> but

civil unions would be sufficient but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
civil unions would be sufficient but
that<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.979> something<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.729> give

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that was something that would give

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
that was something that would give
people<00:01:09.810> hospital<00:01:10.290> visitation<00:01:10.710> rights<00:01:11.159> and

people hospital visitation rights and
other<00:01:12.650> elements<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> take<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.400> granted

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
other elements that we take for granted

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
other elements that we take for granted
and<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:19.080> sensitive<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> fact<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.570> for

marriage was something that evokes very
powerful<00:01:27.810> traditions<00:01:28.290> religious<00:01:29.159> beliefs
