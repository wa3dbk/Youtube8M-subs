Blackburn in the FA Cup um what do you
know<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.799> blackburn<00:00:08.370> rovers<00:00:08.780> i<00:00:10.460> played

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
know about blackburn rovers i played

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.080

them<00:00:11.610> twice<00:00:11.880> last<00:00:12.450> year<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.049> i<00:00:14.780> think<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> team

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
them twice last year so i think the team

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.210 
them twice last year so i think the team
in<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:19.220> championships<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.520> always<00:00:20.789> dangerous

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
in the championships is always dangerous

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
in the championships is always dangerous
we<00:00:23.220> saw<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.789> good<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.480> brighton<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
we saw a good side of brighton in the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.859 
we saw a good side of brighton in the
last<00:00:25.470> round<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.449> counts

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
last round so we know what counts

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.919 
last round so we know what counts
especially<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> FA<00:00:29.730> Cup<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
especially in the in the FA Cup is it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.139 
especially in the in the FA Cup is it
harder<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.320> prepare<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.189> team<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> lower

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
harder to prepare for a team in a lower

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
harder to prepare for a team in a lower
division<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.290> maybe<00:00:34.469> as

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
division because you don't know maybe as

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.080 
division because you don't know maybe as
much<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:35.070> them<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.790> Premier

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
much about them as you do for Premier

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.430 
much about them as you do for Premier
League<00:00:36.210> teams<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.800> maybe<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.520> point

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
League teams yeah that's maybe one point

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
League teams yeah that's maybe one point
but<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.160> expectations<00:00:41.969> especially<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
but the expectations especially now in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.010 
but the expectations especially now in
the<00:00:43.469> FA<00:00:43.739> Cup<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.550> every<00:00:44.940> team<00:00:45.149> has<00:00:45.390> good

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the FA Cup are that every team has good

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
the FA Cup are that every team has good
quality<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> show<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> we

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
quality and but we want to show that we

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340 
quality and but we want to show that we
especially<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.770> home<00:00:50.480> can<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.199> difference

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
especially at home can be the difference

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.160 
especially at home can be the difference
and<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.610> Jordan<00:00:54.090> Rhodes<00:00:54.300> Blackburn<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.020> got

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and in Jordan Rhodes Blackburn have got

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
and in Jordan Rhodes Blackburn have got
one<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> informed<00:00:55.949> strikers<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.730> English

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
one of the informed strikers in English

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.490 
one of the informed strikers in English
football<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> minute<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.440> could

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
football at the minute you think could

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.070 
football at the minute you think could
be<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> handful<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> weekend<00:00:59.719> I<00:01:01.190> think

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
be a handful at the weekend I think

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.289 
be a handful at the weekend I think
especially<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
especially we we we have a we have a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
especially we we we have a we have a
strong<00:01:06.630> silent<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.439> shown<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
strong silent have shown that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.240 
strong silent have shown that
defensively<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.020> improved<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> last<00:01:10.350> few

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
defensively we improved in the last few

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
defensively we improved in the last few
games<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:13.549> which<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.939> should<00:01:15.000> cover<00:01:15.780> each

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
games so which we should cover each

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.120 
games so which we should cover each
other<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.630> their<00:01:18.630> strike<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.229> can't<00:01:19.650> get

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
other so that their strike us can't get

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.179 
other so that their strike us can't get
into<00:01:20.430> their<00:01:20.610> shape<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> best<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.979> see

tougher but in general I would say as a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.319 
tougher but in general I would say as a
team<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.860> defend<00:01:59.159> well<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
team we have to defend well that that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
team we have to defend well that that
makes<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.689> difference<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> end<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> FA

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
makes a difference in the end and the FA

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
makes a difference in the end and the FA
Cup<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> along<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> Champions<00:02:04.500> League

League<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:18.489> Premier<00:02:18.819> League<00:02:18.849> we<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.420> on

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
League and the Premier League we are on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.119 
League and the Premier League we are on
fifth<00:02:20.470> place<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.989> think<00:02:22.989> FA<00:02:23.470> cup<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> good

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
fifth place so I think FA cup is a good

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.619 
fifth place so I think FA cup is a good
chance<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:25.480> go<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.930> final<00:02:26.379> in<00:02:26.849> very<00:02:27.849> less

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
chance to go to the final in very less

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.130 
chance to go to the final in very less
games<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.769> yeah<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:30.760> need<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.090> focus<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.870> on

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
games so yeah we need to focus on on

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.560 
games so yeah we need to focus on on
that<00:02:32.349> situation
