00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 all barcelona stopped for the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.620
 neymar of the 50 thousand people have 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 welcomed to the camp the new phenomenon 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:24.060
 Brazilian arrived from the santos for 57 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:26.369
 million is a feeling 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.170
 incredible to be able to enter the camp nou 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.330
 to be applauded by the fans of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.170
 barcelona i had to hold back the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
 tears for joy 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 neymar has passed medical examinations of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.809
 routine and then signed a contract of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 five years with the blaugrana from the next 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.079
 year so another southern star 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.210
 America will add the samples of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.100
 spain even if the brazilian has only 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:59.550
 admiration for his next companion 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:02.039
 lionel messi is the best player of the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.870
 world and already here and put and I'm lucky 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.479
 because I will have the chance to play 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 with him it is a great honor for me I hope 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 to be able to help him continue to be 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 stronger than the world but with heaven at 62 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.590
 milan since he came to the fore 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 international in the last three years on 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.860
 neymar's name has been approached to all 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.680
 the big of europe as real madrid 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.150
 manchester united and chelsea but he 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.840
 reiterates that his choice was not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.799
 motivated by economic reasons so to speak 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 which acts in a large margin 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 look I didn't choose the team where 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.829
 they paid me more money is 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.930
 important but happiness still counts 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.270
 more is something that he taught me 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 my father asks me before a game 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 always if I'm happy if I answer no 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.649
 assures me by saying that everything will go for 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.649
 the best 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.479
 neymar then flew to brazil for 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.570
 to prepare for the confederations 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.570
 cup
