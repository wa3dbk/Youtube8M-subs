your flesh stick USB one gigabyte or
more<00:00:09.200> into<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> storage<00:00:11.040> unit<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> Xbox

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
memory unit so basically now we're going

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
memory unit so basically now we're going
to<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> computer<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
