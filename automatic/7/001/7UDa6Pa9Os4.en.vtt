00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.149
 they incorporate this system 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.489

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 and in the resolution of 329 by 240 pixels 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.370
 his battery by 100 more or less would offer a near autonomy to the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.590
 470 hours in standby mode keep in mind that these are parameters that do not 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
 says the manufacturer in optimal conditions of use of the network 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 its square shape hides a surprise and is 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 a full qwerty keyboard 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.830
 which also incorporates by a hundred the possibility of 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 simultaneo of the tactile operation of the device with 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 the introduction of text through this system that for many people because not

 stop being more comfortable 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 we have still done 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.340
 because the very new technology to touch screens in some people 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.310
 Well, we have here 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.420
 the action where we have on the one hand 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890
 The touch screen device that incorporates qwerty keyboard 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.180
 conventional 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 the device comes equipped with the crystaltalk technology that is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.390
 min baby motorola let's see an invesco argÃ¼ez 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 what to filter the noise of the environment for example if you find yourself in a bar you go to 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.830
 to be able to have a clear and clear conversation 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.979
 all of the rest of the issues are happening around you 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.610
 It also incorporates an interface 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.850
 the motor blur that is motor boiro 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 in this case it is a proprietary motorola technology 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.189
 an application better said who allows us 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.559
 by creating a user and password has your system 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:18.219
 link social networks that we have to which we have access faith and its 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.199
 written of prehistoric animals 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.749
 so at a stroke we can be connected to the three networks at the same time 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.399
 as you see on the screen percent is an android classic has 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.889
 multiscreen say to incorporate it judgment is that you need more 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:33.989
 often

 this neighbor country will organize part of the main screen 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.049
 we have three additional batches on each side 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.349
 in which we can go hanging because the google search browser loma 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.449
 pablo comas let's use 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.219
 at the same time we have so much through this path of the touch icon access to the menu 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.029
 main phone but we have all the applications and the 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.819
 general configuration 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.649
 the same as we have the thirteenth have three buttons under the screen 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:05.479
 Tactiles that allow us access to the menu 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.509
 access to the menu we wanted to enter through the tactile band of one's own 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.179
 motorola device 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.479
 with the most common operations that you come in the end a tone the viewer of 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.039
 office documents

 the phone official the social networks or measure 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.759
 this an android device 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.419
 is not that those who exploded sums this environment goes and know what little news 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.590
 no sense incorporates 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.290
 for now as we have indicated at the beginning most important is your screen 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.239
 touch and its qwerty keyboard 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.879
 that allows you to manipulate telephone in the two possible ways that there are in this 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.869
 moment 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:43.149
 nor in the lupus technology that incorporates allows hands-free and 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.159
 i opened stereo scarves 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.659
 on the back of the device we give his 3 megapixel camera 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.290
 in the area such better said on the right side the lip or for ap 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.649
 for vehicular 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.409
 the on / off button 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.689
 and in the lower part we find tel charger i for micro data cable 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.689
 bushehr 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.379
 behind its lid we can find a month for micro sd memory for 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.280
 expand the phone's memory and thus be able to stop the photos the mp3 and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.430
 all the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.269
 all the files that we need 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.520
 good left side as the typical volume control 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.960
 percent 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.370
 has to emphasize the knowledge of the central command that allows us 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.129
 browse the phone menu options 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.409
 so 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.699
 maxcom maxcom cpo to check 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.150
 if it is similar to the one that the teacher incorporated in four 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.270
 another state device of that motorola brand 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.680
 and allows us to process I will pay 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.910
 that's why more comfortable and we should not resort to tactical tactical antal 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.909
 In summary 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.219
 the most relevant thing about this device 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.210
 stay with this idea is your qwerty keyboard 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.460
 its touch screen is to say that simultaneous mololoa I have to enter to that 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.540
 nowadays they are available to all we know well expanded teka 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.070
 QWERTY 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.260
 for more convenience in mail and messaging detest 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.369
 and its touch screen is to say we do not give up any of the methods 

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:10.860
 entrance present today at the traffic lights 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.010
 once legal device 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.809
 it is easy to carry 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:20.369
 the weight the weight is very well very little has the purpose a weight of in all 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:22.669
 we integrate approximately 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.460
 of nothing else in the beginning will be left with this idea that the device 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.740
 motorola dynatac 1 tb in terminals strong and with android that in turn not 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.419
 give up the touch screen 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.750
