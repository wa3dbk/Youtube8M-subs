00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
played the game in the beginning they

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:03.910 
played the game in the beginning they
said<00:04:03.200> they<00:04:03.290> were<00:04:03.350> going<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.500> reset<00:04:03.800> the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
leaderboards so i did a lot of fucking

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.030 
leaderboards so i did a lot of fucking
around<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> beginning<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.720> game<00:04:09.040> when

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
around in the beginning of the game when

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.270 
around in the beginning of the game when
it<00:04:10.160> first<00:04:10.340> came<00:04:10.550> out<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.480> mean<00:04:12.350> it's<00:04:12.980> really

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
it first came out so I mean it's really

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.560 
it first came out so I mean it's really
hard<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.550> bring<00:04:13.670> your<00:04:13.760> kill<00:04:13.940> death<00:04:14.060> ratio<00:04:14.209> up

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
hard to bring your kill death ratio up

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.000 
hard to bring your kill death ratio up
when<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.810> got<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:14.959> lot<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.170> kills<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> lot<00:04:15.980> of

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
when you got a lot of kills and a lot of

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.259 
when you got a lot of kills and a lot of
dust<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:18.019> right<00:04:18.290> there<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.890> know<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.340> you

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
dust so that right there you know I you

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.510
