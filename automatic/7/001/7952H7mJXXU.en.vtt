picked up Valencia +1 on the handicap of
every<00:03:42.389> which<00:03:42.629> I<00:03:42.810> think<00:03:43.049> maybe<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> bit<00:03:44.099> of

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
every which I think maybe is a bit of

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.170 
every which I think maybe is a bit of
okay<00:03:44.519> interesting<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:45.090> yes<00:03:45.720> yeah<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.519> I<00:03:47.519> think

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
okay interesting one yes yeah I I think

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.430 
okay interesting one yes yeah I I think
you<00:03:48.540> remember<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> beginning<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.379> this

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you remember the beginning of this

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.619 
you remember the beginning of this
season<00:03:49.680> marina<00:03:50.310> was<00:03:50.430> all<00:03:50.609> in<00:03:50.760> defense<00:03:51.209> defense

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
season marina was all in defense defense

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.960 
season marina was all in defense defense
and<00:03:52.230> they<00:03:52.319> snakes<00:03:52.650> mixed<00:03:53.160> up<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> few<00:03:53.489> one<00:03:53.730> Mills

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
and they snakes mixed up a few one Mills

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.180 
and they snakes mixed up a few one Mills
turn<00:03:54.359> else<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.470> might<00:03:55.590> go<00:03:55.799> back<00:03:55.980> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
turn else I think you might go back to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.009 
turn else I think you might go back to
that<00:03:56.310> after<00:03:56.609> up<00:03:56.760> yeah<00:03:57.060> Tish<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.810> would<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:57.989> a

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
that after up yeah Tish it would be a

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.449 
that after up yeah Tish it would be a
very<00:03:58.139> interesting<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.889> see<00:03:59.069> which<00:03:59.220> way<00:03:59.430> it

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
very interesting to see which way it

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.039 
very interesting to see which way it
goes<00:03:59.609> with<00:03:59.940> Mourinho<00:04:00.269> cuz<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.599> genuine

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
goes with Mourinho cuz this genuine

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.839
