00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.000 
otherwise it will get steep or it will
get<00:02:27.760> born<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> corner<00:02:28.840> okay<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> sticking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
get born in the corner okay so sticking

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.260 
get born in the corner okay so sticking
to<00:02:36.370> her<00:02:36.510> yeah<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:39.459> sticks<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> spatula

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
to her yeah that sticks to the spatula

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.420 
to her yeah that sticks to the spatula
and<00:02:40.720> then<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.410> get<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> really<00:02:41.890> thick<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.340> have

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
and then you get a really thick you have

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.920 
and then you get a really thick you have
to<00:02:42.550> make<00:02:42.700> sure<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> lot<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.750> gone

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
to make sure that a lot of it is gone

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.500 
to make sure that a lot of it is gone
right<00:02:44.140> don't<00:02:47.280> push<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.400> put<00:02:48.610> double<00:02:48.970> cast<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
right don't push I put double cast and a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.870 
right don't push I put double cast and a

AmeriCorps chili powder some believe
their<00:03:13.150> chili<00:03:13.420> powder<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:15.069> since<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:17.290> don't

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
their chili powder but since we don't

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:30.600 
their chili powder but since we don't
put<00:03:17.920> any<00:03:18.130> spice<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:20.190> better

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.840 

yes<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.880> gets<00:03:32.120> thicker<00:03:32.720> i<00:03:33.190> will<00:03:34.190> make<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.490> taste

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
yes it gets thicker i will make a taste

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.960 
yes it gets thicker i will make a taste
of<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:36.320> will<00:03:36.440> spread<00:03:36.770> little<00:03:37.220> bit<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
of this it will spread little bit on the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.720 
of this it will spread little bit on the
counter<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.350> leave<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.550> few

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
counter like this and leave it for a few

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.210 
counter like this and leave it for a few
seconds<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.540> then<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.500> keep<00:03:42.680> stirring<00:03:43.100> the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
seconds and then you keep stirring the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.130 
seconds and then you keep stirring the
whole<00:03:43.370> time<00:03:43.580> oh<00:03:43.790> yeah<00:03:43.940> very<00:03:44.120> very<00:03:44.420> edges<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.110> it

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
whole time oh yeah very very edges to it

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.220 
whole time oh yeah very very edges to it
otherwise<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.280> will<00:03:46.430> get<00:03:46.640> steep<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.330> little

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
otherwise it will get steep a little

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.950 
otherwise it will get steep a little
burn<00:03:48.560> right<00:03:48.920> little<00:03:49.250> barn<00:03:49.460> and<00:03:49.850> from<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
burn right little barn and from the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.290 
burn right little barn and from the
topic<00:03:51.410> let<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.740> dry<00:03:52.010> too<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:54.140> long<00:03:54.590> just<00:03:55.370> with

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
topic let it dry too so long just with

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.930 
topic let it dry too so long just with
your<00:03:56.480> finger<00:03:56.900> roll<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.710> is<00:03:57.860> not<00:03:58.070> still<00:03:58.550> we

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
testing it until the lift from the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.490 
testing it until the lift from the
counter<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.450> start<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.840> roll<00:04:06.020> on<00:04:06.200> its<00:04:06.350> own

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
counter and start to roll on its own

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:22.850 
counter and start to roll on its own
right<00:04:06.980> okay

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860
