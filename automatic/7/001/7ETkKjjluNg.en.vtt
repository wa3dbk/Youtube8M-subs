 active because more active because you watch 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 images can already frame two 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 ladies who will not come to the match in 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.030
 lucania or better in campania when the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.430
 Lucanian team, however, hear them 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.350
 they feel it so much that they are preparing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.469

 you are cooking 700 meatballs we had 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.390
 said and 500 but we did 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 even more so as we know that we know that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 French camp have enough we say 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 500 hunger could even not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 enough and we always do things 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 to drive not to stay for 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 the people who will be hurt 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 few 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 how did this idea of the gods come about? 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.329
 meatballs then bring them ideas 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 come since give it when times 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.229
 he played he was a little bundle because 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 he does not eat so many things he brought her 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.200
 meatballs so they tasted mine 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.119
 meatballs and then wanted to make them into 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.229
 other trips we made in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:58.979
 previously and now we did 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:01.350
 this is the idea of ​​meatballs 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.149
 let's say for the whole bus 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 but what these poles have particularly particular 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.929
 not at all they have nothing but the thing 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.520
 that we say we bring something home 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.170
 I wish I heard John speak 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.799
 my mom's meatballs said 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.249
 good 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:22.150
 I am not one that others are 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:24.459
 to judge I cannot say are good 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.870
 we are not good we have an important one 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.879
 helping hand 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.819
 the lady rosetta is not and if the help of 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.219
 my aunt was spontaneous and came 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.590
 with all my heart, how long 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.930
 to cook these these meatballs is a 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.189
 a long time 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
 how long has he been working since 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.560
 this morning we are almost there 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.659
 finished we can show them a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.060
 little for the meatballs that are here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:56.409
 and we can of course find out no 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:58.989
 you will already see how there are 12 onion 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.290
 we have cheese and no cheese 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.389
 all satisfied by the way we talked 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.980
 of meatballs regardless of 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.469
 story that the lady told us 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.219
 josie the fact that it could be too 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:15.639
 a symbol of the Ligino symbol of the 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:18.280
 meatballs we said better to eat them and 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.599
 do not take them in this case I just 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.209
 I want to say because we do 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.189
 these meatballs because they bring us good 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.079
 because two years ago we went to 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.829
 night play of drills and here we are 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.019
 brought meatballs and succeeded because 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.030
 we went to excellence with 90 a 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.120
 bring these meatballs boccadasse that to 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.209
 we also go in series d is one thing 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 for this we continue to make meatballs 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.340
 which among other things we can say the menu 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.169
 the torcida giallorossa as well as 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.060
 we called it not only based 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:53.949
 of meatballs because we have to be 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.180
 here it is the most complete was not enough 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.969
 simple foxes are not enough simple 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.859
 meatballs but sometimes what they will eat 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.319
 fans during this journey 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.550
 then sandwiches will also be eaten 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:10.000
 and then there's a bit of 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.510
 of beer to drink a little bit to a little yes 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.520
 a bit of coca cola gazzosa beer too 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.730
 a bit of wine a little bit was a bit of 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.530
 joy always within the limits always everything 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.990
 made limits because we are gods 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.940
 sportsmen far from for the fans why 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.790
 after we go we go there with 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.910
 children with the wife also the people who 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.650
 he's 80 years old and we're going to get one 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.410
 trip we say because we are now 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.050
 satisfied where we arrived or 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.300
 we lose or win for us is the same 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.490
 because now we are passing 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.690
 messina and even passing for us we are 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.790
 satisfied 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.880
 a complete menu because it also speaks 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.590
 of eggs 120 eggs are wrong there are 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.140
 120 well fried eggs but made the tough 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.400
 hard so here we come back to 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.580
 talk to the lady for a moment 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.280
 maurizio follow me with the camera 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:09.040
 there was also talk of olive olives with garlic 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:14.110
 the boys used to tell me , not here 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.890
 here came one of the well arrived 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.810
 firmer fans warmer then 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.690
 menu we said sui generis though 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.930
 absolutely respectable but I think 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:30.010
 yes, but let's hope that 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.290
 day is good and we will have fun 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.960
 certainly thanks also to these 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.020
 ladies who are preparing this for us 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.940
 menu cheerfulness will also be useless 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.060
 hide it from wine and beer 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.040
 your pa de ceva is a little wine a little 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.620
 of beer but I am a bit of wine stop or 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.090
 beer that means we quantify 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.790
 will be a 10 liters of wine and some 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.130
 there is no more beer box 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.230
 some laughter someone would like to say 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.240
 that if a pinocchio in this no is not 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.830
 true is not true this is the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.540
 fridge that speaks this here 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.480
 we have to fill this refrigerator here 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.910
 You are welcome 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.310
 let's see Mauritian approaching us 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.520
 let's look at the refrigerator from a bit 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.520
 to fill 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.430
 so just only this fridge then 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.390
 we can stay at dinner was another for 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.580
 the perfect then pays the last 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:33.680
 what we talked to with your father about 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.490
 symbol of tonino bonino meatballs 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.470
 turin 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.630
 the last entry the last only one thing 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.060
 donnino one thing only 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.730
 what then were we talking about the gods 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.500
 meatballs as a Mauritian symbol we spoke 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.990
 meatballs as a symbol for meatballs 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.000
 eat better and do not take them lia 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.370
 it's right so it's better to eat them than 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.470
 take them and then form a symbol that 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.580
 the lady even did it when 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.070
 we won the cup is therefore made 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.240
 even the meatballs they bring well says 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.240
 do not wear meatballs well
