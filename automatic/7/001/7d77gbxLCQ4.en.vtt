00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 and this thing should be aica 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 minecraft roads the demons are piece 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.060
 and today I am here in a mod as I had 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 already announced very particular is not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.070
 just the mode because it should not be installed 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.470
 like minecraft maina mode we say 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.660
 dedicated to minecraft is really a point 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 ex as if it were an alternative game a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.790
 minecraft that has a story is similar to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 that of minecraft and therefore based 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.739
 on the minecraft style of play is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.600
 just dedicated to minecraft ok blade of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.270
 question to the slime fashion mania and is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.730
 very nice look we have here different 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.539
 rooms now there is the game tutorial 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 or mini game 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.969
 now I show the game look and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 like a super mario a browser game 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.730
 similar to those of supermario the keys 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.620
 they are the usual ones of the usual viz. vs di v 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.640
 to jump and what to do 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.260
 we must overcome all my levels 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 let's say yes a transposition of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.229
 super mario is a super mario style 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 minecraft the fact with many adventures e 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.470
 various menate 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 I must say that it is very nice I have it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.950
 tried also for a short time and I must say 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.110
 which I enjoyed because 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.789
 says something quite funny 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 being able to see your game 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.229
 favorite in minecraft is also done 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 we say the graphic is not that of 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.640
 the best is a maio we say enough 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.380
 retrogame however there is for the mechanics of 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240
 game and for what it needs done 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.649
 really good 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.569
 there are several mini games so there 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.450
 you can have fun soon 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.920
 they will also introduce the department 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.649
 multiplayer is not a lot of fashion 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.140
 known because it was recently 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.030
 made and very few people know it 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.069
 but I must say that one of the best that 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.720
 be it because at different types of levels 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.610
 oplà all based on the skill here is it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 quite difficult however the slime 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.799
 let's say it's life while that 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.459
 should have seen what it should 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.739
 look like a coin 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 according to me it is a moment that of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.310
 fire that I do not get the name but not 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 I think so, I think it's done 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.799
 purpose right where I'll succeed 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
 will do is very nice so I recommend if 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.900
 someone wants somebody there 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.970
 They can enjoy games of this type 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.269
 maybe to review us because the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.430
 game itself is long enough 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.700
 after you do now I'll show you too 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.769
 how it works there are several rooms that 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.739
 should beat pretty much all for 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.079
 be able to get to the final boss like 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.389
 see we have the lives and side by side 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.329
 Coin coins represent our 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.859
 score while lives represent 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.079
 the lives now I'll show you when 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.180
 we lose all lives while looking for a 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.500
 moment to go on always becomes 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 but the most difficult hand as you have 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.760
 just seen now I kill myself to do 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.530
 see what happens at the end of the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.870
 screw there will be the word game over you 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 die of everest art now and you will have to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.880
 start all there are different levels 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 as you can see there are several rooms in it 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.849
 they are adding more and more you see 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.950
 the bosses 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.739
 we have the bosses that we will have to face 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.410
 we say in the beginning in a normal way 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.880
 are the keys the baskets you see is really 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.549
 well done this way i like it 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.110
 very much also because the simple fashion 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.390
 it is not 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.920
 complicated as all the others though 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.720
 can entertain 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.010
 I must say that it is also simple because 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.090
 we can jump from one level to another 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.500
 when we fail through 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.150
 normal mind we enter let's do the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.670
 exchange and we can enter any 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.420
 another level and very beautiful because not 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.180
 they want us 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.910
 it doesn't take a good reda turned can 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.130
 play anyone when he has time we say 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.450
 that even levels are saved here they are 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.459
 also adding a check point 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.160
 automatic let's say when you enter 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.410
 record automatically because now 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.880
 that is, it does not automatically register it 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.980
 you will have to enter each time when 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.950
 entered your name and the second one 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.739
 me the flaw are the first in Italy or is 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.770
 also one of the few in the world that 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 reviews it perceives why it comes from me 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.760
 tell the cc cc that this fashion as you see 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.160
 the first boss 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.370
 I wouldn't even know how to deal with it 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.780
 since I do not play so much that is not there 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.620
 I've never played brent is the first time 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.290
 that the pro 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.030
 here are some you see we need 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.240
 keys to logically open them not 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.410
 glasses because not yet and you see that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.940
 it's pretty hard we have 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.770
 need bombs but i don't know how 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.740
 it works because I haven't played it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.710
 practically nothing you see here is here with 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.560
 air we open the menu the menu with written 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.510
 to buy life 55 hearts cost us 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.100
 lives to buy bombs than right now 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.500
 however we do not need and need 20 20 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.340
 20 coin the lives diets really cost 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.840
 much 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.300
 we still live was and we can go out 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.870
 clicking q we select the bombs and then 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.570
 clicking here now if I can not 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.040
 I do nothing, I ca n't do it 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.020
 show us how many bombs 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.790
 let's use them if you can 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.650
 maybe that's because I can't do it is 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.690
 too good and better than me not 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.610
 I can beat it anyway guys it is 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.919
 really nice that way I recommend it to 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.430
 all there are these little visual bugs 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.340
 which really matters little see how the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.380
 the horizontal trail that you don't 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.120
 they overlap very well 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.400
 see they can't stay that way 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.380
 logically there are visual bugs though 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.630
 the mode and as we still say in phase 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.720
 of evolution that I love so it really is 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.980
 beautiful as now the bosses are many 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.980
 I'll show you another one now 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.190
 right at the final levels but no I have to 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.770
 we have to be so good we have 16 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.240
 let's not here we have the sixteen 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.000
 that the boss and then we have all the others 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.590
 rom see here the 15 are therefore 16 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.840
 levels in all so well they are not 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.340
 few and I must say that they are not few 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.010
 because they are also quite long 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.780
 i think the gameplay time is gameplay 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.570
 2 about an hour 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.210
 well for a game developed under the idea 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.130
 of minecraft has been done really well 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.140
 I must say anyway compliments i 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.240
 I advise creators is a lot 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.510
 this mode for minecraft lovers 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.610
 but especially for super lovers 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.860
 sea ​​because it is made really well and is 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.260
 just unlock them ie for all 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.240
 levels we will need what is there 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.620
 so in the previous level it is done 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.140
 I really recommend it to everyone 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.700
 so guys I remind you to put 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.140
 I like to subscribe to the channel for

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.920
 be able to see you in the near 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.910
 video on minecraft by mode 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.910
 hello everyone guys
