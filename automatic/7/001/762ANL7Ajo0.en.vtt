00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the characters on plane generations and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.789 
the characters on plane generations and
from<00:03:33.540> what<00:03:33.690> i<00:03:33.750> heard<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.139> generations<00:03:34.709> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
from what i heard for generations the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039 
from what i heard for generations the
reason<00:03:35.250> why<00:03:35.400> supports<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.569> support<00:03:36.930> only

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
reason why supports the support only

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.140 
reason why supports the support only
characters<00:03:37.560> are<00:03:37.650> only<00:03:37.769> supports<00:03:38.310> was<00:03:38.849> because

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
characters are only supports was because

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.970 
characters are only supports was because
they<00:03:39.299> did<00:03:39.419> not<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.870> enough<00:03:40.349> time<00:03:40.680> to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
they did not have enough time to

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.819 
they did not have enough time to
transfer<00:03:41.400> them<00:03:41.549> into<00:03:41.579> playable<00:03:42.180> characters

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
transfer them into playable characters

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.229 
transfer them into playable characters
because<00:03:43.829> by<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.549> time<00:03:44.639> they<00:03:44.970> had<00:03:45.060> talked

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
because by the time they had talked

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.150 
because by the time they had talked
about<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.569> supports<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.319> know<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.889> was
