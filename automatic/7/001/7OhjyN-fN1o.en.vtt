00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
probably next to the x-wing it's a quite

probably next to the x-wing it's a quite
impressive<00:00:23.760> vehicle<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.890> all

Wars<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.720> Legacy<00:00:31.380> Collection<00:00:33.440> hopefully

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
Wars like Legacy Collection hopefully

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.970 
Wars like Legacy Collection hopefully
your<00:00:34.590> rights<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:36.200> don't<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> box<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
your rights I don't have the box for it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.510 
your rights I don't have the box for it
anymore<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> hopefully<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:40.050> but

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
anymore so I hopefully that's right but

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.740 
anymore so I hopefully that's right but
it's<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> version<00:00:42.000> where<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.480> there's

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it's the version where it's and there's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's the version where it's and there's
no<00:00:42.870> battle<00:00:43.140> damage<00:00:43.590> will<00:00:43.770> no<00:00:43.860> web<00:00:44.100> ring<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
no battle damage will no web ring on it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.990 
no battle damage will no web ring on it
so<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.629> died<00:00:45.989> clean<00:00:47.000> pretty

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so it's pretty much died clean pretty

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.470 
so it's pretty much died clean pretty

here you can see here you can either
have<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.670> let's<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:13.010> or<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:16.040> we're

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have them in let's say or out and we're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.410 
have them in let's say or out and we're
out<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:18.770> inside<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> r2<00:01:21.000> unit

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
out and inside here you have a r2 unit

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
out and inside here you have a r2 unit
as<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.670> by<00:01:23.850> CB<00:01:24.210> just

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
as you can see here it's by CB just

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.910 
as you can see here it's by CB just
ahead<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.439> moves<00:01:26.189> around<00:01:26.310> 360<00:01:26.939> degrees

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
ahead of it so moves around 360 degrees

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.109 
ahead of it so moves around 360 degrees
ISO<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.930> also<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.229> opening<00:01:31.619> canopy<00:01:32.189> top

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
ISO and also have an opening canopy top

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.109 
ISO and also have an opening canopy top
so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.930> place<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.850> finger<00:01:35.850> inside<00:01:38.119> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so you can place the finger inside like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.429 
so you can place the finger inside like
say

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
say

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.880 
say
um<00:01:41.630> also<00:01:43.850> has<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.359> button<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:46.560> with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
um also has a button at the back with

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
um also has a button at the back with
this<00:01:47.159> engine<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:49.109> you<00:01:49.259> push<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.679> like

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
this engine is and if you push it like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.469 
this engine is and if you push it like
so<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.649> wings<00:01:52.829> pop<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:56.359> you<00:01:57.359> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
so the wings pop out like so you can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.419 
so the wings pop out like so you can
also<00:01:58.280> extend<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.609> wings<00:01:59.819> out<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:01.429> pulling

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
also extend the wings out by pulling

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.389 
also extend the wings out by pulling
them<00:02:02.869> what<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:06.179> then<00:02:06.390> inside<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.869> have

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
them what so and then inside you have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.110 
them what so and then inside you have
rocket<00:02:08.399> base<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.229> both<00:02:10.739> sides

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
rocket base you can see here both sides

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.789 
rocket base you can see here both sides
and<00:02:12.120> also<00:02:12.440> has<00:02:13.970> projectiles<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.239> shoots<00:02:15.450> out

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
and also has projectiles it shoots out

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.009 
and also has projectiles it shoots out
and<00:02:16.799> got<00:02:17.040> button<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.629> button<00:02:18.900> on

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
and got button there and a button on

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.210 
and got button there and a button on
this<00:02:19.200> side<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.400> press<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.410> they<00:02:22.890> fire

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
this side you just press and they fire

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.619 
this side you just press and they fire
off<00:02:23.489> right<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:26.959> I'd<00:02:27.959> say<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.129> I'd<00:02:30.030> say<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.569> is

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
off right so I'd say so I'd say this is

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.920 
off right so I'd say so I'd say this is
quite<00:02:30.959> an<00:02:31.200> impressive<00:02:31.410> vehicle<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.099> one<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
quite an impressive vehicle this one and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
quite an impressive vehicle this one and
it's<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> bit<00:02:34.079> hard<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.410> display<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.640> that's<00:02:35.819> why

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's a bit hard to display so that's why

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.140 
it's a bit hard to display so that's why
I<00:02:36.030> picked<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.290> steam<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:38.370> with<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.640> plastic

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
I picked up the steam get with a plastic

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.890 
I picked up the steam get with a plastic
model<00:02:39.420> kit<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.220> I've<00:02:41.220> used<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.660> can

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
model kit and I've used it so I can
