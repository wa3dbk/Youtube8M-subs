view number two I replace or remove the
the<00:00:04.710> manifold<00:00:05.839> the<00:00:06.839> manifold<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.830> then<00:00:08.099> I'm

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
the manifold the manifold and then I'm

the manifold the manifold and then I'm
looking<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.849> making<00:00:09.300> sure<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.050> gasket

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
looking at making sure that the gasket

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.580 
looking at making sure that the gasket
is<00:00:11.280> good<00:00:11.519> since<00:00:12.389> I'm<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.719> if<00:00:13.049> these<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.349> like

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
is good since I'm out if these are like

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.880 
is good since I'm out if these are like
only<00:00:13.920> six<00:00:14.670> eight<00:00:14.849> dollars<00:00:15.560> these<00:00:16.560> little

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
only six eight dollars these little

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.849 
only six eight dollars these little
gaskets<00:00:17.390> just<00:00:18.390> replace<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.470> know<00:00:19.590> might

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
gaskets just replace them you know might

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
gaskets just replace them you know might
as<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:21.180> believe<00:00:22.100> these<00:00:23.269> gaskets<00:00:24.269> should

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
as well I believe these gaskets should

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.859 
as well I believe these gaskets should
be<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.470> six<00:00:25.800> dollars<00:00:25.949> five<00:00:26.310> dollars<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
be about six dollars five dollars to

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.429 
be about six dollars five dollars to
again<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.580> worth<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.510> five<00:00:30.750> six

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
again you it's it's worth the five six

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
again you it's it's worth the five six
dollars<00:00:31.769> ten<00:00:32.130> dollar<00:00:32.309> investment<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.540> each

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
dollars ten dollar investment for each

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
dollars ten dollar investment for each
new<00:00:34.590> gasket<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.790> won't<00:00:36.170> he<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.410> did<00:00:37.590> safety

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
new gasket it won't he just did safety

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.229 
new gasket it won't he just did safety
now<00:00:39.170> what<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> did<00:00:40.680> notice<00:00:40.950> when<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
now what I did notice when I did the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.900 
now what I did notice when I did the
video<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> decided<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
video that I decided I was going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.100 
video that I decided I was going to
replace<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.280> because<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.460> cracked<00:00:48.110> cracked

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
replace it because it's cracked cracked

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
replace it because it's cracked cracked
in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.430> cracked<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> front

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
in the back it's cracked in the front

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.150 
in the back it's cracked in the front
and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.739> wasn't<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.370> able<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> fix<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
and I wasn't gonna be able to fix it on

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
and I wasn't gonna be able to fix it on
however<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.350> think<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
however now that I have it off I think I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.740 
however now that I have it off I think I
might<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.710> able<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> fix<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.750> now<00:01:00.750> that's

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
might be able to fix it now that's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
might be able to fix it now that's
something<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.890> person<00:01:04.920> has<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> make

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
something that one person has to make

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.500 
something that one person has to make
the<00:01:05.820> decision<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> other<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
the decision on now the other thing is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.719 
the decision on now the other thing is
this<00:01:09.510> gasket<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.770> manifold<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.580> are

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this gasket this manifold these are

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
this gasket this manifold these are
solid<00:01:12.710> they<00:01:13.710> shouldn't<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.460> cracked<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
solid they shouldn't have cracked and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
solid they shouldn't have cracked and
that<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.159> mean<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.610> many<00:01:17.939> things<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that one I mean there's many things that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
that one I mean there's many things that
could<00:01:18.540> happen<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.110> could<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.890> caused

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
could happen because could have caused

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.370 
could happen because could have caused
it<00:01:22.159> one<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> engine<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.170> hot

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it one you know the engine was hot

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
it one you know the engine was hot
somebody<00:01:25.920> pressure<00:01:26.670> washed<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.390> cold

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
somebody pressure washed it with cold

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
somebody pressure washed it with cold
water<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.619> cracked<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
water could have cracked it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330 
water could have cracked it
that's<00:01:29.880> gonna<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.329> hard<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that's gonna be hard to see now one

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
that's gonna be hard to see now one
thing<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.119> notice<00:01:33.350> when<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.590> doing<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
thing I did notice when I was doing this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.840 
thing I did notice when I was doing this
is<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.420> supposed<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.020> moving

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
is this is not supposed to be moving

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.289 
is this is not supposed to be moving
okay<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.579> wiggle

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
okay so over time this little wiggle

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
okay so over time this little wiggle
will<00:01:42.840> put<00:01:43.079> pressure<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.100> pressure<00:01:44.280> was

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
will put pressure and the pressure was

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
will put pressure and the pressure was
right<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.600> crack<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
right here was the crack right here so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.560 
right here was the crack right here so
that<00:01:47.450> crack<00:01:48.530> could<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.740> been<00:01:49.890> caused<00:01:50.130> by

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that crack could have been caused by

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350 
that crack could have been caused by
over<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.320> last<00:01:52.530> few<00:01:52.799> years<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.729> bending<00:01:54.240> up

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
over the last few years this bending up

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
over the last few years this bending up
and<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.659> bending<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.500> putting

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and down bending up and down putting

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.830 
and down bending up and down putting
enough<00:01:56.579> pressure<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.270> found<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.659> weak<00:01:57.810> spot

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
enough pressure and found a weak spot

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.300 
enough pressure and found a weak spot
and<00:01:58.290> cracked<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.700> what's<00:02:00.329> causing<00:02:00.540> this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and cracked it now what's causing this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.429 
and cracked it now what's causing this
well<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.659> down<00:02:03.810> there

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
well if you look down there

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.810 
well if you look down there
and<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.579> thing<00:02:05.670> right

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and you see that little thing right

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
and you see that little thing right
there<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.110> supposed<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.560> screwed

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there that is supposed to be screwed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.040 
there that is supposed to be screwed
into<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> frame<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.970> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
into the frame it's not so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530 
into the frame it's not so
I'm<00:02:13.500> missing<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.130> screw<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.000> I'll<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I'm missing a screw so I'll have to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.960 
I'm missing a screw so I'll have to
finally<00:02:15.840> screw<00:02:16.080> once<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.380> fix<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.670> repair

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
finally screw once I fix this and repair

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.060 
finally screw once I fix this and repair
this<00:02:19.850> find<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> screw<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.590> make<00:02:22.590> sure<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
this find a screw to make sure that this

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.410
