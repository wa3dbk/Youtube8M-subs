00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
originally tried to open this and was

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.840 
originally tried to open this and was
not<00:01:08.880> able<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:10.409> basing<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> fact

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
not able to I was basing it on the fact

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
not able to I was basing it on the fact
that<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.659> seeing<00:01:12.869> something<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> back

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that I was seeing something on the back

of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> outer<00:01:15.240> shell<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.290> gave<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
of the outer shell that gave me the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.560 
of the outer shell that gave me the
impression<00:01:17.010> that<00:01:17.430> possibly<00:01:18.030> something<00:01:18.330> could

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
impression that possibly something could

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.760 
impression that possibly something could
have<00:01:18.659> been<00:01:18.689> wrong<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> know

during manufacturing but you know after

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
during manufacturing but you know after
a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> research<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.460> talking<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
a little bit of research and talking to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870 
a little bit of research and talking to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
basically what happens here is when you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
basically what happens here is when you
get<00:01:35.670> ready<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.910> open<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.480> to<00:01:36.660> your<00:01:36.750> fingers

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
location so it's a little dirty but

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.010

thing<00:02:59.320> that<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.560> noticed<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.160> most<00:03:00.430> about<00:03:00.760> this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
thing that I noticed the most about this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.970 
thing that I noticed the most about this
is<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.560> case<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:04.450> adds

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
is that with this case on it adds

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.100 
is that with this case on it adds
significant<00:03:05.980> weight<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.790> your<00:03:06.820> iPad<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.989> know

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
significant weight to your iPad you know

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.390 
significant weight to your iPad you know
it<00:03:08.230> feels<00:03:08.380> like<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.770> almost<00:03:08.920> twice<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
it feels like it's almost twice the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.190 
it feels like it's almost twice the
weight<00:03:09.790> but<00:03:10.120> that's<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.510> good<00:03:10.630> thing<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.989> some

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
weight but that's a good thing in some

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.140 
weight but that's a good thing in some
