and I had to use that special link to be
extra<00:01:46.090> room<00:01:46.390> thing<00:01:46.780> on<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:47.140> bag<00:01:47.380> which<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:47.770> was

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
extra room thing on my bag which I was

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.740 
extra room thing on my bag which I was
kind<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.159> hoping<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.609> save<00:01:48.819> for<00:01:49.000> later<00:01:49.149> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
kind of hoping to save for later the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.020 
kind of hoping to save for later the
only<00:01:50.020> solution<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.679> I<00:01:50.710> see<00:01:51.069> in<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.670> realize

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
only solution that I see in the realize

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.419 
only solution that I see in the realize
that<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:52.630> way<00:01:52.869> lies<00:01:53.200> madness<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:54.069> to<00:01:54.250> buy

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
that this way lies madness is to buy

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.249 
that this way lies madness is to buy
more<00:01:54.700> bags<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.110> have<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.560> Japan<00:01:57.130> Rail<00:01:57.640> Pass

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
more bags and have the Japan Rail Pass

more bags and have the Japan Rail Pass
so<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.619> will<00:01:59.799> be<00:01:59.829> writing<00:02:00.490> some<00:02:00.969> more

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
so it will be writing some more

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.539 
so it will be writing some more
