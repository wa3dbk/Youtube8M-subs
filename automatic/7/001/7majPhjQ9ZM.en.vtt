from the dodocase so you can see we have

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.460 
from the dodocase so you can see we have
kind<00:03:35.770> of<00:03:35.830> bamboo<00:03:36.540> outline<00:03:37.540> here<00:03:37.840> now<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
kind of bamboo outline here now this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.070

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
appears to be a little bit more not a

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.390 
appears to be a little bit more not a
faction<00:03:41.470> has<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> finish<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.190> but

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
faction has a finish on it but

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.290 
faction has a finish on it but
definitely<00:03:42.700> has<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> glossy

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
definitely has more of a glossy
