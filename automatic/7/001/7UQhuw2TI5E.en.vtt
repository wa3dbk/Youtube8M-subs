so<00:00:46.649> destiny<00:00:47.309> isn't<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.730> launch<00:00:47.969> title<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.480> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so destiny isn't a launch title but it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
so destiny isn't a launch title but it's
pretty<00:00:48.899> much<00:00:49.050> an<00:00:49.289> exact<00:00:49.649> offset<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> what

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pretty much an exact offset to what

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
pretty much an exact offset to what
Activision<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.149> doing<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.539> Microsoft<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Activision is doing with Microsoft and I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
Activision is doing with Microsoft and I
would<00:00:52.890> argue<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.520> new<00:00:53.760> IP<00:00:53.969> coming<00:00:54.510> from

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
would argue that as new IP coming from

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
would argue that as new IP coming from
Bungie<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> would<00:00:55.649> rather<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> position

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
Bungie I would rather be in a position

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
Bungie I would rather be in a position
of<00:00:56.789> having<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> long-term<00:00:57.539> relationship<00:00:57.600> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
of having a long-term relationship with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
of having a long-term relationship with
Activision<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.949> destiny<00:00:59.489> than<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.030> call<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
Activision on destiny than on call of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
duty which has obviously been around for

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520 
duty which has obviously been around for
a<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.280> long<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> doesn't

PlayStation sku for a window of time

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
PlayStation sku for a window of time
along<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> fact<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.060> he<00:01:15.180> says<00:01:15.360> it's

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
along with the fact that he says it's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
along with the fact that he says it's
pretty<00:01:15.810> much<00:01:15.930> an<00:01:16.140> exact<00:01:16.530> offset<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> what

pretty much an exact offset to what

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
pretty much an exact offset to what
Activision<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.330> Microsoft<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Activision is doing with Microsoft I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.499 
Activision is doing with Microsoft I
definitely<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.220> means<00:01:20.549> early<00:01:20.909> DLC

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
definitely think that means early DLC

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.810 
definitely think that means early DLC
chances<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.460> exact

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
chances are it really will be an exact

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
chances are it really will be an exact
opposite<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.600> activation<00:01:25.170> does<00:01:25.350> with

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
opposite to what activation does with

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.289 
opposite to what activation does with
Microsoft<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> call<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> duty<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Microsoft on call of duty which is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
Microsoft on call of duty which is
obviously<00:01:27.600> 30<00:01:27.900> day<00:01:28.110> early<00:01:28.380> DLC<00:01:28.950> that's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
obviously 30 day early DLC that's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
obviously 30 day early DLC that's
something<00:01:29.880> I've<00:01:30.000> been<00:01:30.030> guessing<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
something I've been guessing at for a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
something I've been guessing at for a
long<00:01:31.079> time<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.530> especially<00:01:32.130> since<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.369> e3

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
long time now especially since at e3

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
long time now especially since at e3
they<00:01:33.119> said<00:01:33.329> their<00:01:33.450> deal<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> Sony<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they said their deal with Sony is a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
they said their deal with Sony is a
long-term<00:01:34.979> partnership<00:01:35.360> obviously<00:01:36.360> meaning

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
long-term partnership obviously meaning

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.179 
long-term partnership obviously meaning
that<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.810> stuff<00:01:37.020> coming<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.380> over<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
that it's stuff coming out over time and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
that it's stuff coming out over time and
not<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> few<00:01:38.939> things<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.360> launch<00:01:39.659> day<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
not just a few things on launch day so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
not just a few things on launch day so
again<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.490> clear<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.150> one

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
again just to be clear this is not one

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
again just to be clear this is not one
hundred<00:01:42.689> percent<00:01:42.899> confirmed<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> very

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
hundred percent confirmed but it is very

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.830 
hundred percent confirmed but it is very
very<00:01:44.520> likely<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
very likely that this means that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.780 
very likely that this means that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.170 
and they always show it off on the Sony
stages<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.310> we'll<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.760> seeing<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
stages so we'll just be seeing a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490 
stages so we'll just be seeing a
continuation<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
continuation of that and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
continuation of that and
probably<00:02:13.890> even<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.820> destiny<00:02:15.270> gets

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
probably even more of it as destiny gets

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
probably even more of it as destiny gets
closer<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.900> launch<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.800> other<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.220> he

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
closer to launch the other thing he

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
closer to launch the other thing he
mentions<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.880> PlayStation<00:02:18.510> hardware<00:02:18.690> bundles

mentions is PlayStation hardware bundles

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.630 
mentions is PlayStation hardware bundles
I<00:02:19.500> would<00:02:19.650> say<00:02:19.770> there's<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> good<00:02:20.160> chance<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
I would say there's a good chance that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.950 
I would say there's a good chance that
PlayStation<00:02:21.150> 4<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> be<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> only

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
PlayStation 4 is going to be the only

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.140 
PlayStation 4 is going to be the only
console<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> sort<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.130> destiny<00:02:23.580> edition

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
console to get a sort of destiny edition

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.270 
console to get a sort of destiny edition
of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.390> console<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.320> i<00:02:25.350> suppose<00:02:25.530> xbox<00:02:26.070> could

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
of the console but i suppose xbox could
