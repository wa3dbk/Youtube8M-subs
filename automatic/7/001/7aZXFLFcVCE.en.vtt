want to miss the action so we see

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.189 
want to miss the action so we see
actually<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> king's<00:00:20.369> gambit<00:00:20.820> by<00:00:21.199> nakamura

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
actually a king's gambit by nakamura

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.500 
actually a king's gambit by nakamura
which<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> quite<00:00:23.100> awesome<00:00:23.480> yesterday<00:00:24.480> he

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
which is quite awesome yesterday he

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.900 
which is quite awesome yesterday he
played<00:00:25.019> Queen<00:00:25.350> h5<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> second<00:00:26.340> move<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
played Queen h5 for a second move and I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
played Queen h5 for a second move and I
do<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> Kings<00:00:27.810> gambit<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.320> better

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
do think that the Kings gambit is better

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.020 
do think that the Kings gambit is better
here's<00:00:29.519> c6<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.840> d5<00:00:31.759> it's<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> be

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
here's c6 and then d5 it's going to be

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
here's c6 and then d5 it's going to be
the<00:00:33.090> move<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.239> he's<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:35.300> can

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the move that he's going for I can

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
the move that he's going for I can
actually<00:00:36.450> hit<00:00:36.980> okay<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> reason

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
actually hit okay so this is the reason

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
actually hit okay so this is the reason
why<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.480> longer<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.680> doing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
why it's longer is because now I'm doing

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.119 
why it's longer is because now I'm doing
it<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.280> crafty<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.600> bottom<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it with crafty on the bottom because I

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279 
it with crafty on the bottom because I
was<00:00:44.250> about<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> kramnik<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.570> Rodian

was about to do the kramnik a Rodian

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
was about to do the kramnik a Rodian

actually able to watch this with the wit

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually able to watch this with the wit
with<00:00:57.000> crafty<00:00:57.449> cracked<00:00:57.690> he's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> chess

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
with crafty cracked he's a chess

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
with crafty cracked he's a chess
computer<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> his<00:00:58.980> analysis<00:00:59.430> point<00:00:59.969> negative

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
computer and his analysis point negative

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
computer and his analysis point negative
negative<00:01:01.260> 1<00:01:01.649> means<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> black<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.329> by<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
negative 1 means that black is up by a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.750 
negative 1 means that black is up by a
pond<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.409> black<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.040> pawn<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pond here black is up by pawn and a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
pond here black is up by pawn and a
third<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> says<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.010> blacks<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
third is what it says so now blacks up a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.539 
third is what it says so now blacks up a
pond<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.340> give<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pond so I just and then it will give you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
pond so I just and then it will give you
a<00:01:11.580> few<00:01:11.820> moves<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.689> crafty<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.409> do

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
a few moves as to what crafty would do

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
a few moves as to what crafty would do
but<00:01:14.250> crafty<00:01:14.640> isn't<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.330> isn't<00:01:15.720> always

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but crafty isn't you know isn't always

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.330 
but crafty isn't you know isn't always
right<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.530> mean<00:01:16.710> generally<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.369> correct<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.049> at

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
right i mean generally is correct but at

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.620 
right i mean generally is correct but at
a<00:01:20.340> grand<00:01:20.640> master<00:01:20.939> level<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.330> some

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a grand master level there are some

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
a grand master level there are some
moves<00:01:21.900> where<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> computers<00:01:22.799> won't<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
moves where the computers won't see it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
moves where the computers won't see it
quickly<00:01:23.490> enough<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> g5<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.080> played<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> think

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
quickly enough so g5 is played I think

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.950 
quickly enough so g5 is played I think
it's<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:28.950> sick<00:01:29.369> look<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.450> heavily

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's pretty sick look it's it's heavily

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's pretty sick look it's it's heavily
defended<00:01:31.290> by<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> Queen<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> bishop

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
defended by the Queen and the bishop

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.950 
defended by the Queen and the bishop
right<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.820> defends<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.970> square<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
right and it defends this square and is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.090 
right and it defends this square and is
going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> pushing<00:01:37.409> forward<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> kick<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
going to be pushing forward to kick the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.020 
going to be pushing forward to kick the
night<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:39.150> night<00:01:40.340> may<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.579> retreat<00:01:41.939> at

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
night the night may have to retreat at

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.999 
night the night may have to retreat at
that<00:01:42.150> point<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> f4<00:01:43.500> Palmer<00:01:43.710> may<00:01:43.829> fall

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that point but at the f4 Palmer may fall

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
that point but at the f4 Palmer may fall
so<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.310> decides<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> defend<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.689> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
so he decides to defend it so this is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
so he decides to defend it so this is
like<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> line<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.890> his<00:01:47.009> opponent's<00:01:47.430> base

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
like a line in his opponent's base

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
like a line in his opponent's base
restricting<00:01:48.090> mobility<00:01:48.600> especially<00:01:49.049> for

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
restricting mobility especially for

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
restricting mobility especially for
example<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.799> Bishop<00:01:50.159> can't<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.880> very

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
example this Bishop can't really do very

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
example this Bishop can't really do very
much<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.200> problems<00:01:52.500> are<00:01:52.530> also<00:01:52.680> in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
much and all these problems are also in

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.139 
much and all these problems are also in
dark<00:01:53.009> squares<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> bishops<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:53.970> weak

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
dark squares so this bishops pretty weak

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
dark squares so this bishops pretty weak
this<00:01:54.390> square<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:55.049> available<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.100> night

Queen<00:02:04.680> comes<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.220> out<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.670> like

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Queen comes all the way out I do like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.229 
Queen comes all the way out I do like
this<00:02:07.160> but<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> bishop<00:02:08.489> comes<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
this but the bishop comes back this

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.550 
this but the bishop comes back this
Bishop<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.660> controlling<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> lot<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.440> light

squares<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:11.520> good<00:02:11.670> at

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
squares it's going to be pretty good at

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.850 
squares it's going to be pretty good at
the<00:02:11.910> defense<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.569> active<00:02:13.050> than<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.470> bishop

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the defense more active than this bishop

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380 
the defense more active than this bishop
which<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.489> basically<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.239> action

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
which is basically out of the action

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
which is basically out of the action
it's<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.840> looking<00:02:16.170> at<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.860> front<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's just looking at the front of a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's just looking at the front of a
brick<00:02:17.880> wall<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> sacrifice<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.590> but

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
brick wall this is a sacrifice it is but

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.949 
brick wall this is a sacrifice it is but
now<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.519> bishop<00:02:23.880> retreats<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
now the bishop retreats and then the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.240 
now the bishop retreats and then the
Queen<00:02:25.200> has<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.470> move<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> now<00:02:25.800> he<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.099> take

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
Queen has to move and now he can take

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.509 
Queen has to move and now he can take
the<00:02:26.370> bishop<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.319> dr.<00:02:28.560> murrow's<00:02:28.769> down<00:02:29.010> pretty

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
the bishop so dr. murrow's down pretty

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.520 
the bishop so dr. murrow's down pretty
significantly<00:02:29.870> he's<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
significantly he's not really on a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.330 
significantly he's not really on a
streak<00:02:31.950> lately<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:33.000> must<00:02:33.569> say<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.890> he<00:02:35.100> has

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
streak lately I must say but he has

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
streak lately I must say but he has
found<00:02:35.549> combinations<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.450> attack<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> king

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
found combinations to attack the king

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.620 
found combinations to attack the king
which<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.739> think<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.250> good<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.209> Bishop

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
which I do think is good but this Bishop

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.920 
which I do think is good but this Bishop
is<00:02:39.780> terrible<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.030> fish<00:02:42.269> could<00:02:42.330> go<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> d3

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
is terrible if this fish could go to d3

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.289 
is terrible if this fish could go to d3
just<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> trade<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.880> Bishop<00:02:45.150> then

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
just to trade off for that Bishop then

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.289 
just to trade off for that Bishop then
there'd<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.480> less<00:02:45.750> defense<00:02:47.150> we'll<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.269> I

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
there'd be less defense we'll see I

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.699 
there'd be less defense we'll see I
think<00:02:48.720> he'll<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.870> able<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.110> use<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.440> rook

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
think he'll be able to use this rook

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
think he'll be able to use this rook
though<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.489> he<00:02:50.610> has<00:02:50.730> four<00:02:51.060> pieces<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
though so he has four pieces in the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.630 
though so he has four pieces in the
attack<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.080> looks<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.290> there's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
attack but it looks like there's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.809 
attack but it looks like there's
probably<00:02:53.640> four<00:02:54.180> pieces<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.810> events<00:02:55.819> pun

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
probably four pieces of the events pun

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.960 
probably four pieces of the events pun

up to is played gaining a lot of space

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.280

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
against um pissant it looks like the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.520 
against um pissant it looks like the
black<00:03:01.769> pieces<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.459> pretty<00:03:02.819> active<00:03:03.180> c4<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.380> try

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
black pieces are pretty active c4 to try

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.840 
black pieces are pretty active c4 to try
to<00:03:04.590> break<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.950> Center<00:03:05.250> try<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.579> attack<00:03:06.090> d5<00:03:07.850> so

retreats<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.910> now<00:04:37.910> after<00:04:38.270> if<00:04:38.660> he<00:04:38.870> plays<00:04:39.080> c4

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
retreats and now after if he plays c4

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.100 
retreats and now after if he plays c4
then<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.370> move<00:04:40.550> might<00:04:40.880> be<00:04:41.000> really<00:04:41.150> good<00:04:41.419> he

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
then this move might be really good he

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.020 
then this move might be really good he
doesn't<00:04:42.530> play<00:04:42.680> c4<00:04:43.100> that's<00:04:43.430> what<00:04:43.580> crafty<00:04:43.880> saw

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
doesn't play c4 that's what crafty saw

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.879 
doesn't play c4 that's what crafty saw
crafty<00:04:44.510> saw<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.620> would<00:04:45.740> have<00:04:45.770> been

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
crafty saw it and that would have been

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.230 
crafty saw it and that would have been
sick<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> would<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:46.460> forced<00:04:46.669> like<00:04:46.970> Queen

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
sick it would have forced like Queen

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.150 
sick it would have forced like Queen
takes<00:04:47.419> because<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.470> pawn<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.740> defended<00:04:49.070> and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
takes because this pawn is defended and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.320 
takes because this pawn is defended and
then<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.370> could<00:04:49.490> take<00:04:49.610> out<00:04:49.729> c6<00:04:50.090> which<00:04:50.210> is

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
then you could take out c6 which is

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.030 
then you could take out c6 which is
really<00:04:50.570> good<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.440> he's<00:04:51.560> trying<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.830> maneuver

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
really good so he's trying to maneuver

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.760 
really good so he's trying to maneuver
though<00:04:52.370> he<00:04:52.580> does<00:04:52.760> get<00:04:52.910> his<00:04:53.030> going<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.300> jus<00:04:53.770> 626

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
though he does get his going to jus 626

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.400 
though he does get his going to jus 626
is<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.950> pretty<00:04:55.220> good<00:04:55.400> square<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.240> now<00:04:56.780> black<00:04:57.200> is

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
is a pretty good square so now black is

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.469 
is a pretty good square so now black is
up<00:04:57.770> 1.38<00:04:58.520> but<00:04:58.729> you<00:04:58.790> can<00:04:58.880> see<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.060> these<00:04:59.240> games

two pawns like the rook could just

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.620 
two pawns like the rook could just
capture<00:06:52.550> them<00:06:52.790> because<00:06:53.060> they're<00:06:53.180> all<00:06:53.330> there
