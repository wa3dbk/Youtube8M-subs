 Middle Ages Europeans made sweets 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.980
 from boiled sugar but because of the high 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.300
 the cost of imported cane 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.489
 sugar they were available only rich 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 only in the 19th century after it was found

 custom made and manually them 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.930
 production begins with the fact that 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.900
 Pan with water and sugar is adjusted to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.550
 boiling then add glucose empty 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.550
 syrup made from starch 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.260
 the mixture is heated to a certain 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.400
 temperature depending on the variety 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.280
 sweets and stew for half an hour 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 then liquid flavor is added 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.690
 after the mixture has become homogeneous and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.670
 and poured on a cooling table at the candy 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.610
 check there are various flavors 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.070

 these candy will be the image of strawberries 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.270
 so he his assistants work with 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.580
 three colors green for leaves in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 red for berries and yellow for the background 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.280
 lemon is added to enhance flavor 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.330
 acid 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.430
 mixing continues until 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.410
 until the mixture cools they become 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 a sufficiently viscous mixture is placed on 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.490
 heated table to slow down 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 hardening process to keep 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.890
 plasticity of caramel 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 now it's time to shape her 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.970
 narrow caramels of various shapes and sizes 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.070
 put together like a puzzle 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:56.120
 forming a drawing of the future 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:58.520
 candy after red berry 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.330
 green leaves yellow background took their 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.360
 place is added another background and a layer of red 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.430
 the caramel for the outer edge remains only 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:16.340
 turn this giant candy 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:19.180
 roller in the candy the usual size for 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.500
 this candy than squeezes one end and 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.070
 stretches it form a long strip 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.350
 which is called rod rod and 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.080
 60 pieces long 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.180
 centimeters they need to roll up to those 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.370
 until they cool down and harden 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.370
 otherwise they will become flat 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.350
 then the rod reaches the desired thickness 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.170
 drawing acquires perfect proportions 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.170
 now it only remains to chop candy 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.230
 also technology is applied when 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.410
 making candy Kiev 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.200

 and 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:31.400
 wai yu i love you and again yellow background and 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.140
 the red edge is then compressed stretching 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.140
 rolling and cutting 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:49.940
 until the rod turns out 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.860
 the right diameter if you look at 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.360
 you will see the rear end of the rods 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.360
 mirror image of letters 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.970
 candy mix removed from the cooling 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.980
 became transparent to make her 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.210
 opaque or lighter and and 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.770
 stretch with a hook 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.410
 here are caramel stripes of two colors 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.050
 intertwined and passing through the car 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.300
 which forms a ribbon of candy form 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.140
 cooling pads 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.060
 they just break apart so that everyone 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.790
 rods were happy even twisted in 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.790
 lollipops 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.790
