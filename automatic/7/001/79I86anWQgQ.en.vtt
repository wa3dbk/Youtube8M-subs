interested in coming along so it's a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.920 
interested in coming along so it's a
great<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.110> Andrew<00:01:04.380> here<00:01:04.620> today<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:04.979> well

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.320 

how<00:01:11.930> much<00:01:12.680> more<00:01:12.920> challenging

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
how much more challenging

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.540 
how much more challenging
as<00:01:14.840> well<00:01:15.200> as<00:01:15.410> trying<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.130> think<00:01:16.340> about

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
as well as trying to think about

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.000 
as well as trying to think about
composition

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
composition

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.880 
composition
exposure<00:01:19.880> you're<00:01:20.810> constantly<00:01:21.470> fighting

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
exposure you're constantly fighting

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.450 
exposure you're constantly fighting
against<00:01:22.460> AMC<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:27.440> not<00:01:27.620> sure<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.800> had<00:01:28.010> a<00:01:28.040> lot<00:01:28.430> of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
against AMC I'm not sure I had a lot of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.850 
against AMC I'm not sure I had a lot of
idea<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:28.910> style<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:29.990> quite<00:01:30.440> different<00:01:30.680> when

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
idea of style it's quite different when

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
idea of style it's quite different when
you<00:01:30.920> don't<00:01:31.070> know<00:01:31.160> what<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.400> expect<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.150> I

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
you don't know what to expect and I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.810 
you don't know what to expect and I
think<00:01:33.110> Allen<00:01:33.440> having<00:01:33.980> had<00:01:34.100> more<00:01:34.310> experience

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
think Allen having had more experience

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.470 
think Allen having had more experience
in<00:01:34.940> shooting<00:01:35.270> underwater<00:01:35.510> was<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:37.580> bit<00:01:38.330> more

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
in shooting underwater was a bit more

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.720 
in shooting underwater was a bit more
creative<00:01:38.930> with<00:01:38.960> backgrounds<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.310> was

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
creative with backgrounds and so I was

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.490 
creative with backgrounds and so I was
brought<00:01:40.760> in<00:01:41.150> server<00:01:41.360> just<00:01:41.630> trying<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.320> get

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
brought in server just trying to get

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.570 
brought in server just trying to get
some<00:01:42.710> shots<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.340> our<00:01:44.300> hair<00:01:44.690> in<00:01:44.930> model<00:01:45.320> space

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
some shots with our hair in model space

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.960 
some shots with our hair in model space
and<00:01:47.260> getting<00:01:48.260> dresses<00:01:48.890> floating<00:01:49.430> properly

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
and getting dresses floating properly

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.850 
and getting dresses floating properly
one<00:01:50.570> of<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.750> things<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:51.080> was<00:01:51.229> quite<00:01:51.440> keen<00:01:51.650> on

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
one of the things I was quite keen on

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.100 
one of the things I was quite keen on
was<00:01:52.130> actually<00:01:52.400> getting<00:01:52.790> colors<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:53.510> so<00:01:53.870> I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
was actually getting colors right so I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.160 
was actually getting colors right so I
chose<00:01:54.560> some<00:01:55.100> vivid<00:01:56.060> pink<00:01:56.330> dresses<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.080> I

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
chose some vivid pink dresses that I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.410 
chose some vivid pink dresses that I
thought<00:01:57.410> would<00:01:57.710> contrast<00:01:58.280> well

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
thought would contrast well

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.700 
thought would contrast well
water

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710

I think everyone's enjoyed it I do think

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.270 
I think everyone's enjoyed it I do think
certain<00:02:16.110> models<00:02:16.440> got<00:02:16.620> away<00:02:16.800> with<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> couple<00:02:17.130> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
certain models got away with a couple of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.190 
certain models got away with a couple of
good<00:02:17.430> shots<00:02:17.670> each<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.210> well

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.950 

so<00:02:25.200> lots<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.860> light<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.400> we've<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:27.450> fresnels

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
so lots of light and we've got fresnels

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.460 
so lots of light and we've got fresnels
