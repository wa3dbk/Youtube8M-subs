what a lot of got with scents version it
was<00:04:33.840> 4993<00:04:34.840> i<00:04:35.110> think<00:04:35.440> is<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.190> score<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.670> had

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
was 4993 i think is the score that I had

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.640 
was 4993 i think is the score that I had
when<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.330> sense<00:04:37.600> version<00:04:37.960> was<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.230> but<00:04:38.380> again

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
when the sense version was on but again

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.310 
when the sense version was on but again
as<00:04:38.860> always<00:04:39.730> say<00:04:40.090> benchmarking<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:40.960> just<00:04:41.170> a

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
as always say benchmarking it's just a

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.350 
as always say benchmarking it's just a
sort<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:41.830> its<00:04:42.130> supposed<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.850> give<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> guide

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.180 
sort of its supposed to give you a guide
and<00:04:43.660> not<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.080> make<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.560> decide<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:44.890> where

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
and not really make you decide on where

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.590 
and not really make you decide on where
they<00:04:45.280> buy<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.520> Hat<00:04:45.730> dance<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.330> are<00:04:46.450> not
