nail<00:04:05.650> polish<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:08.460> she<00:04:09.460> swatched<00:04:09.850> it<00:04:09.850> on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
nail polish and this she swatched it on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.110 
nail polish and this she swatched it on
a<00:04:10.150> fingernail<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:12.010> think<00:04:12.520> it<00:04:12.790> might<00:04:12.970> be<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
a fingernail so I think it might be a

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.430 
a fingernail so I think it might be a
little<00:04:13.240> too<00:04:13.360> pink<00:04:13.660> but<00:04:14.020> it<00:04:14.110> still<00:04:14.290> might<00:04:14.380> be

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
little too pink but it still might be

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.000 
little too pink but it still might be
kind<00:04:14.710> of<00:04:14.740> nice<00:04:16.080> hope<00:04:17.080> you<00:04:17.200> can<00:04:17.350> see<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.590> it
