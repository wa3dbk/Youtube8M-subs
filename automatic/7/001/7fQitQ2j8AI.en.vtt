water and really make sure that the wool
wash<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:19.220> water<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.520> absorbed<00:01:20.970> into<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
wash and the water get absorbed into the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.580 
wash and the water get absorbed into the
project<00:01:21.630> especially<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.320> easier

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
project especially it's a little easier

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
project especially it's a little easier
because<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.830> one's<00:01:23.040> small<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> bigger

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because this one's small but on a bigger

because this one's small but on a bigger
one<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.479> need<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> work<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.320> again

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
one you need to work a little bit again

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
one you need to work a little bit again
not<00:01:25.710> agitating<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

projects in general you need to use

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
projects in general you need to use
blocking<00:02:32.040> wires<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.990> blocking<00:02:34.940> set<00:02:35.940> of

what<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.150> after<00:02:39.530> after<00:02:40.530> taking

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
what you would do is after after taking

what you would do is after after taking
it<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.370> water<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.910> getting<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:43.640> dried

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it out of the water and getting it dried

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.830 
it out of the water and getting it dried
off<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.270> you're<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> put<00:02:45.750> it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
off a little bit you're going to put it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.510 
off a little bit you're going to put it
onto<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.140> block<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.500> show<00:02:46.770> us<00:02:46.950> how<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.130> put<00:02:47.370> in

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
onto the block and show us how to put in

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.280 
onto the block and show us how to put in
one<00:02:47.700> pin<00:02:48.060> sure<00:02:48.390> what<00:02:48.600> you'd<00:02:48.720> start<00:02:48.990> with<00:02:49.110> first

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
one pin sure what you'd start with first

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.840 
one pin sure what you'd start with first
is<00:02:49.470> doing<00:02:49.680> each<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.040> four<00:02:50.250> corners<00:02:50.520> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
is doing each of the four corners and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.880 
is doing each of the four corners and
then<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.240> work<00:02:51.510> from<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> middle<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.470> create<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
then I work from the middle and create a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.650 
then I work from the middle and create a
new<00:02:53.100> middle<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.580> create<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> new<00:02:54.270> middle<00:02:54.510> until

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
new middle and create a new middle until

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.520 
new middle and create a new middle until
they're<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.050> done

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
they're all done

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.950 
they're all done
so<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.100> our<00:02:56.430> about<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> half<00:02:57.570> inch<00:02:57.750> apart

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
so what is our about a half inch apart

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.600 
so what is our about a half inch apart
about<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> half<00:02:58.590> inch<00:02:58.740> apart<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.460> have

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
about a half inch apart you really have

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.010 
about a half inch apart you really have
to<00:02:59.730> eyeball<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.150> depending<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> project

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
to eyeball it depending on the project

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.300 
to eyeball it depending on the project
