streamer on and we'll see how that goes

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.900 
streamer on and we'll see how that goes
it's<00:00:54.079> probably<00:00:54.410> not<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.620> good<00:00:54.860> idea<00:00:54.920> but<00:00:55.760> we're

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's probably not a good idea but we're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.000 
it's probably not a good idea but we're
gonna<00:00:56.000> try<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.360> anyway<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.960> hopefully<00:00:57.469> it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
gonna try it anyway and hopefully it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.680 
gonna try it anyway and hopefully it
doesn't<00:00:58.160> cause<00:00:58.399> any<00:00:58.430> crashes<00:00:59.089> and<00:00:59.480> it's<00:00:59.600> a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
doesn't cause any crashes and it's a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.030 
doesn't cause any crashes and it's a
little<00:00:59.899> breezy<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:00.320> it's<00:01:00.800> not<00:01:01.010> bad

for<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.780> second<00:05:00.139> part<00:05:00.169> of<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:00.470> video<00:05:00.770> I'm

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
for the second part of this video I'm

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.969 
for the second part of this video I'm
gonna<00:05:01.520> try<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.820> do<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.389> vertical<00:05:03.110> takeoff

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
gonna try to do a vertical takeoff

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.390 
gonna try to do a vertical takeoff
so<00:05:05.080> we'll<00:05:06.080> try<00:05:06.229> they<00:05:06.680> did<00:05:06.860> it<00:05:07.010> on<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.190> flight

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
so we'll try they did it on the flight

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.230 
so we'll try they did it on the flight
test<00:05:07.639> why<00:05:08.120> can't<00:05:08.389> I<00:05:08.539> do<00:05:08.599> it<00:05:08.810> -<00:05:08.990> that's<00:05:09.650> my<00:05:09.800> -<00:05:10.240> not

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
test why can't I do it - that's my - not

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.110 
test why can't I do it - that's my - not
really<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.630> don't<00:05:11.660> know<00:05:11.870> how<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.020> decide<00:05:12.320> that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
really I don't know how to decide that

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.490 
really I don't know how to decide that
all<00:05:14.120> right<00:05:14.300> we're<00:05:14.690> gonna<00:05:14.780> try<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.110> vertical

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
all right we're gonna try the vertical

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.930 
all right we're gonna try the vertical
takeoff<00:05:15.919> I<00:05:16.099> think<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.460> thing<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.729> help<00:05:16.910> the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
takeoff I think the thing to help the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.900 
takeoff I think the thing to help the
most<00:05:17.270> was<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.110> flight<00:05:18.349> test<00:05:18.590> logo<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.340> think

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
most was the flight test logo I think

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.629 
most was the flight test logo I think
that<00:05:20.090> was<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.360> biggest<00:05:20.539> winner<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.800> here<00:05:22.520> we

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
that was the biggest winner so here we

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.920 
that was the biggest winner so here we
go<00:05:22.760> on<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.090> vertical<00:05:24.020> takeoff<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.800> if<00:05:25.340> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
go on the vertical takeoff if the if the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.140 
go on the vertical takeoff if the if the
streamer<00:05:26.930> hits<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.380> don't<00:05:27.830> move<00:05:28.010> because<00:05:28.520> it

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
streamer hits you don't move because it

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:37.130 
streamer hits you don't move because it
probably<00:05:29.300> will<00:05:31.090> all<00:05:32.090> right<00:05:32.210> here<00:05:32.389> we<00:05:32.449> go<00:05:32.599> one

for<00:06:25.090> me<00:06:43.320> two<00:06:44.320> for<00:06:44.500> two<00:06:44.680> landings<00:06:45.370> yes<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.800> both

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
for me two for two landings yes and both

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.440 
for me two for two landings yes and both
flights<00:06:48.070> were<00:06:48.280> awesome<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:48.940> first<00:06:49.150> one<00:06:49.330> was

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
flights were awesome the first one was

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.550 
flights were awesome the first one was
hand<00:06:49.690> ham<00:06:50.170> lunch

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
hand ham lunch

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.410 
hand ham lunch
the<00:06:50.980> second<00:06:51.280> one<00:06:51.370> was<00:06:51.550> a<00:06:51.580> BT<00:06:52.000> Oh<00:06:52.030> which<00:06:52.390> means

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
the second one was a BT Oh which means

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.170 
the second one was a BT Oh which means
vertical<00:06:52.780> takeoff<00:06:53.290> I<00:06:53.620> saw<00:06:54.580> someone<00:06:54.820> else<00:06:54.940> say

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.000 
vertical takeoff I saw someone else say
VTO<00:06:55.630> so<00:06:55.990> I<00:06:56.050> thought<00:06:56.230> I'd<00:06:56.350> use<00:06:56.650> that<00:06:56.830> in<00:06:56.920> my

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
VTO so I thought I'd use that in my

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.940
