one<00:00:27.900> priority<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.590> winter<00:00:28.890> camping<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
one priority when winter camping is

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.299 
one priority when winter camping is
staying<00:00:29.970> warm<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> use<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.590> electric<00:00:31.710> heater

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
staying warm so I use an electric heater

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.729 
staying warm so I use an electric heater
to<00:00:32.969> warm<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.360> RV<00:00:33.690> instead<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.440> running<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
to warm the RV instead of running the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
to warm the RV instead of running the
propane<00:00:35.190> furnace<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
propane furnace I do that because the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
propane furnace I do that because the
propane<00:00:37.710> creates<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.820> humidity<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
propane creates a lot of humidity and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.040 
propane creates a lot of humidity and
humidity<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.590> RV<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> winter<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
humidity in an RV and the winter is

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
humidity in an RV and the winter is
definitely<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.350> enemy<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> nobody<00:00:44.760> likes

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
definitely your enemy and nobody likes

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.130 
definitely your enemy and nobody likes
frozen<00:00:45.360> cabinets<00:00:45.840> walls<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> windows<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
frozen cabinets walls and windows so I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340 
frozen cabinets walls and windows so I
keep<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> propane<00:00:50.039> furnace<00:00:50.550> set<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.420> 45

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
keep the propane furnace set at 45

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
keep the propane furnace set at 45
degrees<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> my<00:00:53.520> failsafe<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
degrees it's kind of my failsafe just in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
degrees it's kind of my failsafe just in
case<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.899> electric<00:00:55.350> heaters<00:00:55.620> fail<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.100> some

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
case my electric heaters fail for some

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
case my electric heaters fail for some
reason<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.910> propane<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.539> still<00:00:57.780> kick<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
reason my propane will still kick on and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
reason my propane will still kick on and
I<00:00:59.039> won't<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.309> any<00:00:59.489> colder<00:00:59.789> than<00:00:59.969> 45<00:01:00.449> degrees<00:01:01.969> we

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I won't be any colder than 45 degrees we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.490 
I won't be any colder than 45 degrees we
cook<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> griddle<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> an<00:01:04.170> induction

furnace cooking with propane even
breathing<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.030> creates<00:01:12.600> humidity<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
breathing all creates humidity and if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350 
breathing all creates humidity and if
that<00:01:14.220> moisture<00:01:14.640> starts<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> become<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.270> problem

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that moisture starts to become a problem

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
that moisture starts to become a problem
you<00:01:15.930> may<00:01:16.200> need<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> crack<00:01:16.740> event<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.490> let<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you may need to crack event to let it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
you may need to crack event to let it
escape<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> good<00:01:19.530> idea<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> keep<00:01:20.009> like

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
escape so it's a good idea to keep like

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
escape so it's a good idea to keep like
a<00:01:20.220> damp<00:01:20.490> red<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.090> dry<00:01:21.360> Zee<00:01:21.540> air<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.810> board<00:01:22.080> just

extra<00:01:24.210> humidity<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.040> nifty

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
extra humidity so we have this nifty

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
extra humidity so we have this nifty
little<00:01:26.580> thermometer<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.270> helps<00:01:27.600> us<00:01:27.720> see

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
shoes are an absolute must because the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.390 
shoes are an absolute must because the
floors<00:02:10.429> get<00:02:10.789> really<00:02:11.600> chilly<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:13.190> want<00:02:13.340> to

this<00:02:16.820> helps<00:02:17.120> kind<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.390> create<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.720> barrier

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
this helps kind of create a barrier

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.350 
this helps kind of create a barrier
between<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:19.190> inside<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.760> outside<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
between the inside and the outside so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.150 
between the inside and the outside so
the<00:02:20.450> heat<00:02:20.600> stays<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> cold<00:02:21.620> stays<00:02:21.950> out

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
the heat stays in and the cold stays out

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.010 
the heat stays in and the cold stays out
now<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.030> want<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.300> take<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.570> another<00:02:23.750> step

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
now if you want to take it another step

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.540 
now if you want to take it another step
further<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.560> actually<00:02:24.709> get<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.220> heavy

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
further you can actually get a heavy

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
further you can actually get a heavy
fabric<00:02:26.150> or<00:02:26.390> blanket<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.080> adhere<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
fabric or blanket and adhere that to the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.100 
fabric or blanket and adhere that to the
inside<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> windows<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.840> seems<00:02:30.020> to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
inside of the windows but this seems to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.710 
inside of the windows but this seems to
work<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.290> fine<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.650> us<00:02:31.240> last<00:02:32.240> but<00:02:32.570> certainly

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
work just fine for us last but certainly

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.560 
work just fine for us last but certainly
not<00:02:33.170> least<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:34.190> double<00:02:34.640> walled<00:02:34.850> press<00:02:35.270> for

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
not least is a double walled press for

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.270 
not least is a double walled press for
your<00:02:35.660> coffee<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.170> tea<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.100> way<00:02:37.190> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
your coffee and tea so that way it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.020 
your coffee and tea so that way it
actually<00:02:37.610> stays<00:02:37.820> hot<00:02:39.430> well<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.580> about<00:02:40.700> sums

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
actually stays hot well that about sums

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.550 
actually stays hot well that about sums
