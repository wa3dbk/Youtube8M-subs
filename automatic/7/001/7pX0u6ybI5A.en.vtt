just filmed another video and um it was

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.869 
just filmed another video and um it was
a<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> side<00:00:42.260> edgy<00:00:43.260> Punk<00:00:44.190> hairstyle<00:00:44.760> I

a kind of side edgy Punk hairstyle I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.069 
a kind of side edgy Punk hairstyle I
don't<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.570> cold<00:00:45.870> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
don't know what it's gonna be cold but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
don't know what it's gonna be cold but
it'll<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> butt<00:00:46.559> bar<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.789> hair<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it'll be the butt bar and so my hair is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.240 
it'll be the butt bar and so my hair is
kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> curly<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.710> hair<00:00:49.860> doesn't<00:00:50.039> have

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
kind of curly but your hair doesn't have

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
kind of curly but your hair doesn't have
to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> curly<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> start<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.719> better<00:00:52.110> if

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to be curly to start with it's better if

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.310 
to be curly to start with it's better if
it's<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.980> natural<00:00:53.280> um<00:00:53.930> like<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> think

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's just like natural um like I think

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.880 
it's just like natural um like I think
this<00:00:55.410> works<00:00:55.620> better

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this works better

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
this works better
just<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.579> wavy<00:00:57.030> hair<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.510> straight<00:00:58.050> hair

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
just like wavy hair and straight hair

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
just like wavy hair and straight hair
but<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.309> wouldn't<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> top<00:01:00.000> section<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
but you wouldn't get the top section of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
but you wouldn't get the top section of
your<00:01:00.629> hair<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.109> its<00:01:01.199> ear<00:01:01.350> from<00:01:01.649> ear<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> just

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
like they look like a bunch little

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.510 
like they look like a bunch little
thread<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:25.229> screwing<00:05:25.560> yes<00:05:25.979> right<00:05:26.250> just

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
thread and I'm screwing yes right just

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.369 
thread and I'm screwing yes right just
because<00:05:26.879> it<00:05:27.120> takes<00:05:27.330> too<00:05:27.690> long<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:28.050> really

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
because it takes too long you really

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.020 
because it takes too long you really
didn't<00:05:28.620> want<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.919> just<00:05:29.069> come<00:05:29.280> unraveling<00:05:29.879> that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
didn't want to just come unraveling that

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.089 
didn't want to just come unraveling that
easily<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:30.960> they're<00:05:31.139> pretty<00:05:31.349> stiff<00:05:31.889> like

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
easily but they're pretty stiff like

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.309 
easily but they're pretty stiff like
they're<00:05:32.280> not<00:05:32.400> going<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> come<00:05:32.819> undone<00:05:33.000> like<00:05:33.900> if

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
they're not going to come undone like if

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.529 
they're not going to come undone like if
you<00:05:34.710> just<00:05:34.979> leave<00:05:35.370> them<00:05:35.610> for<00:05:35.909> a<00:05:35.970> while<00:05:36.150> like

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
you just leave them for a while like

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.809 
you just leave them for a while like
they<00:05:36.780> won't<00:05:37.020> just<00:05:37.289> young<00:05:37.680> really<00:05:38.129> easily<00:05:38.550> just

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
they won't just young really easily just

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.670 
they won't just young really easily just
fall<00:05:39.030> out<00:05:39.210> like<00:05:39.449> through<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.110> day<00:05:40.289> they<00:05:40.470> might

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
fall out like through the day they might

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.119 
fall out like through the day they might
but<00:05:40.949> like<00:05:41.129> not<00:05:41.340> instantly<00:05:42.500> so<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.530> really<00:05:43.949> like

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
but like not instantly so I really like

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.730 
but like not instantly so I really like
the<00:05:44.280> effect<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.819> this<00:05:44.969> and<00:05:45.270> um<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.590> gets

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
the effect of this and um it gets

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.559 
the effect of this and um it gets
shorter<00:05:47.069> hair<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.550> would<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.669> a<00:05:47.789> lot<00:05:48.060> easier<00:05:48.210> to

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
shorter hair it would be a lot easier to

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.629 
shorter hair it would be a lot easier to
do<00:05:48.810> because<00:05:49.259> you<00:05:49.440> don't<00:05:49.620> have<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.009> take<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.610> to

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
do because you don't have to take it to

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.570 
do because you don't have to take it to
tangled<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.270> long<00:05:51.449> bit<00:05:51.659> but<00:05:52.409> as<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:52.830> can<00:05:53.009> see

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
tangled in a long bit but as you can see

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.119 
tangled in a long bit but as you can see
I<00:05:54.030> think<00:05:54.479> it<00:05:54.870> looks<00:05:55.020> pretty<00:05:55.169> realistic<00:05:55.620> like

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
I think it looks pretty realistic like

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.399 
I think it looks pretty realistic like
the<00:05:56.280> actual<00:05:56.520> thing<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.690> really<00:05:58.080> do<00:05:58.199> like<00:05:58.379> it

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
the actual thing and I really do like it

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.369 
the actual thing and I really do like it
I<00:05:58.710> didn't<00:05:58.949> really<00:05:59.930> understand<00:06:00.930> here<00:06:01.110> just

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
I didn't really understand here just

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.860 
I didn't really understand here just
because<00:06:01.710> like<00:06:02.340> I<00:06:02.669> thought<00:06:02.879> look<00:06:03.090> kind<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.360> um

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
because like I thought look kind of um

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.619 
because like I thought look kind of um
alright<00:06:04.469> without<00:06:04.949> doing<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.969> if<00:06:06.479> you
