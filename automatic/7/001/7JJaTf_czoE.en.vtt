00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 I will conduct the violin concerto 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 number 2 of mendelssohn 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.429
 I would like to say that in the in this 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.469
 concerto there are small sequences that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 are signings of mendelson 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.630
 especially at mozart in the third 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 movement 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 we can notice a musical pattern that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 looks like the era of the magic flute 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.440
 I 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.370
 flight it's an orchestra exclusively 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 amateur that was founded two years ago to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 about three people who are 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 florent course and guillaume game and me on 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 had started this year on the idea of â€‹â€‹a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
 concerto could that will play our 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.150
 friend then benedict around that we have 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.680
 articulated opening opening 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.970
 coriolan beethoven on bass and a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.949
 opening of a play 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.800
 so it's coriolan it's obviously 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.210
 think of shakespeare and it's a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 heroic character so there is a lot 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 of violence in this music since 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.820
 is a coriolan war that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 finally comes that has been banned by 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 Rome who comes to take revenge with the enemy 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.439
 to attack his former boss 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.799
 all this is translated no music from 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.799
 belfry 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.930
 beethoven actually this is one of my 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.000
 first loves in music it's with 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 him that I started especially at the piano 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.390
 jean these piano sonatas 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 I was very interested in these 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.750
 symphonies by the way I directed them 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.670
 in my room 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.830
 jean-marc is a great student 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.180
 in two classes of music it's a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.100
 scholar it's a specialist traits 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.869
 of beethoven and it's mostly a student 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.340
 of my friend roger tessier not to seek 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.710
 an orchestra to study 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 the orchestration and that's good they 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 did not have timpani there is so they 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.549
 have me president hu and the timbales and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.259
 after they offered me to put to the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.820
 guillaume direction which is first 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.580
 violin alternates between his position 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.250
 first vo is chef guillaume 20 cursus 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.390
 conservatory oblet meda and at the circus this 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.259
 which I particularly like 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.259
 in the direction 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.600
 it's the way we can make you want 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 is given and allow others to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.230
 understand what you want and it's a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.300
 fight I have is science and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.260
 to transmit the musical intention 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.260
 that I want to give to the musicians 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.350
 gold what is it an amateur orchestra 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.690
 but one thing that is important for 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.069
 we also of course share the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.709
 music to our audience but also 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.780
 to have a somewhat generous approach and 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.630
 so the product of our concerts is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.470
 given to charities or or 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.470
 public interest
