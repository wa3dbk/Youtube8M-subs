00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 this is android rus computer 2013 exhibition 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 at the company's booth rinse there is one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.010
 interesting novelty it is called lumi 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.559
 tab 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.990
 that's how it looks like this is tablet 7 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 inch basically nothing special with 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
 Mind can scroll small screen like everyone else 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.529
 Androids is worth android 4 2 all 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 works in principle quite fast 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 inside there is a dual-core processor 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.350
 texas instruments processor 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 one and a half and a hertz 1 gigabyte operational 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 of memory 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 screen with a resolution of 1024 by 600 too 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 mediocre enough but 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.260
 An interesting trick she lies here in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.219
 this let's look at this wall 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 on this white wall now 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 a picture will appear here given this is the first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 tablet with a built-in projector here 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.730
 so i will dedicate to you like this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 looks give let's see how it is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 image actually works 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.289
 which comes out of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 projector but a little bit different and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.600
 resolution of 854 by 480 such as 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.820
 the screen here you can do all the usual things 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 which you do just on the tablet 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 can run various applications and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 of course watch movies to watch 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.259
 films here have all the necessary 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.930
 things inside the country battery for four 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 thousand eight hundred milliamper hours and this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.259
 Of course, a little but in principle on how 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.409
 time to watch one movie 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 somewhere at 3 o'clock and and that's enough well maybe 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.840
 Of course all trilogies lord of the rings you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.119
 can not see 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 from one charge but in principle first 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.820
 parts I think to master and besides you can 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 connect a mouse to this thing so as not to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 walk just put show 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 movie friends and to manage through 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630
 far away with the mouse here she is like that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.950
 works 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.899
 a mouse appears on the android screen 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.360
 a little bit strange but still so she 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.049

 the house button you can press everything with 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.840
 using the mouse, but by the way this cable 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.159
 comes complete 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 roller by the way, you can 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.999
 flipping screens also got for the ban 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 give around to run for example 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.189

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.929

 Well you can play too 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.890
 even in the company 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.360
 if you have a big room the farther 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.069
 treat the projector the more 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.629
 image becomes can 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 adjust focus 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.450
 a small pen right now i'm building and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.019
 if there is a little more in the room 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.030
 dark 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.959
 you can play please i lost 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.209
 it seems but not always successfully with 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.920
 these pigs 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.640
 advertisements all expect from them between and 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 unpredictable and green so well let's 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.069
 now let's look at this one a little 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.260
 novelty in her hands she is funny 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 she has a lot of different rusichi buttons 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.310
 this button turns on the projector 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.650
 actually like this 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.260
 we have a focus control from above 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.810
 volume control power button 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.630
 and from this side just all the ports 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.739
 who can only imagine 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.370
 please actually earpiece slot for 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.730
 memory cards micro beaten name with dima and 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.099
 still charging it charges using 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.380
 special adapter 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.069
 Well actually it is still all all one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.930
 parties just 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.190
 hidden in front we have a front 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.049
 camera by the way yes and uninteresting 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.900
 Experience is possible front camera 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.349
 run run through 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.970
 so it looks like he turned off our dear 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.670
 turn on 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.020
 by the way without the included projector 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.660
 charges you enough for about 10 hours 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.370
 as representatives tell us so much 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.989

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.110
 adjust the focus turn on the camera and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.090
 can for example broadcast huge 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.560
 head yourself for example the next house and 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.620
 so here is something to say menacingly 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.209
 only wow yes this is one of the scenarios 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.470

 such as hiking and night on the sheet and 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.910
 broadcast some sort 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.790
 good video is not what you think 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.859
 You can also make presentations. 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.840
 when it comes like you don't need 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.760
