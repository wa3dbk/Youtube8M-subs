00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.160
 We started very happy because the year 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 last we started with a project to unite 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 this famous binomial of gastronomy and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 came with a third element that is the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.839
 culture worked wonderfully at the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.369
 people liked it a lot we took it to 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.130
 tour various places in the city 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.380
 mexico very nice maybe some a little 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 unknown and it was a success then 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.560
 this year we decided to do this same 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 this same dynamic but looking 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.100
 places outside the city ​​of mexico 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 soon that people could take a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 day or maybe a weekend for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 know very nice places and continue with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 this proposal to publicize the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.310
 gastronomy and of course the bathrooms 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.660
 this experience from tepoztlan was 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.440
 incredible the dynamics was very nice 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.280
 independently of this merger of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.620
 gastronomy wine and culture was to approach 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.210
 the people to the roots to mexico to what 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.890
 is produced in Mexico to all these 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.050
 wonderful ingredients and this 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.520
 diversity that Mexico has and that of 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.890
 soon it is a bit unknown for 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
 us in the city especially but 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.119
 It also sought to bring people closer to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.310
 the traditional cooks to these 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.380
 ancestral recipes to these techniques of 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.680
 kitchen that have so many years in Mexico 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 Even before the miscegenation, we received 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.360
 the people in the market so that for 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.430
 They could just like we did in the market 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.920
 san juan be in contact with and with 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.020
 the products that are produced here in 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.869
 Tepoztlan saw them we introduced them 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 they tried some things then we went to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.140
 the famous and kaká test that is something that 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.500
 you have to do in tepoztlan when 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 you are here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.400
 we tried itacate there is a very famous place 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 in the market where there are several sauces 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 of various flavors then we put them 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 in ones as of tees to the people all the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 sauces so they could try a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.800
 very comfortable way and you're not there in the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.780
 market a little complicated and then 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 we toured the ex-convent 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.130
 for the convent of the nativity 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.390
 We carry a guide like all 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.280
 tours that we do in the boutique 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.819
 we always put together a team very 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.640
 professional after we made a 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.590
 visit to a place that is the inn 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 Tepozteco is a hotel that has a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.340
 awesome view we chose it for that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.810
 because we want people to have the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.700
 record opportunity to take some 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.069
 good pictures of taking a drink 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.469
 sparkling we made this famous pairing of 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.010
 mole with a sparkling wine with our 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:39.650
 chamberlain and people poses this with 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.659
 He served us some mole pesitos 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.579
 and well later we got home 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.290
 fernanda which is a very boutique hotel 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.290
 nice that is here in tepoztlan 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.100
 and here I think that came the most 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.800
 fun that was to bring people to 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:02.960
 prepare things that are so typical for 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.960
 we eat a tamale and an omelet and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:14.820
 let's go to the people it's the first time 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:18.090
 it is done this I liked very much in the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.800
 experience was very nice with a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.510
 molcajete sauce they were presented 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.030
 all the ingredients plus some 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.490
 as additional toppings like 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.390
 grasshoppers and nuggets and they could 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.430
 put together your own recipe for salt 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.470
 and finally we ended up with a menu 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 tasting of five prepared times 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.520
 by Fernanda house that in the end were 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.730
 six because they decided to put a time 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.390
 additional on the menu and we start 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.840
 our our food with a wine 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.400
 pink that was the best pink cabernet 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.800
 known as spring 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.380
 later we continue with the room 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.330
 of private reserve we continue after 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.050
 with the concorde that is mixture of syrah and 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.050
 Cabernet Sauvignon 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.070
 I think the marriage is perfect between 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.040
 the Mexican cuisine the clh wines and I think 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.930
 that comfort you the soul I think it is 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.630
 one thing well planned and I think it's a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.450
 which many people must taste 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.380
 Y 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.680
 enjoy the fact of making the tamale 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.510
 tortillas to grind there in the metate no 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.550
 it's not an unusual experience 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.140
 later a wine land of the 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.660
 line don Luis that is made with 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.690
 four grapes cabernet sauvignon merlot 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.970
 malbec and petit verdot and let's make a 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.400
 exercise of pairing because we are going to 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.960
 marinate that dish that is based on 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.960
 mole with jam bruce 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.129
