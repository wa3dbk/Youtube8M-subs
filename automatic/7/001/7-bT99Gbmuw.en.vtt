00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hey, what's up, beauty, what are you talking about?

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.790
 video and we will talk about violence and 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.370
 Yes, the youngsters are accustomed to games. 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.290
 to see the news in the media saying that the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 boy played gta was there and killed in the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 next the kid was playing I do not know what 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.730
 talk and kill I do not know who all this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.980
 it would have been much too much 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 strange if this news were not already the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 opposite is God blessed the boy 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 play has nothing to do with it did not kill 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 no one old is better than he was 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 Yes, he murdered himself. Yes, that's it. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.320
 even in this bizarre world we are there 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 Seeing is a boy of 21 years and not 23 years 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 I remember exactly now it did not turn white 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 he was mega addicted to online rpg games 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 and everything else 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 and then the father lost the old line lost to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 line with the kid for some reason x and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 went there and killed him there comes the problem 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 and we have this news you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 follow the link is in the description 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 she half of the eurogamer site yes one of the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.699
 greatest references to games there year in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.530
 news and tals is a website 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.000
 really good, I really get a lot 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 news from there and always has a content 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 very cool, well selected 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 The problem is that this news is more 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.340
 tendentious staff as well as 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 In fact they say that the father lost his 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.180
 with his son because he liked 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.369
 a lot of online games and killed the son 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 which makes no sense at all 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 then they say their father killed 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.490
 accidentally in the midst of a 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 to know exactly what originated the fight 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 there on the site understand that originated 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.630
 because of the games his father was in 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.570
 avoided the only playable son of the game 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.909
 fifa the gate went up I know what 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 finally tendentious news once more 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.329
 we see the media the media our media 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.579
 of games 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.950
 going against the face speaking preaching this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.259
 idea does not come out of games as if what 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 had anything to do with it not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 It's true that the father killed himself. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
 total uncontrolled brother is personal and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.930
 It has nothing to do with the boy is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.899
 playing or not automatically deny 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.149
 blame already goes through video game then site 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.189
 news type of thing have to take 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.290
 very special care with him he is 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.599
 there their media is the old video game 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.459
 How does a guy do a news for the site? 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.790
 of games implying that the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.730
 video game influenced in the hand 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.980
 one more person or continue 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.739
 this way we will hardly be taken 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.709
 seriously one day he thought to twist to 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.150
 that the site take a little bit of simÃ£o with 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.310
 dodo level of information that they were 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.560
 this news to you can check 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.680
 still the description is in Portuguese because 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.540
 You are a gamer from portugal, I went there. 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.519
 checked and how are you talking at the end 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 of the accounts the news was very negative 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.739
 for us gamers once more we are 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.930
 passed this idea that the game is 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.700
 murders have some relation in the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.849
 Indeed we see that it was just a fight 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.319
 of a family that is very badly resolved is personal 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.129
 Anyway, we're used to this type 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.010
 of thing 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.349
 Let's hope this does not affect the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
 our world our beloved world of games 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.829
 it's not personal this is another video opa 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.669
 excuse hits the microphone is another 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.019
 different format of the channel and 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.819
 I really hope you are 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.620
 enjoying this new destiny formed 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.230
 are farther you will see the face 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.450
 then glued on the screen until some 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 beautiful elements I think I think 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.569
 cool, I 'm now seeing how it's that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.609
 I'm going to work on background music and everything. 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.859
 but anyway I think we already have there 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.400
 more or less a new base for the channel 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.400
