00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.540 
broke so how do you anyone so right now
it's<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.390> stood<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.749> a<00:00:45.809> candle<00:00:46.620> thingy

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's like stood up on a candle thingy

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's like stood up on a candle thingy
right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:47.999> so<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.079> tell<00:00:49.530> me<00:00:49.769> I'm

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
right now so that it can tell me I'm

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.709 
right now so that it can tell me I'm
doing<00:00:50.249> it<00:00:50.460> what's<00:00:50.609> on<00:00:50.760> my<00:00:50.850> iPad<00:00:51.239> video<00:00:51.480> because

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
doing it what's on my iPad video because

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
doing it what's on my iPad video because
I<00:00:51.780> figured<00:00:52.140> it'd<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.260> easy<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.640> without<00:00:53.909> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I figured it'd be easy to do without and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
I figured it'd be easy to do without and
a<00:00:54.780> tripod<00:00:55.230> well<00:00:56.069> probably<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.519> exactly<00:00:56.789> easy

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
a tripod well probably not exactly easy

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.739 
a tripod well probably not exactly easy
easy<00:00:57.929> but<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.409> figured<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.269> it's<00:01:00.269> like<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.479> fast

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
easy but I figured that it's like a fast

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.209 
easy but I figured that it's like a fast
little<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.409> because<00:01:01.979> I<00:01:02.069> was

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
little bit because because I was

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.400 
little bit because because I was
planning<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.579> doing<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.819> different<00:01:03.149> video<00:01:03.239> but

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
planning on doing a different video but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.950 
planning on doing a different video but
my<00:01:04.410> tripod<00:01:05.130> is<00:01:05.370> broken<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.120> can't<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
my tripod is broken so I can't do that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
my tripod is broken so I can't do that
