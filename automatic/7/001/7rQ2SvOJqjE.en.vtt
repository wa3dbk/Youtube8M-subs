there to hit them it's pain in the ass
but<00:03:23.130> when<00:03:24.000> you're<00:03:24.120> bursting<00:03:24.270> these<00:03:24.510> combos

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
but when you're bursting these combos

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.200 
but when you're bursting these combos
particularly<00:03:26.490> common<00:03:26.640> what<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.910> want<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.120> do

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
particularly common what you want to do

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.930 
particularly common what you want to do
is<00:03:27.390> as<00:03:27.690> best<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.590> keep<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.340> them<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:29.850> at

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
is as best you can keep on them but at

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.460 
is as best you can keep on them but at
the<00:03:30.030> same<00:03:30.210> time<00:03:30.390> stay<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.900> fear<00:03:31.260> range

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the same time stay out of fear range

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.780 
the same time stay out of fear range
this<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.160> going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.340> be<00:03:32.460> very<00:03:32.550> difficult

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
this is going to be very difficult

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.570 
this is going to be very difficult
obviously<00:03:33.180> because<00:03:34.130> when<00:03:35.130> they're<00:03:35.250> running<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
obviously because when they're running a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.890 
obviously because when they're running a
pole<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.630> kill<00:03:36.750> me<00:03:36.780> a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
pole like this you have to kill me a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.720 
pole like this you have to kill me a
close<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.260> him<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.470> try<00:03:37.710> and<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.340> them<00:03:38.640> I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
close to him and try and get on them I

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.220 
close to him and try and get on them I
actually<00:03:38.820> accidentally<00:03:39.600> deterrence<00:03:40.020> they're

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
actually accidentally deterrence they're

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.020 
actually accidentally deterrence they're
meant<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> do<00:03:41.220> my<00:03:41.340> clave<00:03:41.580> talks<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
meant to do my clave talks but I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.520 
meant to do my clave talks but I
certainly<00:03:42.180> hit<00:03:42.420> shift<00:03:42.690> six<00:03:42.960> instead<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.320> six

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
certainly hit shift six instead of six

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.670 
certainly hit shift six instead of six
which<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.740> why<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.820> turrets<00:03:45.180> very<00:03:45.810> very<00:03:46.200> very

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
which is why the turrets very very very

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.220 
which is why the turrets very very very
bad<00:03:46.890> thing<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:47.640> yeah<00:03:48.630> happens<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
bad thing to do but yeah happens I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.250 
bad thing to do but yeah happens I

warriors<00:04:35.850> is<00:04:36.090> they<00:04:36.690> have<00:04:36.930> defensives<00:04:37.590> now

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
warriors is they have defensives now

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.170 
warriors is they have defensives now
obviously<00:04:38.220> they<00:04:38.310> need<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.730> macro<00:04:38.970> to

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
obviously they need to have a macro to

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060 
obviously they need to have a macro to
get<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.330> shield<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.840> sword<00:04:40.080> once<00:04:40.680> they<00:04:40.860> do<00:04:40.920> that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
get a shield and sword once they do that

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.800 
get a shield and sword once they do that
they<00:04:41.340> become<00:04:41.610> pretty<00:04:42.000> much<00:04:42.210> impossible<00:04:42.390> to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
they become pretty much impossible to

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.690 
they become pretty much impossible to
kill<00:04:42.960> for<00:04:43.140> me<00:04:43.290> with<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> few<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.250> my<00:04:44.340> cooldowns

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
kill for me with a few of my cooldowns

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.580 
kill for me with a few of my cooldowns
up<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.420> is<00:04:45.540> going<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.810> even<00:04:45.960> worse<00:04:46.320> next

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
up this is going to be even worse next

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.170 
up this is going to be even worse next
patch<00:04:46.860> because<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:47.460> can<00:04:47.580> do<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.790> without<00:04:47.910> the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
patch because they can do it without the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.090 
patch because they can do it without the
shield<00:04:48.390> on<00:04:48.570> they<00:04:49.140> can<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.440> pop<00:04:49.920> it

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
shield on they can just pop it

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.470 
shield on they can just pop it
immediately<00:04:50.460> pop<00:04:50.820> shield<00:04:51.000> wall<00:04:51.210> without<00:04:51.330> a

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
immediately pop shield wall without a

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.060 
immediately pop shield wall without a
shield<00:04:51.690> pop<00:04:52.050> spelling<00:04:52.980> without

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
shield pop spelling without

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
shield pop spelling without
shield<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.610> it's<00:04:53.700> going<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.880> be<00:04:53.940> extremely

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
shield so it's going to be extremely

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.520 
shield so it's going to be extremely
hard<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.450> kill<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> war<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.930> next<00:04:55.110> patch<00:04:55.230> as

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
hard to kill a war in the next patch as

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.230 
hard to kill a war in the next patch as
you<00:04:55.980> see<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.220> my<00:04:56.340> monk<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.670> just<00:04:56.850> drinking

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
you see that my monk is just drinking

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.600 
you see that my monk is just drinking
out<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.510> open<00:04:57.630> they<00:04:58.290> these<00:04:59.190> guys<00:04:59.430> were

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
out in the open they these guys were

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.000 
out in the open they these guys were
good<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.020> actually<00:05:01.170> think<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.770> war<00:05:01.980> is

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
good and I actually think the war is

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.580 
good and I actually think the war is
gladiator<00:05:02.520> got<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> warrior<00:05:03.690> but<00:05:04.320> they<00:05:04.470> just

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
gladiator got a warrior but they just

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.590 
gladiator got a warrior but they just

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.870 
carrying because we win so much we get
into<00:05:46.260> high<00:05:46.410> brackets<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.100> we<00:05:47.490> want<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:47.730> drop

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
into high brackets and we want to drop

into high brackets and we want to drop
the<00:05:48.060> rating<00:05:48.360> unless<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.690> get<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.840> few<00:05:49.020> losses<00:05:49.230> in

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
the rating unless we get a few losses in

the rating unless we get a few losses in
a<00:05:49.530> row<00:05:49.590> so<00:05:50.490> i<00:05:50.520> go<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.880> warrior<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.210> tried<00:05:51.510> the

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
a row so i go the warrior I tried the

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.690 
a row so i go the warrior I tried the
priest<00:05:51.840> there<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.350> I'm<00:05:53.070> thinking<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.640> could

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
priest there and I'm thinking I could

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.280 
priest there and I'm thinking I could
get<00:05:53.940> in<00:05:54.060> here<00:05:54.210> but<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.570> priest<00:05:54.870> gets<00:05:55.110> out<00:05:55.200> of

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
get in here but the priest gets out of

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.840 
get in here but the priest gets out of
the<00:05:55.350> trap<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.710> think<00:05:55.890> she'd<00:05:56.010> drink<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.610> up<00:05:56.670> by

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
the trap I think she'd drink it up by

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.180 
the trap I think she'd drink it up by

which<00:07:08.759> by<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.150> way<00:07:09.240> is<00:07:09.360> probably<00:07:09.539> one<00:07:09.810> of<00:07:09.870> the

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
which by the way is probably one of the

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.749 
which by the way is probably one of the
most<00:07:10.169> hated<00:07:10.560> abilities<00:07:11.279> in<00:07:11.400> the<00:07:11.430> game<00:07:11.490> at<00:07:11.729> the

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
most hated abilities in the game at the

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.909 
most hated abilities in the game at the
moment<00:07:11.999> and<00:07:12.090> then<00:07:12.150> he<00:07:12.240> goes<00:07:12.360> stealth<00:07:12.719> I<00:07:12.960> mean

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
moment and then he goes stealth I mean

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.279 
moment and then he goes stealth I mean
it's<00:07:14.520> even<00:07:14.789> worse<00:07:15.000> when<00:07:15.150> say<00:07:15.539> a<00:07:15.779> priest<00:07:16.139> will

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
it's even worse when say a priest will

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.610 
it's even worse when say a priest will
live<00:07:16.469> swap<00:07:16.740> a<00:07:17.539> hunter<00:07:18.539> and<00:07:18.569> 100<00:07:19.050> occurrences

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
live swap a hunter and 100 occurrences

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.830 
live swap a hunter and 100 occurrences
it's<00:07:19.860> literally<00:07:20.279> like<00:07:20.400> a<00:07:20.460> complete<00:07:21.060> reset<00:07:21.659> as

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
it's literally like a complete reset as
