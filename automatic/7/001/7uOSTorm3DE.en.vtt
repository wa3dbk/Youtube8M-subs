00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello everyone, I want to introduce my cosmetic bag contents today. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 My cosmetic bag is it 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This bag was bought when a sample sale was held three years ago. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 There is also a small handbag on it. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 There is also a large plastic tote bag on top. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Three groups are only three thousand yuan 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I bought a very good bag. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I have these things in my cosmetic bag. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 The first is the most important IPSA concealer in the bag. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 There are three colors of concealer inside. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 If you put a foundation on your makeup, it’s really a makeup. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But it will give people a very white look. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 So I will take this to the dressing room. If there are dark circles, I will click it a little. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 There are also acne, etc. You can also use this cover to draw a natural makeup. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Next is the bright makeup of YSL. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 This has also been introduced before, not only can it conceal it, it is a bit pink and pearly. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Like this, it is very feminine when it is painted directly and slightly pushed like a bright make-up. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 If there is a date at night, this must be with you. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Then I will bring this pink blush 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 There must be its own puff in the blush, no matter how good the blush brush or puff is wrong, it is not easy to color and cause failure. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I love to use the MAC brush that was used two or three years ago. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 After brushing it with a brush, brush it off on your hand and then brush it on your face. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 This way you can draw a very beautiful blush 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 No matter what time, I will definitely wear a blush brush. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 I will also bring this small brush of BOBBI which is very soft. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 This is used to make up the makeup. I am not using a puff, but I can use the brush to absorb some oil and make up the makeup even if I don’t have a foundation. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Finally, this fragrance oil is very good. I probably recommend it to more than 100 people. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 This is AYURA's Night Meditation aroma oil 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 This is actually used in the humidifier air purifier. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I like this scent too much. It’s also the taste in the studio. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 I will rub it on my clothes bag and my wrist. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Although the instructions say that it can not be rubbed on the skin, it does not actually cause skin inflammation. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 This is a refreshing and natural fragrance than the perfume. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 There is a feeling of healing, so I highly recommend this AYURA Night Meditation aroma oil 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Finally, the eye drops I have been taking since the high school students. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 My eyes are very dry at any time, I forgot to blink my eyes. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Very refreshing effect, so eye drops are very important to me. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 The eyes are very moist and look more lovely, so this is my necessities. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 The above is all the things in my cosmetic bag啰
