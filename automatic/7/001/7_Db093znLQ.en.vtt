00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 recognized company in Alsace but 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 also in Lorraine and in

 who wish to build is before 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.520
 all from one interlocutor who will know 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.219
 take into account his needs and especially 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 translate them into three-dimensional begel 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 architecture will accompany you in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 this approach since most of our 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.609
 customers never built and that's 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 often their first building 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.080
 we will know how to translate all of your 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 needs by accompanying you with a point 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 administrative technical point of view and

 for more than 20 years bgl designs and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 realizes buildings for the tpe 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 SMEs in the region 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.079
 these references are multiple 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.539
 local authorities and 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.640
 hospitalers choose bgl for 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:36.630
 innovative construction solutions and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.729
 controlled we realize buildings 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.270
 essentially framing and cladding 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.399
 metallic 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 these are buildings that are realized 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.750
 dry assemblies on which uses very little 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.189
 of reinforced concrete the reinforced concrete is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 basically used for 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.970
 foundations and tiling big advantage 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.929
 of this technique is the speed 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.539
 execution 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.340
 Nevertheless, these techniques require that 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.619
 a great rigor at the level of studies 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.049
 in doing so we can guarantee crimes 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.700
 targeting very short the order of four 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.049
 month all state body for a building 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.049
 of 1000 square meters 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.579
 bg the architect to realize on the site

 of the youth seminar in walbourg on 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.410
 new internship in August 2010 this building 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.750
 made of timber and cladding 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 metallic has allowed us to guarantee a 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.900
 delivery time of eleven months for a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.840
 cost of 1000 euros per square meter 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 you can see that despite the fact 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.139
 whatever the metal frame 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.959
 we manage to make buildings that they 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.700
 be very nice with colors 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.230
 with courtyards where greenery 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.230
 participates in the architecture of the building 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.160
 the bgl methodology is the fruit 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.600
 an expertise that will bring you the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.950
 confidence needed for investment 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.870
 realized bg the architectured is in 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.580
 ability to offer you two solutions 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.320
 the separate state body where one found 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.520
 general interests of the TLC clan 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.040
 appeared to be the master of wrought 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.570
 concerns a permanent look at the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.550
 work done for companies 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.200
 interests of the general contractor it's 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.670
 the time gained outside the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.260
 definition of the specifications for the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.730
 company manager begel looks after 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.760
 of the entire construction and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.100
 book a turnkey building the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.270
 particularity of bgl is to do the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.850
 synthesis of two professions 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.440
 the architect and the builder 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.320
 also try to do so that's the one 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.750
 architecture what so work on 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.100
 the forums together on your building has 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 worked on the colors on the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.020
 decoration on the design the look all that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.540
 for that actually at a given moment 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.610
 it emerges a minority at the level of 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.200
 any building something that is 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.910
 naturally you may like it 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.850
 who will come off a bit of the park 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.500
 surrounding and here and there and it will 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.120
 trying tasks is really something 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.650
 something that sticks to your image 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.110
 something like 10 really god 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.349
 unique 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.900
 [Music] 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.849
 you have a rehabilitation project 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.220
 building extension in off with 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.590
 architecture bgl give to your 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.140
 company a new face it be 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.770
 functional that you're proud of and
