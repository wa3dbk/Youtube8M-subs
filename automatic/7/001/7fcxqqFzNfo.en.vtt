now<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:01.170> are<00:00:01.290> slabs<00:00:01.680> are<00:00:02.100> leather<00:00:02.399> hard

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
now that are slabs are leather hard

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.140 
now that are slabs are leather hard
we're<00:00:03.179> ready<00:00:03.419> for<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.589> second<00:00:05.160> step<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:06.170> our

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
we're ready for the second step of our

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.640 
we're ready for the second step of our
firm<00:00:09.150> slab<00:00:09.690> box<00:00:10.230> assembly<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:12.380> you'll<00:00:13.380> notice

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
firm slab box assembly and you'll notice

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.740 
firm slab box assembly and you'll notice
that<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.099> couple<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.700> slabs<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.450> some

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
that a couple of my slabs have some

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
that a couple of my slabs have some
cracks<00:00:16.049> here<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> edges<00:00:16.949> that's<00:00:17.460> okay

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
cracks here on the edges that's okay

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
cracks here on the edges that's okay
we'll<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.539> avoid<00:00:18.720> those<00:00:19.260> cracks<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.949> we'll

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we'll just avoid those cracks and we'll

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.820 
we'll just avoid those cracks and we'll
use<00:00:20.550> those<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.180> part<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.630> our<00:00:21.750> edges<00:00:24.560> in<00:00:25.560> order

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
use those as part of our edges in order

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.479 
use those as part of our edges in order
to<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:28.130> straight-sided<00:00:29.390> firm<00:00:30.390> slab<00:00:30.869> box<00:00:31.489> we

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to get a straight-sided firm slab box we

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
to get a straight-sided firm slab box we
need<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.450> diligent<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> our

need to really be diligent to our

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.610 
need to really be diligent to our
measurements<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.320> use<00:00:37.320> our<00:00:39.620> drafters

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
measurements and use our drafters

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.200 
measurements and use our drafters
triangle<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.399> sure<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> our

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
triangle make sure that all of our

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
triangle make sure that all of our
corners<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> good<00:00:43.500> 90<00:00:43.829> degrees<00:00:44.510> I'm

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
corners are at a good 90 degrees I'm

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779 
corners are at a good 90 degrees I'm
going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> start<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.980> edge<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
going to start with my first edge and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.660 
going to start with my first edge and
cut<00:00:48.719> off<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> portion<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.010> slab<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
cut off the portion of that slab that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.020 
cut off the portion of that slab that
has<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> crack<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> you'll<00:00:53.340> notice<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:54.000> not

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
has the crack and you'll notice I'm not

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.740 
has the crack and you'll notice I'm not
cutting<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.649> way<00:00:55.800> through<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.579> once<00:00:56.750> I'm

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
cutting all the way through at once I'm

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.580 
cutting all the way through at once I'm
making<00:00:58.199> several<00:00:58.530> passes<00:00:59.930> remember<00:01:00.930> our<00:01:01.140> slab

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
making several passes remember our slab

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.479 
making several passes remember our slab
is<00:01:01.829> leather<00:01:02.070> hard<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.760> still<00:01:03.090> fairly<00:01:03.570> firm<00:01:04.489> so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
is leather hard but still fairly firm so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.230 
is leather hard but still fairly firm so
if<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.939> tried<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> cut<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.140> once<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:08.240> might

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
if I tried to cut it all at once I might

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.410 
if I tried to cut it all at once I might
actually<00:01:09.510> crack<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.100> slab<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> we'll<00:01:15.060> remove

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually crack the slab so we'll remove

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
actually crack the slab so we'll remove
that<00:01:16.049> cracked<00:01:16.560> piece<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.729> working<00:01:20.729> off

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that cracked piece and now working off

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
that cracked piece and now working off
this<00:01:21.240> straight<00:01:21.689> edge<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:23.220> decide

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
this straight edge I have I can decide

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
this straight edge I have I can decide
how<00:01:25.759> large<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.689> box<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:30.380> if<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
how large I want my box to be if I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.390 
how large I want my box to be if I
measure<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.400> edge<00:01:32.700> o<00:01:33.799> def<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> cracks

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
measure this edge o def and the cracks

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
measure this edge o def and the cracks
remember<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> include<00:01:36.689> those

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
remember I don't want to include those

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
remember I don't want to include those
yeah<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.329> could<00:01:39.329> make<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.869> side<00:01:40.520> six<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
yeah I could make this side six and a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
yeah I could make this side six and a
half<00:01:41.790> inches<00:01:42.090> tall<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.950> seems<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
half inches tall and that seems like a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.039 
half inches tall and that seems like a
good<00:01:44.850> height<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> mark<00:01:47.840> six<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
good height so I'm going to mark six and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.260 
good height so I'm going to mark six and
a<00:01:49.110> half<00:01:52.729> up<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.180> edge<00:01:54.829> I'm<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.270> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a half up this edge I'm going to make a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
a half up this edge I'm going to make a
little<00:01:57.750> mark<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> reference<00:01:58.740> they'll

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
little mark here for reference they'll

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.170 
little mark here for reference they'll
tell<00:01:59.850> me<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.960> my<00:02:01.170> slab<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> be

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
tell me how all my slab is going to be

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.469 
tell me how all my slab is going to be
before<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.450> cut<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> height<00:02:04.880> now<00:02:05.880> lay<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.329> my

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
before I cut the height now lay down my

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.270 
before I cut the height now lay down my
drafters<00:02:06.960> triangle<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
drafters triangle and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.410 
drafters triangle and
the<00:02:09.580> second<00:02:10.060> edge<00:02:10.300> square<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:13.150> I'm<00:02:13.300> going

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the second edge square because I'm going

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.030 
the second edge square because I'm going
to<00:02:13.510> need<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.870> edge<00:02:14.280> perfectly<00:02:15.280> well<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to need this edge perfectly well I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
to need this edge perfectly well I
square<00:02:18.040> before<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.520> cut<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.330> edge<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.990> will

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
square before I cut the edge that will

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.840 
square before I cut the edge that will
determine<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> height<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.890> sex<00:02:27.489> with

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
determine the height all this sex with

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.800 
determine the height all this sex with
my<00:02:28.000> drafters<00:02:28.569> triangle<00:02:29.290> look<00:02:30.420> line<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.660> on

my drafters triangle look line it on

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.850 
my drafters triangle look line it on
that<00:02:32.680> straight<00:02:33.190> edge<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.470> cut<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
that straight edge and I can cut the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.229 
that straight edge and I can cut the
height<00:02:40.800> remember<00:02:41.800> give<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.400> few<00:02:43.300> passes

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
height remember give it a few passes

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.170 
height remember give it a few passes
don't<00:02:46.239> try<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.570> cut<00:02:46.840> through<00:02:47.050> all<00:02:47.200> at<00:02:47.320> once

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
don't try and cut through all at once

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.810 
don't try and cut through all at once
wait<00:02:49.180> till<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.540> slab<00:02:49.840> separates<00:02:50.560> evenly<00:02:51.310> you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
wait till the slab separates evenly you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.840 
wait till the slab separates evenly you
can<00:02:51.970> see<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> pop<00:02:52.450> free<00:02:52.840> there<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.370> set<00:02:54.670> these

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
can see it pop free there and set these

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.390 
can see it pop free there and set these
pieces<00:02:55.150> aside<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.920> make<00:03:03.100> sure

to<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.819> how<00:03:04.920> wide<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.340> want<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.970> edge<00:03:12.030> 10

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.590 
to see how wide I want this edge 10
inches<00:03:13.570> seems<00:03:13.959> like<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.200> good<00:03:14.500> mark<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.709> we'll

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
inches seems like a good mark so we'll

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.650 
inches seems like a good mark so we'll
go<00:03:19.600> 10<00:03:20.079> inches<00:03:21.420> myself<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.510> reference<00:03:22.989> mark<00:03:24.660> for

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.390 

once<00:03:33.310> again<00:03:34.140> cutting<00:03:35.140> making<00:03:35.650> sure<00:03:35.860> my<00:03:36.010> life

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
once again cutting making sure my life

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.330 
once again cutting making sure my life
is<00:03:36.700> parallel<00:03:37.269> up<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.690> down<00:03:38.220> holding<00:03:39.220> my

sometimes<00:03:45.310> these<00:03:45.459> odd<00:03:45.700> angles<00:03:46.180> we<00:03:46.330> have<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
sometimes these odd angles we have to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.539 
sometimes these odd angles we have to
pull<00:03:46.810> with<00:03:47.170> an<00:03:47.440> opposite<00:03:47.860> hand<00:03:48.129> can<00:03:48.400> be<00:03:48.519> a

pull with an opposite hand can be a
little<00:03:48.730> awkward<00:03:49.049> don't<00:03:50.049> throw<00:03:50.500> these<00:03:50.769> pieces

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
little awkward don't throw these pieces

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.979 
little awkward don't throw these pieces
away<00:03:51.459> we'll<00:03:51.819> use<00:03:52.090> these<00:03:52.299> for<00:03:52.569> our<00:03:52.599> flange

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
away we'll use these for our flange

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.509 
away we'll use these for our flange
later<00:03:53.409> so<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.799> have<00:03:53.890> good<00:03:54.099> straight

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
later so if you have good straight

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.479 
later so if you have good straight
pieces<00:03:54.900> set<00:03:55.900> those<00:03:56.170> aside<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:57.040> keep<00:03:57.280> them

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
pieces set those aside and keep them

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:06.720 
pieces set those aside and keep them
moist<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> we<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.459> our<00:04:00.670> first<00:04:00.730> edge<00:04:01.510> cut<00:04:05.730> and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
moist so we have our first edge cut and

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.420 
moist so we have our first edge cut and
it<00:04:06.879> is<00:04:07.030> 10<00:04:07.329> inches<00:04:09.870> by<00:04:10.870> six<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> half<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:14.430> our

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
it is 10 inches by six and a half so our

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.000 
it is 10 inches by six and a half so our
box<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.269> going<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.479> have<00:04:16.660> six<00:04:16.900> sides<00:04:17.289> we<00:04:17.859> need

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
box is going to have six sides we need

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.870 
box is going to have six sides we need
three<00:04:18.549> pairs<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.570> matching<00:04:19.930> slabs<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.639> I<00:04:21.699> need

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
three pairs of matching slabs so I need

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.700

to<00:04:21.970> make<00:04:22.060> one<00:04:22.330> more<00:04:22.600> slab<00:04:23.020> with<00:04:23.530> these

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
to make one more slab with these

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.170 
to make one more slab with these
dimensions<00:04:24.340> I'm<00:04:24.520> going<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.729> set<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.000> one

here<00:04:38.250> start<00:04:39.250> by<00:04:40.229> cutting<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.500> straight<00:04:41.860> edge

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
here start by cutting that straight edge

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.680 
here start by cutting that straight edge
along<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.490> bottom<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:43.599> can<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.780> I'm<00:04:44.289> using<00:04:44.349> a

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.360 

real<00:07:11.690> close<00:07:12.050> to<00:07:12.260> the<00:07:12.410> edge<00:07:12.560> of<00:07:12.890> this<00:07:12.980> one<00:07:13.220> so

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
real close to the edge of this one so

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.040 
real close to the edge of this one so
I'm<00:07:13.430> just<00:07:13.640> going<00:07:13.760> to<00:07:13.850> basically<00:07:14.030> just<00:07:14.630> trim

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
that edge off that's all I'm going to do

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:26.080 
that edge off that's all I'm going to do
to<00:07:17.450> this<00:07:17.600> one

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090

perfect cube you can make one that's a

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.680 
perfect cube you can make one that's a
rectangular<00:07:37.110> box<00:07:37.350> that<00:07:38.250> is<00:07:38.610> completely<00:07:39.300> up<00:07:39.660> to

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
rectangular box that is completely up to
