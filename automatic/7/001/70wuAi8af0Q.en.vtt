00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.130
 hello everybody is squeezing that at 38 and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.940
 gameplay on modern warfare 3 in melee 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.850
 general on the map then needed 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.830
 it's a small little attempt 30,01 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.360
 perfect it's always fun and 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.220
 as you may have noticed in the beginning 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.660
 of video have already my first 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.880
 new introduction I hope she 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.230
 you will like it changes from the old a little 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.780
 rotten time must admit now 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.580
 and then that of code qg cotc f1 because 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.000
 that I intend to send them this 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.680
 gameplay 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.720
 because I think it's really 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.310
 a huge part that I did and I 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.350
 really want to share it at most 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.110
 of people possible then as you 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.150
 could have noticed it if I play on the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.650
 yanis account 38 years so I have my 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 friend ianis 38 years old I was at home at 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.100
 moment of the game so it's me who 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.020
 were playing and in addition I will present a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.390
 little more digital but I played on his 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.610
 little tv all rotten with the cape and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.960
 quality ritalin all rotten so what 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.440
 made it a little bit more 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.119
 difficult 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.580
 good as you may have noticed I 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.369
 play with them the silent n80 a 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.149
 pact with the worst assets assassins 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.380
 track the killstreaks specialists 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.110
 with undetectable sleight of hand 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.819
 and bones trigger this is it and 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.380
 that's why for a good little 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.880
 massacre good in his gameplay I 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.440
 wanted to give you some advice 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.420
 to make months that I found 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560
 because those on my channel do not 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.390
 do not know I'm not an expert in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.330
 hard objects slammed six or seven to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.490
 maximum so I will share with you 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.869
 some techniques I could 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.240
 use which have served me a lot for 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.190
 succeed a few months so first of all 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.899
 I think that for even a 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.280
 good sensitivity good sensitivity 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.720
 10 and very good reflexes 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.160
 because as you probably have 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.350
 noticed we die at a speed 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.759
 unbelievable we pass limits of life to 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.619
 death finally short I will not you 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.970
 redo my speech 1 to criticize 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.890
 modern warfare 3 i think all the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.849
 world has understood since time so 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.740
 that's why I advise you a 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.220
 big sensitivity of very very good 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.229
 reflexes 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.759
 after I obviously advise you to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.440
 take a good weapon a good choice in 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.370
 say to you take a quick ppt 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.410
 nas etc. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.610
 but take standard to which of the word you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.980
 are comfortable if you are trying 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
 with once the mans took it there must 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.970
 really that's huge worried you 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.570
 know how to play you know aimed etc 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.310
 What this example really beats No. 4 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.530
 to cope well with yet if we 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.720
 look at the statistics they were going 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.820
 not valid and alain I want to say 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.170
 but I can even better use it than 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.700
 weapons that have better 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.860
 statistics yet but after that it's 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.910
 everyone who sees after ben I you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.140
 precisely advises products a 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.700
 weapon adapted to the map 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.410
 it is true that you are going hard 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.900
 apply to 9 pm on bakara 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.250
 I take an example at random and it's 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.720
 does it on big brands like that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.190
 it's more an assault rifle advise 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.080
 and then also take assets that we 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.370
 adapted to map one for example on 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.260
 of men a small bangash is aimed 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.940
 solid it would be good 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.840
 advise because when a funeral 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.160
 close combat 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.959
 finally I will not make you a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 tutorial on every map I think you 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.840
 have understood I wanted to come from 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.640
 huge assets adapted to the map 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.490
 I think it's a little bit 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.170
 advised by after ben I you 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.850
 advises two rocks one to do the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.650
 outline of the hand after I know that there 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.690
 who prefer to defend a position 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.250
 that is, to go from one point to another 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.030
 to go back and forth 1 up 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.709
 proclaims wab arrives 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.209
 I personally do not like it too much 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.550
 what age technique prefers to do 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.750
 cuts from the complete laps of map 1 and 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.550
 kill all the enemies you 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.440
 meet a month I quickly I quickly 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.300
 in addition to going inside the map 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.400
 in the middle since we 're never at 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.050
 the shelter of a camper from a bad dream 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.690
 crazy about bullshit like that finally short 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.880
 I prefer to do the con tour after ben 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.170
 that's it we do not choose one but go 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.000
 really have a lot of luck because 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.890
 that you are never safe from a 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.870
 camper of a dead key of a predator 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.760
 a bad respawn of this bullshit 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.500
 like that you think it will really have 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.489
 rely on luck but my loan there 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.230
 there is no tutorial to have 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.860
 luck and you have it where you have not 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.450
 after that used to see finally brief 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.280
 here are my tips for you 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.720
 do your little month after month 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.739
 fashions that I finally tell you that me 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.000
 I do it best anyway 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.440
 after that it's my opinion a train field 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.720
 to give you my opinion after in action 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.250
 can agree or not the modes of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.860
 I find it easier to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.480
 to do is dominance and 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.640
 demolition for me personally 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.350
 after there is the match to death if you are 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.670
 fast but that's really not my 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.829
 trick because I like to take 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.110
 my time and everything is the match but there 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.670
 we really do not have much time 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.440
 because if you do a series of 10 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.850
 for example, you break your series 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.870
 good it's dead for this part it goes 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.000
 have to wait for the next 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.830
 so that's why I like it 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.540
 I like it even if I get broken 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.580
 my series will be able to continue in 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.110
 demolition domination in demolition by 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.720
 number we do not have time anymore 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.580
 it's true that in general melee me 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.660
 I 'm not telling you if I have 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.650
 slammed obame in any case if I them 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.180
 slaps and that would have been my first 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.030
 because in general scrum 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.170
 I tried a few times but the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.780
 responsible campers etc 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.490
 if I dropped what but there must 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.630
 to say that I was very lucky and 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.030
 after a little technique that I have 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.190
 found low after this fire it depends 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.540
 but what I noticed is that 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.520
 if you play in the morning you have 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.800
 tendency to meet players a little 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.870
 less experienced than she is what 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.770
 I think the real ones the real nolife 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.180
 the little ones the real geeks 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.100
 I think he says though rather the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.930
 console in the evening it's true that I did 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.460
 this part in the morning and I found 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.250
 that levels were a little bit 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.660
 lower but good after that it's 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.360
 clichés to preach not true or not 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.729
 but that's what I saw 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.560
 here are some small maps 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.450
 to do the months I advise you 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.979
 medium sized maps bola at 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.110
 passage I am at 23.0 I you 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.270
 will announce the hands of the mayor who has failed 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.500
 break my series I tell you 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.540
 my guy was beating it down there I 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.490
 I was going to repeat to a near moribund 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.900
 that my series so the year it's going to be my 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.370
 last he can see there me I you 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.310
 suspenseful suspense 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.360
 the Argentine is put in my helmet and where 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.610
 the beautiful Like I bang 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.310
 unblocks maemo ab-all but 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.840
 24 that he sees the young person right now and 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.220
 look at the bottom left 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.500
 look at me all these rocks is leaving 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.940
 here are four straight in a row 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.490
 it's really not fair play 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.810
 to do without it even me it happens to me 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.270
 take me months ba it happens it's 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.130
 life is fake kitco and at 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.530
 final my mob who will do that small 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.950
 they are very annoying but hey it's 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.590
 the fact 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.630
 that's a pity including rage quit 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.950
 like that for me but good finally short 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.310
 it's the community have not come back 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.110
 above 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.240
 so there that moment I say to myself that there 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.560
 now are you left infotel 30 0 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.410
 so here I will try not to 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.729
 to kill here is that we are 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.130
 had all the assets specialists ans 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.080
 it's really we really feel 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.120
 helpless because no I wanted 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.650
 invincible because here we aim for a 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.050
 incredible speed we run to a 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.699
 incredible speed and that's it 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.349
 it really gives a huge advantage over 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.490
