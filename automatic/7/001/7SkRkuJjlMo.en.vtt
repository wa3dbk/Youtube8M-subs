00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello and welcome to certain classes to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 learn to machine sew in this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 chapter we will explain how it is reeling 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 the tap or how is it said that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.869
 currently we are going to wind the thread 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 in the tap on the bottom of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.740
 sewing machine as we have already 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 mentioned in the previous class the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.859
 sewing machines perform sewing 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.199
 with two and those that go between 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.989
 interlacing to make the stitching 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.780
 at the bottom of the machine 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 sew is the quill holder and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 inside the quill and it will be in this quill 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 where we wind the thread to sew in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.980
 the bottom of the fabric we are going to 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 start at the bottom of the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 sewing machine will be the tap and the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.289
 We are going to take out the porta 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 canillas and from there we will take out the tap 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.550
 that we are going to slice 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.190
 now we 're going to the top and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.979
 we place the thread spool with which 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.979
 we are going to sew on the spool holder 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.990
 we hook the thread in one of the guides 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.150
 of thread that come in the machine in this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 specifically and from backwards forward and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 you see in the video 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.689
 now let's go through the wheel of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.480
 tension to slice the bobbin you have to 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.450
 give him this little round 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.300
 this screw they bring all the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.950
 machines and only serves for the winding 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.549
 of the quill 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.039
 next we are going to introduce the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.140
 thread in one of the holes of the 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.170
 tap and we will make a small 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.130
 knot so that it does not escape when rolling 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.340
 the thread in the tap we give a couple of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.439
 turns the center with I use it to 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.460
 that the thread is always inside the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.009
 stretcher and we are going to place the spigot 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.640
 so that the thread is in the part 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.970
 superior and looking to the left what 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.130
 we introduce in the pivot where we 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
 comes the drawing to slice the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.030
 quill 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.920
 you see that the tap is going to turn in the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.680
 clockwise that's why 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.590
 we put the thread on the top 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 we click and hold the thread a 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.630
 little while we step on the pedal so that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 the bobbin begins to fill with thread 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.210
 We will make this subject for 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.020
 that the thread between inside the stretcher 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.740
 once we finish we click and 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.380
 we take out the bobbin we split the thread and 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.900
 we will introduce in the tap holder but 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.719
 before I will give another method of threading 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 we start with the same step and put the 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.120
 thread in a little hole and make it a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.300
 small knot we give a small 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.470
 turns 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.080
 to the tap and with the thread up 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.170
 and looking to the left we're going to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.160
 insert the bobbin into the holder 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.670
 stretcher with the stretcher 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.460
 we click on it and now we go and give it 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.050
 the small return that we have previously 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:37.440
 given to the winding tensor we put the 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.330
 thread through the guide and place the coil 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.330
 of thread on the spool holder 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.670
 we will only have to step on the pedal 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.250
 the sewing machine so that it gets on 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.640
 operation and the tap is filled with 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.640
 thread 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.650
 when the bobbin is already full of thread 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.129
 let's move this bar that we have 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.310
 used to slice the same we cut 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.370
 the thread we take a tap and we're going to 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.239
 insert in the bobbin holder that goes in 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.239
 the bottom 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.099
 normally the thread is usually placed or 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.590
 in the direction of this slit or 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.350
 contrary 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.910
 if it is the opposite is because we want 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.910
 to exercise a little more attention 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.610
 let's repeat we introduce in the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.840
 tap on this tap holder that is 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.960
 boiling are usually almost all the same 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.550
 We insert the thread into the crack 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.710
 little girl that you are watching in the video 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.150
 once we have introduced it there 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.630
 let's move it to the tension tab 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.020
 of the lower thread and place it in the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.420
 half of the hole you see that you have to 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.230
 be with enough tension to 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.230
 that does not fall 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.879
 once finished let's go with the tab 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.860
 lifted from the bobbin case insert 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.729
 the tap on the bottom of the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.550
 machine with that small ledge towards 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.099
 up that is perfect in the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.160
 slit and we have to squeeze up 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.730
 click 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.090
 we leave the excess thread out of the holder 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.250
 tap and we'll finish this process with 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.350
 the threading of the next machine 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.660
