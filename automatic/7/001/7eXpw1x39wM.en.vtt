00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello to all we are to the contamines there 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.680
 it's going pretty well on this beautiful 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.330
 Sun 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.310
 we have a session that will take place on 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 on two three hours of time the goal 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.009
 being to move a little the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
 bodies the legs to be able 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.180
 to attack the next cups of the world 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.310
 in austria within ten days more 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 serenely and then with this period 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.840
 holidays it feels good a little bit of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 to have the athletes on hand for 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 to continue working with them with 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.220
 the cattle and one in one the team of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.750
 france today at the mulumba clash 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.200
 listen we have had good results 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 we made cuts in italy we have a 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.470
 beautiful fourth place that was taken 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.260
 by sylvain miaillier owen tax is 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.940
 beautiful 7th place also we have plenty who 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 must be this seventh world 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.329
 currently no after two steps so 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.040
 in girls and also we are not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.759
 Misplaced 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.770
 now I think we have a group 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.340
 who ask that for that to mount a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.429
 pure in power again and it will do 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 to make contingents necessary accounting 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.619
 firstly because I have a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 great attachment that contaminates by 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.840
 compared to his world cup and then that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.700
 been ten years that he plays well the du 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.609
 skicross me I go in more neighbor 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.720
 I am a hindrance 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:37.160
 we had opportunities through a 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.350
 track they were more than since top 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.660
 to host the France team so 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 it is I think a little return of 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.530
 things we can give them too 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.460
 to bring our best French athletes 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.540
 were training on these tracks did 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.580
 come a little better and loire 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.230
 tourism gives a show rate 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.790
 it gives life a little to the station then 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 then we are allowed to work it's 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.950
 super interesting class for all - 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.540
 charge the length ahead on your feet 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.350
 instead of going up in the air everything that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 removes in stop to do
