hi<00:00:05.220> guys<00:00:05.690> I've<00:00:06.690> been<00:00:07.259> pretty<00:00:07.529> bad<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:08.280> my

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi guys I've been pretty bad with my

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.890 
hi guys I've been pretty bad with my
video<00:00:09.600> making<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.470> my<00:00:11.309> vlogging<00:00:11.900> recently

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
video making and my vlogging recently

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.249 
video making and my vlogging recently
and<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:14.040> said<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:15.360> last<00:00:15.540> blog<00:00:15.719> post<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.110> I

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
and I said in my last blog post that I

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.220 
and I said in my last blog post that I
would<00:00:16.380> make<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> video<00:00:16.890> showing<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:18.230> projects

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
would make a video showing the projects

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.279 
would make a video showing the projects
that<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.410> made<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:20.270> scrap<00:00:21.270> materials<00:00:21.840> that's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that I made from scrap materials that's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.779 
that I made from scrap materials that's
left<00:00:22.560> over<00:00:22.740> from<00:00:22.859> other<00:00:23.070> projects<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.640> things

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
left over from other projects and things

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.410 
left over from other projects and things
like<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
like that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.259 
like that
and<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> thought<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.980> considering<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.090> have

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and so I thought that considering I have

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.910 
and so I thought that considering I have
fallen<00:00:27.539> off<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> face<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> planet<00:00:28.380> online

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
fallen off the face of the planet online

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.179 
fallen off the face of the planet online
wise<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.400> would<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:29.910> I've<00:00:30.000> been<00:00:30.090> making

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
wise I would show what I've been making

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
wise I would show what I've been making
generally<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.050> I've<00:00:34.140> not

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
generally and it's not that I've not

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.569 
generally and it's not that I've not
been<00:00:34.380> making<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> generally

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
been making I have and generally

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.360 
been making I have and generally
everything<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.440> made<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:37.950> form<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
everything is made out in some form of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.780 
everything is made out in some form of
recycled<00:00:39.030> materials<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:41.280> few<00:00:41.460> years<00:00:41.640> are

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
recycled materials and my few years are

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.389 
recycled materials and my few years are
getting<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.620> ridiculously<00:00:43.620> full<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
getting a bit ridiculously full with the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
getting a bit ridiculously full with the
amount<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:45.379> scrap<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.129> store<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.000> went

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
amount of scrap that I store and went

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.740 
amount of scrap that I store and went
throw<00:00:48.390> away<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> start<00:00:49.980> making

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
throw away so I have to start making

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
throw away so I have to start making
things<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> them<00:00:52.320> basically<00:00:52.950> so<00:00:53.460> I'll<00:00:53.550> put

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
things out of them basically so I'll put

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.100 
things out of them basically so I'll put
the<00:00:53.760> ones<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.239> made<00:00:54.390> generally

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the ones that are made generally

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
the ones that are made generally
entirely<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.030> scrap<00:00:57.030> materials<00:00:57.449> towards

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
entirely out of scrap materials towards

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.170 
entirely out of scrap materials towards
the<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.430> video<00:00:59.670> they've<00:00:59.969> still

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the end of see the video they've still

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.090 
the end of see the video they've still
got<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> judge<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.710> such

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
got things on them to judge them up such

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
got things on them to judge them up such
as<00:01:02.340> bling<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.680> buttons<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> things<00:01:05.009> like

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that but generally the foundations of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
that but generally the foundations of
them<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.100> made<00:01:08.250> almost<00:01:08.790> entirely<00:01:09.270> from

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them are made almost entirely from

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.310 
them are made almost entirely from
scraps<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> rest'll<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.750> say<00:01:12.990> some
