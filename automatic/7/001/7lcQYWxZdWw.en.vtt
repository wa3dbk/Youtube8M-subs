get<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.329> top<00:02:07.630> token<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.310> flip<00:02:09.610> it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
get the top token here and I flip it

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.490 
get the top token here and I flip it
over<00:02:09.880> secretly<00:02:10.569> that's<00:02:10.869> how<00:02:11.020> many<00:02:11.200> victory

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
over secretly that's how many victory

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.750 
over secretly that's how many victory
points<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.810> rest<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:15.160> case<00:02:15.430> are

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
points I have the rest in this case are

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.290 
points I have the rest in this case are
also<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.390> two<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.930> four<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> same

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
also a two and four and we do the same

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.110 
also a two and four and we do the same
thing<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.690> everybody<00:02:20.050> if<00:02:20.200> two<00:02:20.380> people<00:02:20.590> tie<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
thing for everybody if two people tie so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.160 
thing for everybody if two people tie so
let's<00:02:22.300> say<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.750> two

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
let's say I have two

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.890 
let's say I have two
sixes<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:24.160> player<00:02:24.459> has<00:02:24.700> two<00:02:24.880> sixes<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
sixes that player has two sixes that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.589 
sixes that player has two sixes that
player<00:02:26.200> has<00:02:26.380> one<00:02:26.740> six<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.819> eliminate<00:02:28.420> each

player has one six we eliminate each

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.440 
player has one six we eliminate each
other<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.110> these<00:02:29.200> two<00:02:29.440> tied<00:02:30.130> at<00:02:30.310> two<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.730> next

the most varied menu meaning you have
the<00:02:50.470> most<00:02:50.950> different<00:02:51.670> cards<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:52.989> get<00:02:53.290> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the most different cards then you get to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.979 
the most different cards then you get to
take<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.950> these<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.300> basic<00:02:55.750> game

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
take one of these that's the basic game

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.920 
take one of these that's the basic game
there<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.980> some<00:02:57.610> rules<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.120> an<00:02:58.180> advanced

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
there is a some rules for an advanced

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.130 
there is a some rules for an advanced
game<00:02:59.680> which<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.280> really<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.810> not<00:03:01.989> much

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
game which is really you know not much

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.770 
game which is really you know not much
more<00:03:02.440> difficult<00:03:03.040> than<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> basic<00:03:03.940> game<00:03:04.150> but

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
more difficult than the basic game but

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.330 
more difficult than the basic game but
basically<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.170> way<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.290> works<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.890> wild

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
basically the way that works is the wild

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.770 
basically the way that works is the wild
cards<00:03:06.640> at<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.880> point<00:03:07.120> what<00:03:07.239> only<00:03:07.450> counts<00:03:07.720> as

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
cards at that point what only counts as

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.710 
cards at that point what only counts as
half<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.440> card<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:09.040> scoring<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.670> some<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
half a card for scoring and some of the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.699 
half a card for scoring and some of the
cards<00:03:11.110> show<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.799> wasabi<00:03:12.459> symbol<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.620> let's<00:03:14.620> see

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
cards show a wasabi symbol and let's see

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.490 
cards show a wasabi symbol and let's see
if<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:14.890> can<00:03:15.040> find<00:03:15.400> one<00:03:15.730> here<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.930> wasabi

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
if we can find one here with the wasabi

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.259 
if we can find one here with the wasabi
in<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.970> corner<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:21.549> there<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.239> one

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
in the corner right there there is one

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.400 
in the corner right there there is one
has<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> little<00:03:23.410> wasabi<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.870> corner<00:03:26.230> there

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
has a little wasabi in the corner there

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.680 
has a little wasabi in the corner there
and<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.400> those<00:03:27.640> cards<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.060> have<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.329> wasabi

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
and so those cards I have the wasabi

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.560 
and so those cards I have the wasabi
symbol<00:03:29.260> any<00:03:29.620> sushi<00:03:30.280> type<00:03:30.670> collection<00:03:31.329> with<00:03:31.450> at

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
symbol any sushi type collection with at

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.140 
symbol any sushi type collection with at
least<00:03:31.690> one<00:03:31.989> wasabi<00:03:32.590> card<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.370> will<00:03:33.910> count

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
least one wasabi card in it will count

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.590 
least one wasabi card in it will count
this<00:03:34.359> half<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.109> type<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:36.190> scoring<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.390> it'll

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
this half a type for scoring so it'll

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.400 
this half a type for scoring so it'll
become<00:03:37.690> harder<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.250> dessert<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.750> again

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
become harder to get dessert so again

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.849 
become harder to get dessert so again
just<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.519> sake<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.180> type<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.570> card<00:03:44.109> if

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
just for the sake of the type of card if

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.580 
just for the sake of the type of card if
you<00:03:45.070> have<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.489> wasabi<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.540> counts<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:46.989> half<00:03:47.320> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
you have the wasabi it counts as half a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.550 
you have the wasabi it counts as half a
type<00:03:47.859> in<00:03:48.700> order<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:49.750> dessert<00:03:50.320> makes

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
type in order to get that dessert makes

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.860 
type in order to get that dessert makes
it<00:03:50.739> harder<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.250> get<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.790> dessert<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:52.720> that's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
it harder to get the dessert but that's

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.960 
it harder to get the dessert but that's
really<00:03:53.200> basically<00:03:53.680> at<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.040> game's<00:03:54.250> very

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
really basically at the game's very

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.580 
really basically at the game's very
simple<00:03:55.420> as<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.540> can<00:03:55.630> see<00:03:56.019> even<00:03:56.230> with<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
simple as you can see even with the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.090 
simple as you can see even with the
advanced<00:03:56.950> variants<00:03:57.519> play<00:03:58.390> three<00:03:58.900> rounds<00:03:59.109> try

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
advanced variants play three rounds try

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.979 
advanced variants play three rounds try
to<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.489> most<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.970> each<00:04:01.060> kind<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.630> score

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
game especially if you leave out the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.100 
game especially if you leave out the
weird<00:04:41.640> complicated<00:04:42.180> stuff<00:04:42.360> about<00:04:42.600> scoring

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
weird complicated stuff about scoring

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.260

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
half carts and such which is fine it's

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270 
half carts and such which is fine it's
really<00:04:45.480> not<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.750> hard<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.020> figure<00:04:46.230> out<00:04:46.530> but

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
really not that hard to figure out but

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.720 
really not that hard to figure out but
if<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:47.850> want<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.590> super<00:04:49.590> easy<00:04:49.980> stick

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
if you want it to be super easy stick

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.520 
if you want it to be super easy stick

cute quick little philic place three to
five<00:04:57.810> which<00:04:58.050> is<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.170> good<00:04:58.590> amount<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.890> place

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
five which is a good amount of place

five which is a good amount of place
about<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.550> same<00:04:59.760> with<00:04:59.910> everybody<00:05:00.240> because<00:05:00.480> at

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
about the same with everybody because at

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.060 
about the same with everybody because at
the<00:05:00.720> drafting<00:05:01.140> game<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.620> goes<00:05:01.800> up<00:05:01.920> about

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
the drafting game so it goes up about

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.750 
the drafting game so it goes up about
the<00:05:02.220> same<00:05:02.400> speed<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:03.800> like<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:05.010> artwork<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:05.610> like

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
the same speed I like the artwork I like

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.340 
the same speed I like the artwork I like
the<00:05:05.880> construction<00:05:06.510> of<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> game<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.080> think<00:05:07.260> the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
the construction of the game I think the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.960 
the construction of the game I think the
tin<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.680> actually<00:05:07.980> really<00:05:08.340> nice<00:05:08.550> for<00:05:08.850> this

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
tin is actually really nice for this

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.900 
tin is actually really nice for this
game<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.450> works<00:05:09.690> really<00:05:09.930> well<00:05:10.250> in<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.550> holding

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910

all the bits together it's a nice little

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.560 
all the bits together it's a nice little
