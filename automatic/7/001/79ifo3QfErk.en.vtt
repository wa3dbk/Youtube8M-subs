 respect for love to change a weapon for the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.550
 opportunity to be better Venezuelans 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.220
 for the opportunity to have a job 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.390

 minister around you just said

 but more retaliation some intention is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 precisely that they add that they deliver 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.719
 a weapon and with that weapon change a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.209
 destination of obstacle of persecution of 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.030
 anguish for a destiny of peace of 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.370
 tolerance and love 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.260
