00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
what kind of interesting doing and I get

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.389 
what kind of interesting doing and I get
getting<00:01:27.060> many<00:01:27.300> ideas<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:28.080> Korea<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:29.039> come<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
getting many ideas from Korea to come in

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.540 
getting many ideas from Korea to come in
here<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:31.170> course<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.800> really<00:01:31.830> same

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
here and of course it's not really same

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.230 
here and of course it's not really same
but<00:01:32.910> I<00:01:33.119> tried<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> creating<00:01:34.319> more<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:36.149> are

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
but I tried to creating more like we are

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.030 
but I tried to creating more like we are
feeling

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.860 

the<00:01:43.400> killing<00:01:43.700> BIA<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:43.940> think<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.480> can<00:01:44.690> measure

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
the killing BIA I think I can measure

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.810 
the killing BIA I think I can measure
with<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.290> bein<00:01:46.360> Korean<00:01:47.360> pancake<00:01:47.890> which<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.130> Ho

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
with a bein Korean pancake which is Ho

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.540 
with a bein Korean pancake which is Ho
Chi<00:01:50.060> Minh<00:01:50.390> Japan<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.080> think<00:01:51.110> my<00:01:51.500> popular<00:01:51.920> it's

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
Chi Minh Japan I think my popular it's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.300 
Chi Minh Japan I think my popular it's
quite<00:01:52.790> good<00:01:52.820> like<00:01:53.500> pictures<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
quite good like pictures with the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.760 
quite good like pictures with the
killing<00:01:55.580> beers<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.630> probably<00:01:57.410> one<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
killing beers so probably one of the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.350 
killing beers so probably one of the
Lacombe<00:01:58.040> in<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.220> tissues<00:01:58.550> without<00:01:58.820> um<00:01:59.180> beer

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
Lacombe in the tissues without um beer

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.140 
Lacombe in the tissues without um beer
and<00:01:59.720> also<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.590> have<00:02:00.980> our<00:02:01.130> lockers<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.580> spicy

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
and also I have our lockers on spicy

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.270 
and also I have our lockers on spicy
squid<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.520> spicy<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.990> think<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.070> game

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
squid it is spicy but I think the game

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.810 
squid it is spicy but I think the game
will<00:02:07.430> chop<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.940> spiciness<00:02:08.480> and<00:02:08.980> also<00:02:09.980> kind<00:02:10.730> of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
will chop the spiciness and also kind of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.990 
will chop the spiciness and also kind of
strong<00:02:11.150> case<00:02:12.050> itself<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.520> quite<00:02:13.760> good

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
strong case itself so this quite good

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.430 
strong case itself so this quite good
