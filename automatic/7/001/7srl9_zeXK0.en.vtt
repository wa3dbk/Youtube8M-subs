00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
everywhere oh this is very similar if

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:19.340 
everywhere oh this is very similar if
like<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.320> smells<00:03:05.590> wonderful<00:03:14.640> glorious

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.440 

beautiful<00:03:20.350> milk<00:03:20.560> chocolate<00:03:21.120> hmm<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:25.180> very

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
beautiful milk chocolate hmm it's very

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.920 
beautiful milk chocolate hmm it's very
similar<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> Cadbury<00:03:28.000> flake<00:03:28.330> look<00:03:28.570> coats

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
similar to a Cadbury flake look coats

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.949 
similar to a Cadbury flake look coats
the<00:03:29.110> roof<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.410> mouth<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:31.420> it's<00:03:31.570> actually

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
the roof you mouth but it's actually

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.960 
the roof you mouth but it's actually
creamier<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.370> didn't<00:03:33.610> think<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.880> was

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
creamier and I didn't think that was

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.360 
creamier and I didn't think that was
possible<00:03:34.209> because<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:35.530> milk<00:03:35.830> chocolate<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
possible because the milk chocolate in a

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.550 
possible because the milk chocolate in a
flake<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.910> actually<00:03:37.300> very<00:03:37.510> creamy<00:03:37.900> already<00:03:38.260> so

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
flake is actually very creamy already so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.140 
flake is actually very creamy already so
that's<00:03:39.459> wonderful<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.250> flake<00:03:42.520> as<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.730> say<00:03:42.970> it's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
that's wonderful the flake as I say it's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.850 
that's wonderful the flake as I say it's
like<00:03:43.300> very<00:03:43.480> thin<00:03:43.840> layers<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.260> chocolate<00:03:44.560> it's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
like very thin layers of chocolate it's

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.770 
like very thin layers of chocolate it's
been<00:03:44.980> sort<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:45.550> folded<00:03:45.910> over<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.330> top<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.570> each

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
been sort of folded over on top of each

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.040 
been sort of folded over on top of each
other<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.110> that's<00:03:47.260> exactly<00:03:47.500> what<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.160> so

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
other and that's exactly what this is so

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.690 
other and that's exactly what this is so
I've<00:03:50.050> shown<00:03:50.770> that<00:03:50.800> up<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.190> camera<00:03:51.459> you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.020 
I've shown that up to the camera you
might<00:03:51.820> get<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.050> slight<00:03:53.050> idea<00:03:53.700> see<00:03:54.700> how<00:03:54.880> it's

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
might get a slight idea see how it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.270 
might get a slight idea see how it's
just<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.450> one<00:03:55.750> layer<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.740> chocolate<00:03:57.010> after

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
just like one layer of chocolate after

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.430

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
another it's all folded on top of each

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.330 
another it's all folded on top of each
other<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:01.209> very<00:04:01.360> light<00:04:01.750> but<00:04:02.340> absolutely

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350
