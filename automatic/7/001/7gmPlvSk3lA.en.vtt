00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
and the tip of the further and it's very

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.940 
and the tip of the further and it's very
much<00:01:32.840> easier<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.290> actually<00:01:33.440> wet<00:01:33.740> these

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.570 
bit of varnish on them just to give a
bit<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.870> extra<00:04:11.140> strength<00:04:11.290> from<00:04:11.500> them<00:04:11.650> after<00:04:12.400> a

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
bit of extra strength from them after a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.190 
bit of extra strength from them after a
millimeter<00:04:12.940> or<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.270> just<00:04:13.570> behind<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.170> eye

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
millimeter or so just behind the eye

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.260 
millimeter or so just behind the eye
then<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.220> actually<00:04:15.430> create<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.790> wings<00:04:15.970> here

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
then to actually create the wings here

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:26.670 
then to actually create the wings here
