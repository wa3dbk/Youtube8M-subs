00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
diagnosis this is also a disease where

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.849 
diagnosis this is also a disease where
we<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.640> chemotherapy<00:01:54.060> options<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.649> we

we have some chemotherapy options but we

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
are sorely in need of better options and

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.919 
are sorely in need of better options and
I<00:01:59.009> tell<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.729> patients<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
I tell my patients that this is a

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.559 
I tell my patients that this is a
disease<00:02:01.380> where<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.069> clinical<00:02:02.939> trial<00:02:03.179> really

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
disease where a clinical trial really

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.679 
disease where a clinical trial really
makes<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.079> lot<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> sense<00:02:05.359> clinical<00:02:06.359> trials

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.830 
makes a lot of sense clinical trials
