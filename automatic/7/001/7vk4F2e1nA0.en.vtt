in<00:06:36.440> a<00:06:36.680> way<00:06:36.830> of<00:06:37.010> step<00:06:37.310> back<00:06:37.520> with<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:38.120> firm<00:06:39.110> and

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
in a way of step back with the firm and

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.030 
in a way of step back with the firm and
sinfulness<00:06:40.750> the<00:06:41.750> Eroica<00:06:42.260> is<00:06:42.620> really<00:06:43.340> a<00:06:43.810> corner

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040
