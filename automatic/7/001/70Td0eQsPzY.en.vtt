of<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.760> cuff<00:00:53.000> okay<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:53.690> think<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.140> done<00:00:54.320> about

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
of the cuff okay I think it's done about

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.800 
of the cuff okay I think it's done about
every<00:00:54.740> five<00:00:54.980> millimeters<00:00:55.550> or<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.120> that

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
every five millimeters or so and that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.870 
every five millimeters or so and that
allows<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.890> make<00:00:58.220> sure<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.730> in

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
allows you to make sure that in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.820 
allows you to make sure that in
reference<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.390> your<00:00:59.450> top<00:00:59.690> triple<00:01:00.170> tree<00:01:00.380> you

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
reference to your top triple tree you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.850 
reference to your top triple tree you
can<00:01:01.010> have<00:01:01.190> both<00:01:01.550> sides<00:01:02.030> set<00:01:02.540> exactly<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.590> same

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
can have both sides set exactly the same

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.850 
can have both sides set exactly the same
in<00:01:04.040> terms<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:05.229> rotation<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.650> cuff

now we're going to need to loosen the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.340 
now we're going to need to loosen the

you're going to have to take the

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.640 
you're going to have to take the
throttle<00:02:13.090> apart<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:14.170> there's<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.590> going

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
throttle apart because there's not going

ok I've got the entire plug side taken

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.020 
ok I've got the entire plug side taken
apart<00:02:23.769> now<00:02:23.950> -<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.550> said<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.879> one's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
apart now - like I said that one's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.809 
apart now - like I said that one's
really<00:02:25.299> relatively<00:02:26.250> self-explanatory

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819

has<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.459> kit<00:02:36.730> harness<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.660> there<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.930> no

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
has a kit harness so there is no

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.900 
has a kit harness so there is no
ignition<00:02:38.769> cylinder<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.280> makes<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.819> little

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
ignition cylinder here makes it a little

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.190 
ignition cylinder here makes it a little
bit<00:02:40.060> easier<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.510> may<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.989> deal<00:02:41.140> with

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
hand controls going to be spot on if I

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.990 
hand controls going to be spot on if I
want<00:06:45.530> to<00:06:45.590> tweak<00:06:45.800> them<00:06:45.979> I<00:06:46.160> can<00:06:46.699> move<00:06:46.849> them

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
want to tweak them I can move them

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.540 
want to tweak them I can move them
around<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.389> little<00:06:47.419> bit<00:06:47.690> and<00:06:48.069> both<00:06:49.069> sides<00:06:49.400> would

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
around a little bit and both sides would

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.400 
around a little bit and both sides would
be<00:06:49.610> dead<00:06:49.880> even<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.630> other<00:06:50.750> thing<00:06:50.960> is<00:06:51.110> let's<00:06:51.289> be

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
be dead even the other thing is let's be

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.520 
be dead even the other thing is let's be
realistic<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:52.099> Josh<00:06:52.310> kind<00:06:52.610> of<00:06:52.669> get<00:06:52.789> a<00:06:52.819> nice
