 minimum has reached the maximum it has been operating 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.190
 and half if it is below the minimum is 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.590

 fuel bill is marking 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.410
 right, the temperature pointer is 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.260
 Okay, so this is the tip stay tuned. 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.600
 Anything for the vehicle
