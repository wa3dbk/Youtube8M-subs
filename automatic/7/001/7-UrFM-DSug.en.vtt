00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
edges and and things that you don't

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
lot of that's really this so well over

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.530 
lot of that's really this so well over
the<00:01:59.670> two-year<00:01:59.820> period

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.630 
the two-year period
I<00:02:00.570> said<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.799> improvised<00:02:02.189> Neeson
