building a bit more and boom you can fit

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
building a bit more and boom you can fit

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a pretty sweet try oh tech dark right in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
a pretty sweet try oh tech dark right in
there<00:01:46.350> Kings<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.009> could<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> try<00:01:47.939> Oh<00:01:47.970> tech

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
there Kings on could use a try Oh tech

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
there Kings on could use a try Oh tech
dark<00:01:48.540> ride<00:01:48.720> that'd<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> good<00:01:49.409> fit<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
dark ride that'd be a good fit for the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
dark ride that'd be a good fit for the
park<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.880> year<00:01:51.090> after<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> think

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
park and the year after that I think

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.510 
park and the year after that I think
that<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.200> should<00:01:52.229> add<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.770> thrilling<00:01:53.189> flat

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that they should add a thrilling flat

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
that they should add a thrilling flat
ride<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.450> said<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> last<00:01:54.899> time<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> they

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
ride like I said the last time I they

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.800 
ride like I said the last time I they
added<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> thrilling<00:01:56.040> fly<00:01:56.340> ride<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.880> 2011

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
added a thrilling fly ride was in 2011

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
added a thrilling fly ride was in 2011
so<00:01:58.140> something<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.560> an<00:01:58.860> S&amp;S<00:01:59.219> screamin<00:01:59.670> swing

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so something like an S&amp;S screamin swing

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
so something like an S&amp;S screamin swing
would<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> great<00:02:00.659> fit<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.439> doesn't<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
would be a great fit it doesn't have to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.039 
would be a great fit it doesn't have to
be<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.850> flat<00:02:03.180> rides<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.630> showed<00:02:03.899> in

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
be one of the two flat rides I showed in

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
be one of the two flat rides I showed in
those<00:02:04.170> pictures<00:02:04.409> those<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.280> two

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
those pictures those are just two

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
those pictures those are just two
examples<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:06.149> some<00:02:06.329> flat<00:02:06.540> rides<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.020> they

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
examples of some flat rides that they

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
examples of some flat rides that they
could<00:02:07.350> potentially<00:02:07.890> add<00:02:08.039> my<00:02:08.489> only<00:02:08.700> worry<00:02:08.910> with

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
could potentially add my only worry with

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.880 
could potentially add my only worry with
adding<00:02:09.390> an<00:02:09.479> S<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.750> Escrima<00:02:10.140> swing<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
adding an S an Escrima swing is that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
adding an S an Escrima swing is that
Skyhawk<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.819> Cedar<00:02:12.120> Point<00:02:12.480> has<00:02:12.690> been<00:02:12.720> received

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
Skyhawk at Cedar Point has been received

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920 
Skyhawk at Cedar Point has been received
lots<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.250> problems<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.780> they're

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
lots of problems so because they're

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.930 
lots of problems so because they're
having<00:02:16.020> some<00:02:16.320> issues<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:16.770> Skyhawk<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.700> think

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
having some issues with Skyhawk I think

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
having some issues with Skyhawk I think
that<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.240> might<00:02:18.510> lower<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.320> possibility<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that that might lower the possibility of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.550 
that that might lower the possibility of
Kings<00:02:20.520> Island<00:02:20.760> adding<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.450> however<00:02:22.020> if<00:02:22.380> they

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
Kings Island adding one however if they

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.260 
Kings Island adding one however if they
did<00:02:22.770> choose<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.520> route<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.910> would<00:02:24.120> be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
did choose to go that route it would be

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.720 
did choose to go that route it would be
a<00:02:24.300> great<00:02:24.600> fit<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.530> 2018<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.580> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
a great fit and in 2018 I think that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
a great fit and in 2018 I think that
that<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.180> when<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:27.570> should<00:02:27.750> add<00:02:27.930> their<00:02:28.200> next

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
that is when they should add their next

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
that is when they should add their next
rollercoaster<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:29.910> happen<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.210> years

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
rollercoaster that will happen for years

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.480 
rollercoaster that will happen for years
since<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.290> Banshee<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.160> they<00:02:32.310> could

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
since the Banshee and what they could

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.630 
since the Banshee and what they could
use<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> great<00:02:33.720> GCI<00:02:34.320> woody<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.490> where

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
use is a great GCI woody as for where

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
use is a great GCI woody as for where
they<00:02:35.760> could<00:02:35.970> put<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.570> have<00:02:36.690> attached<00:02:37.020> an

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
pretty good bargain for toy 19 I think

should consider putting these two in and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.030 
should consider putting these two in and
finally<00:03:36.720> for<00:03:36.930> 2020<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.920> they

finally for 2020 I think that they

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.500 
finally for 2020 I think that they
should<00:03:38.250> focus<00:03:38.489> their<00:03:38.730> attention<00:03:39.300> back<00:03:39.450> to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
should focus their attention back to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.960 
should focus their attention back to

those capsules slides in which the floor
drops<00:03:44.040> beneath<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.700> could<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.330> them<00:03:45.510> going

Dominion<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:54.209> 2015<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.959> very<00:03:55.470> well<00:03:55.650> could<00:03:55.709> see

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
Dominion for 2015 I very well could see

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.590 
Dominion for 2015 I very well could see
them<00:03:56.220> going<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.640> route<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.300> I've<00:03:57.390> also

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
them going that route and I've also

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.880 
them going that route and I've also
attached<00:03:57.959> an<00:03:58.080> image<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.530> Google<00:03:58.860> Earth

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
attached an image of Google Earth

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.530 
attached an image of Google Earth
showing<00:03:59.220> where<00:03:59.489> they<00:03:59.610> could<00:03:59.790> potentially<00:04:00.120> put

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
showing where they could potentially put

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.810 
showing where they could potentially put
I<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:00.870> two<00:04:01.110> potential<00:04:01.739> spots<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.340> complex

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
I see two potential spots for a complex

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.670 
I see two potential spots for a complex
like<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.510> think<00:04:03.959> either<00:04:04.110> one<00:04:04.410> would<00:04:04.620> work

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
like that I think either one would work

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.540 
like that I think either one would work
just<00:04:05.130> fine

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
just fine

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.759 
just fine
so<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.360> recap<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.110> how<00:04:07.380> Kings

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
so just to recap this is how Kings

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.729 
so just to recap this is how Kings
Islands<00:04:08.220> next<00:04:08.519> five<00:04:08.820> years<00:04:09.150> might<00:04:09.420> look<00:04:09.630> like

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
Islands next five years might look like

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.229 
Islands next five years might look like
again<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:11.250> speculation

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
again this is just speculation

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.930 
again this is just speculation
what<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.720> think<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.320> possibilities<00:04:14.070> are<00:04:14.100> right

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
what I think the possibilities are right

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.210 
what I think the possibilities are right
now<00:04:15.120> no<00:04:15.450> new<00:04:15.690> information<00:04:16.080> has<00:04:16.650> been<00:04:16.859> leaked

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
now no new information has been leaked

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.940 
now no new information has been leaked
by<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.549> park<00:04:17.970> no<00:04:18.299> hints<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.930> been<00:04:19.080> given<00:04:19.470> so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
by the park no hints have been given so

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.740 
by the park no hints have been given so
all<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.700> just<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.269> out<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> limb

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
all of this is just going out on a limb

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.529 
all of this is just going out on a limb
looking<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.710> what<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.130> park<00:04:23.370> needs<00:04:23.669> where

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
looking at what the park needs where

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.330 
looking at what the park needs where
they<00:04:24.570> could<00:04:24.900> put<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.560> when<00:04:26.010> they<00:04:26.160> could

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
they could put it and when they could

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.970 
they could put it and when they could
potentially

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
potentially

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.680 
potentially
at<00:04:27.040> it<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.520> very<00:04:27.760> possible<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.240> when<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
at it it's very possible that when the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.840 
at it it's very possible that when the
summer<00:04:28.990> starts<00:04:29.470> things<00:04:29.740> will<00:04:29.920> change<00:04:29.950> hints

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
summer starts things will change hints

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.910 
summer starts things will change hints
will<00:04:31.060> be<00:04:31.180> dropped<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.410> will<00:04:32.560> lead<00:04:32.740> us

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
will be dropped and then it will lead us

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.350 
will be dropped and then it will lead us
to<00:04:33.100> think<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.550> something<00:04:33.880> else<00:04:34.000> will<00:04:34.240> be

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
to think that something else will be

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.320 
to think that something else will be
coming<00:04:34.630> for<00:04:34.810> 2016<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.620> then<00:04:35.770> for<00:04:35.950> 2017<00:04:36.670> if<00:04:36.880> you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
coming for 2016 and then for 2017 if you

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.760 
coming for 2016 and then for 2017 if you
think<00:04:37.540> about<00:04:37.600> five<00:04:37.900> years<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.410> long<00:04:38.710> time

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
think about five years is a long time

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.500 
think about five years is a long time
it's<00:04:39.280> very<00:04:39.460> likely<00:04:39.760> that<00:04:40.090> things<00:04:40.270> will<00:04:40.480> change

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
it's very likely that things will change

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.260 
it's very likely that things will change
a<00:04:41.110> new<00:04:41.470> ride<00:04:41.800> type<00:04:42.160> will<00:04:42.400> be<00:04:42.430> unveiled

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
a new ride type will be unveiled

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.510 
a new ride type will be unveiled
then<00:04:43.480> parks<00:04:43.900> will<00:04:44.050> be<00:04:44.080> adding<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.070> 5-year

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
then parks will be adding it so 5-year

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.610 
then parks will be adding it so 5-year
plans<00:04:45.880> are<00:04:46.150> hard<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.660> predict<00:04:47.110> especially

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
plans are hard to predict especially

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.560 
plans are hard to predict especially
when<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.100> video<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.550> being<00:04:48.700> released<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.180> 2015
