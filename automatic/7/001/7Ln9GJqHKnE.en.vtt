so so got that dirty picked this idea
because<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.250> don't<00:05:27.460> need<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.610> long<00:05:27.940> as<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.090> have<00:05:28.210> I

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
because I don't need it long as I have I

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.700 
because I don't need it long as I have I
am<00:05:28.360> Esther<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:28.930> I'm<00:05:29.020> gonna<00:05:29.140> try<00:05:29.350> to<00:05:29.410> get<00:05:29.560> this

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
am Esther so I'm gonna try to get this

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.830 
am Esther so I'm gonna try to get this
at<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.890> angle<00:05:30.490> over<00:05:30.850> here<00:05:30.970> in<00:05:31.270> case<00:05:31.450> they<00:05:31.600> try<00:05:31.660> to

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
at a angle over here in case they try to

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.110 
at a angle over here in case they try to
sneak<00:05:32.110> up<00:05:32.230> to<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:32.440> side<00:05:32.710> now<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.730> only<00:05:33.970> thing

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
sneak up to the side now the only thing

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.760 
sneak up to the side now the only thing
is<00:05:34.240> I'm<00:05:34.420> finding<00:05:34.570> with<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.930> sentry<00:05:35.320> gun<00:05:35.350> and

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
is I'm finding with the sentry gun and

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.010 
is I'm finding with the sentry gun and
this<00:05:36.130> location<00:05:36.730> they<00:05:36.820> can<00:05:36.850> actually<00:05:37.270> crawl<00:05:37.840> up

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
this location they can actually crawl up

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.210 
this location they can actually crawl up
the<00:05:38.140> steps<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.470> then<00:05:38.560> shoot<00:05:38.800> into<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.010> room

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
the steps and then shoot into the room

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.100 
the steps and then shoot into the room
real<00:05:39.400> quick<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:40.180> gotta<00:05:40.360> find<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.750> perfect

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
real quick so I gotta find a perfect

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.920 
real quick so I gotta find a perfect
placement<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.830> I'd<00:05:42.430> be<00:05:42.580> too<00:05:42.760> close<00:05:42.970> up<00:05:43.210> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
placement and I'd be too close up and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.260 
placement and I'd be too close up and
this<00:05:44.440> may<00:05:44.650> not<00:05:44.890> be<00:05:44.950> far<00:05:45.400> enough<00:05:45.640> back<00:05:45.850> I'm<00:05:46.060> not

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
this may not be far enough back I'm not

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.909 
this may not be far enough back I'm not
sure<00:05:46.480> I<00:05:46.510> probably<00:05:46.840> should<00:05:47.110> have<00:05:47.200> dropped<00:05:47.410> ie<00:05:47.650> D

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
sure I probably should have dropped ie D

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.250 
sure I probably should have dropped ie D
right<00:05:48.460> there<00:05:48.610> too<00:05:48.730> though<00:05:48.880> my<00:05:49.810> left<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.169> the

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
right there too though my left of the

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.500 
right there too though my left of the
steps<00:05:50.669> look<00:05:51.669> at<00:05:51.790> it<00:05:51.880> or<00:05:51.970> assume<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.360> people

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
steps look at it or assume that people

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.280 
steps look at it or assume that people
look<00:05:52.750> at<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:52.930> idiot
