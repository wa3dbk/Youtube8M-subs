00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:16.099
 This is how Mercedes Benz sees the future and presents the Concept Car F015 here at CES. 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:22.430
 A really interesting study, which shows a completely new room concept from the inside. 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.420
 A long wheelbase and if you look at it all, it reminds you 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.770
 pretty much back to the future. 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 But, as I said, this is already a reality, at least as a concept. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.270
 She does not have much to do with a luxury sedan today. 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 Already the design of the 5.22 meter long, over two meters wide and 1.53 meters high Dickschiffs 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.340
 is a challenge to the traditionalists. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.150
 Because from the chic as well as status-conscious notchback becomes a monolith, like a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.070
 Van from the wind tunnel blows up all the usual ideas. 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.420
 It gets really exciting, however, when the opposing saloon doors open 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.110
 and release the view into the interior. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.850
 This is not just monstrous with an insane 3.60 meters wheelbase and a level floor 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 spacious and luxurious like a lounge in a five-star hotel. 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.170
 But above all, it surprises with its unique seating and operating concept. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.079
 The inmates are swiveled by four elegant lounge chairs, the first one 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.749
 Row are actually rotatably mounted. 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:31.439
 Here you have the opportunity to work, to relax, having fun together with friends 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.700
 and to get from A to B at the same time. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.399
 Or just having fun and driving the car and the technology that makes it possible 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.069
 is shown here in a previously non-existent form. 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.909
 The only piece of furniture next to the four armchairs is a futuristic conference table, 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630
 which builds on command between the inmates. 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.880
 You can surf, play or work on your digital worktop. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 Also everywhere in the doors and on the back wall one looks at displays. 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.149
 Animated flying particles give a subconscious insight into the speed, man 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.619
 Can specifically look at media content or look over the shoulder of the autopilot. 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.060
 As soon as you reach out, eyetracking and sensors appear on each one 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 appropriate location virtual controls. 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.569
 But at the latest when the driver turns into his old familiar position, he will be back 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.700
 grounded. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.739
 Because, after more than 125 years of automobiles, it just belongs to something, that's what it has 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.129
 the F 015 still a steering wheel and out of the ground protrude two pedals. 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.070
 While outside, the LED lighting on the stern and grill from the spacey blue into a familiar one 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.849
 White changes, so that man can take the helm from the machine at any time. 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.910
 Oh, I think in 2020, much of it will be feasible. 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.230
 Driving autonomously on the highway, to let the vehicle park automatically without a driver. 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.549
 Now, of course, we are going a bit further with this vision and we also want to show 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:11.159
 In 2030 in a lounge atmosphere you can leave the car completely self-sufficient for 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.599
 let go for a long time and then relax in a relaxed atmosphere, concentrate on 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.709
 Discussing work or with each other. 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.950
 We give back time, space and the opportunity to communicate. 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.299
 And this social discussion gives the automobile a completely different one for the future 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.299
 Meaning. 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.510
 The car of the future has a huge opportunity, I think! 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.439
 A design like space exploration, an interior like a mixture of luxury lounge 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.519
 and digital gambling den and a radically simplified operating system - are against it 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.640
 Drive and structure of the study almost conventional. 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.700
 Because that with a mixed construction of carbon, plastic, aluminum and steel the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.069
 Weight of the body shell can push 40 percent is not a big surprise. 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.900
 Although Mercedes, of course, would not be Mercedes, if the Swabians not one 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.189
 would have packed on it. 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.591
 After all, because the F 015 is a luxury car, it needs two electric motors 

00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:19.810
 together 272 hp, which balance him in 6.7 seconds to 100 and at least 200 things 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.810
 allow. 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.380
 And because the inmates enjoy the luxury offered on long-haul routes 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.600
 the fuel cell with the hydrogen from the carbon tanks 900 kilometers. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.260
 In view of the thin filling station network, the engineers also have to be on the safe side 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.540
 installed a plug-in battery for another 200 kilometers.
