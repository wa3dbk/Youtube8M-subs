 I saw two tablespoons of jens grains 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.679
 That gives to this typical minced meat 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.330
 aroma in the soy tip practically that 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.759

 along with the mustard seeds always 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.970
 then arrives, I give my all 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.000
 This is followed by 300 400 milliliters 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.410
 passed tomatoes i do that 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 a bit of feeling or some water 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 so that the consistency is right in the end 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 and then we come to the spices two 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.709

 That's what salt and pepper are all about 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.160
 Then follow 1 teaspoon of agave 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.269
 dexter on the taste and that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.519
 whole is mixed again and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.470
 first set aside and in the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.120
 the rest of the time you can go to just that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.069
