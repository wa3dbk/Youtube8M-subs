will be 161 provable unique potions and
there's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> change<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.760> add<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
there's a change that they might add to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
there's a change that they might add to
it<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.960> increase<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.710> number

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it that would increase that number

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
it that would increase that number
through<00:01:00.680> 2653<00:01:01.680> different<00:01:02.550> combinations<00:01:03.359> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
through 2653 different combinations I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
through 2653 different combinations I'm
presuming<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.189> they'll

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
presuming that will be because they'll

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
presuming that will be because they'll
be<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.880> certain<00:01:06.270> number<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.750> specific<00:01:07.380> effects

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
be a certain number or specific effects

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
be a certain number or specific effects
but<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.549> you'll<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> able<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.270> brew<00:01:09.570> them

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
but then you'll be able to brew them

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
but then you'll be able to brew them
with<00:01:10.140> different<00:01:10.380> strengths<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> different

with different strengths and different

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 
with different strengths and different
lengths<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.860> last<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
lengths of time that they last for and
