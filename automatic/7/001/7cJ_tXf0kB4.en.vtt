00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.700 
I think after our third or fourth phone
conversation<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.220> was<00:01:16.700> four<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.840> six<00:01:18.320> hours

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
long that has continued even now I mean

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.190 
long that has continued even now I mean
if<00:01:21.830> we're<00:01:22.040> not<00:01:22.160> in<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.430> same<00:01:22.670> city<00:01:23.000> or<00:01:23.450> he's

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
if we're not in the same city or he's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.690 
if we're not in the same city or he's
away<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.530> mean<00:01:24.800> we<00:01:24.950> can<00:01:25.070> talk<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.400> phone<00:01:25.430> for
