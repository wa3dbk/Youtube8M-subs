00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.899 
I tell Bill one day I said you know I
don't<00:00:58.589> think<00:00:58.860> we'll<00:00:59.250> ever<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> able<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> pay

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
don't think we'll ever be able to pay

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.149 
don't think we'll ever be able to pay
for<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.210> ranch<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:01.470> we<00:01:01.589> have<00:01:01.769> any<00:01:01.949> children

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
for this ranch if we have any children

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.719 
for this ranch if we have any children
educate<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.680> off<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.040> country<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
educate them off for this country I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
educate them off for this country I
think<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.479> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.870> into<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> purebred

think we need to go into the purebred

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.700 
think we need to go into the purebred
business<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.479> sell<00:01:09.479> Angus<00:01:10.020> bulls<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.590> these

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
business and sell Angus bulls to these

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210 
business and sell Angus bulls to these
commercial<00:01:11.250> Hereford<00:01:11.610> breeders<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:13.220> guess

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
commercial Hereford breeders I guess

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
for 68 years now and so those old cows

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
for 68 years now and so those old cows
have<00:01:22.110> been<00:01:22.229> awfully<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> us<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.810> that's

have been awfully good to us and that's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
have been awfully good to us and that's
what<00:01:25.049> keeps<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> cattle

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
what keeps you going in the cattle

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
what keeps you going in the cattle
business<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.899> looking<00:01:27.899> forward<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> next

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
business is looking forward to the next

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.569 
business is looking forward to the next
calf<00:01:28.920> crop<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> never<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> rancher

really retire and I think that says

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
really retire and I think that says
something<00:01:35.240> when<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.929> somebody<00:01:37.619> says<00:01:37.829> I
