00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
why I would have to choose giraffes
I<00:01:42.689> love<00:01:43.049> giraffes<00:01:43.350> every<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.399> them

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I love giraffes every time I see them

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
I love giraffes every time I see them
they<00:01:44.789> just<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.329> me<00:01:45.570> giddy<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> don't

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
they just they make me giddy and I don't

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.840 
they just they make me giddy and I don't
know<00:01:46.320> why<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.860> I've<00:01:47.039> liked<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> drafts<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
know why but I've liked the drafts of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:02:17.210 
know why but I've liked the drafts of
always<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.360> favorite<00:01:48.659> animals

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.620 

some<00:02:18.220> will<00:02:18.490> write<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.240> off<00:02:19.540> before<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.350> ever

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.470 

I<00:02:37.320> think<00:02:38.320> seeing<00:02:38.590> bears<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.250> really<00:02:39.520> put

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.100 
I think seeing bears would really put
people<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.230> mindset<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.840> loving<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110
