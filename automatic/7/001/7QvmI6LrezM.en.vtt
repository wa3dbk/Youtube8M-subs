00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 yes people today we change the paddock 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.140
 rod or popularly star the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 called or stabilizer which looks like this 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800
 out 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.440
 they like to suggest they are there 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 the front axle and at the rear axle 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.119
 and today we are doing it by example 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.350
 The 46 offers the vehicle if you can 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.730
 system has understood one like it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 That actually works quite simply 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 are only two screws then you can 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 apply this to every vehicle as well 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.080
 and first and foremost a dry vehicle 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:46.260
 open a bit and do it 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:48.300
 under yes so the coupling rod sits 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 now here once moored on 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 Shock absorbers up here and then go here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.710
 down on the stabilizer itself that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:12.000
 are in principle only two screws and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 we'll solve them now if you like 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 Now notice that when unscrewing the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.400
 camp behind the paddock itself 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.330
 with turns then you have to definitely 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.220
 still fix the bearing behind with a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.840
 wrench around the whole then 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.840
 to screw on properly 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:02:00.330
 and of course that's what makes him the same 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:02:02.010
 down after you screw both now 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.890
 have solved the top down 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.840
 then you can just the stabilizer 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.270
 from a bracket here offers itself 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.899
 knock out at the top and the new one 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.899
 use 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 now comes the new one 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.340
 stani into play or tie rod this 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.340
 only then do this below 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.850
 she screws easily with the new one 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.489
 Mother and now we have to 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.769
 because of that I know because the star 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.690
 how well relaxed he is now 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.049
 also continued to slide up 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 call this board or something below 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.549
 similar to the brake disc below 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.860
 put the cart in and one piece 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.079
 Lower the pieces that the shock absorber 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.709
 a little bit in quotes 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.200
 a mistake 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.519
 So as you said, take it now 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.799
 something stable and here 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.299
 can leave and you let now 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.299
 The car down easily 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.820
 Now you take the stapi to hand 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.910
 you can see the difference here now 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.030
 to the hole how much it is about and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:47.770
 this height 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:51.810
 Now let the car down to her 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:04:11.740
 the stapi afterwards without problems easy 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:13.630
 You can use it all while you do 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.340
 Now you write that leave you 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.340
 vehicle exactly in this position 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.170
 after hanging the coupling rod 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.200
 screwed both screws now 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.020
 Again, well, do not forget these too 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:36.610
 because they are otherwise in the camp 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:40.630
 would go through coupling rods 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.450
 depending on the manufacturer between me 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:59.380
 say 80 even 130 newton meters stand 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:05:02.560
 of course, and of course the same thing 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.630
 below important please as I said not 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.030
 take that away 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.060
 When screwing should the stabilizer 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.950
 and the paddock rod together 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.950
 fit that they are relaxed 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.580
 After that you can get the vehicle again 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.500
 cancel 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.760
 the construction with the board or 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.350
 similar depending on what you think 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.160
 it needs to be stable 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.290
 solve the wheel and do it again 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.660
 the change of the coupling rod is thus 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.860
 already completed 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.710
 People as you can see it is 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.330
 no big story and is 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.530
 but also the corresponding one 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.960
 components of the often breaks 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.090
 but you can not change yourself 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.110
 problem if you liked it all 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.690
 of course, then, as always, I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.370
 About the comment a thumb high who 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.020
 does not know us now 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.520
 Here's the yellow subscribe button 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.260
 thus always stays up to date 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.940
 come to our left now 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.500
 last video and that we 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.750
 Fuel filter on a diesel 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.300
 changes and right you see if euro 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.590
 HÃ¼ter oil storage are broken all parts 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.170
 of course I always find if you are now 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.000
 down on the amber we are depressed 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.690
 on all social media platforms 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.250
 wants to follow 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.260
 he sees the logos now 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.680
 displayed until next time servus 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.680
 look at
