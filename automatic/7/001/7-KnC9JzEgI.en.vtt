and if you want to search points of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.930 
and if you want to search points of
interests<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:42.340> hit<00:02:42.580> points<00:02:42.850> of

interests like this hit points of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.240 
interests like this hit points of
interest<00:02:43.330> let's<00:02:43.930> say<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.110> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.290> find<00:02:44.440> target

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.979 

it<00:02:51.250> automatically<00:02:51.760> weeds<00:02:52.269> out<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> letters

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
it automatically weeds out the letters

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.960 
it automatically weeds out the letters
and<00:02:53.200> stuff<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.470> try<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.700> minimize<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:55.239> search

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and stuff to try to minimize my search

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.900 
and stuff to try to minimize my search
and<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.390> also<00:02:58.709> well<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:01.600> pretty<00:03:01.810> much

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
and I can also well it's pretty much

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.600 
and I can also well it's pretty much
as<00:03:04.450> narratives<00:03:05.020> it'll<00:03:05.200> go<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:05.710> that's<00:03:06.340> all<00:03:06.460> its

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
as narratives it'll go so that's all its

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.730 
as narratives it'll go so that's all its
going<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.790> let<00:03:06.940> me<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:08.020> gonna<00:03:08.140> hit<00:03:08.290> list

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.940 

and<00:03:11.740> gives<00:03:11.980> me<00:03:12.100> all<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.600> options<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.950> target

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and gives me all the options for target

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.000 
and gives me all the options for target
I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:16.240> this<00:03:16.450> one<00:03:16.660> would<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.050> one<00:03:17.380> so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
I think this one would be the one so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.790 
I think this one would be the one so
let's<00:03:18.820> go<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.060> hit<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.390> one<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.530> can<00:03:20.680> also

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
let's go and hit that one and I can also

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.690 
let's go and hit that one and I can also
specify<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.800> specific<00:03:23.800> city<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.370> want<00:03:24.640> it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
specify the specific city that I want it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.180 
specify the specific city that I want it
in<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.090> let's<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:25.960> find<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> nearest<00:03:26.410> one

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.010 

it<00:03:30.190> says<00:03:30.460> that<00:03:30.640> I'm<00:03:30.760> actually<00:03:31.090> sitting<00:03:31.570> right

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
it says that I'm actually sitting right

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:41.460 
it says that I'm actually sitting right
at<00:03:32.800> one<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:35.970> way<00:03:36.970> over<00:03:37.480> there<00:03:37.660> somewhere<00:03:40.470> so

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
at one it's way over there somewhere so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.350 
at one it's way over there somewhere so
you<00:03:41.830> pretty<00:03:42.250> much<00:03:42.430> get<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> point

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you pretty much get the point

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.390 
you pretty much get the point
if<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.840> hit<00:03:43.960> guide<00:03:46.920> it'll<00:03:47.920> pretty<00:03:48.040> much<00:03:48.130> do<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
if I hit guide it'll pretty much do the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.920 
if I hit guide it'll pretty much do the
exact<00:03:48.700> same<00:03:48.730> thing<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.210> I<00:03:49.360> just<00:03:49.420> did<00:03:49.660> before

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
exact same thing that I just did before

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.630 
exact same thing that I just did before
so<00:03:50.920> I'm<00:03:50.980> going<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.130> go<00:03:51.220> back<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.520> hit

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
so I'm going to go back and hit

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.350 
so I'm going to go back and hit
destination<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:54.340> plug<00:03:54.550> in<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> specific

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
destination I can plug in a specific

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.500 
destination I can plug in a specific
