plan<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:24.779> feels<00:00:25.079> very<00:00:25.220> delicate<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
plan it feels very delicate when you

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.740 
plan it feels very delicate when you
touch<00:00:26.700> it<00:00:26.840> but<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.380> definitely<00:00:29.750> drought

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pack that I had I got pushed to the back

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
pack that I had I got pushed to the back
and<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.790> didn't<00:00:39.120> water<00:00:39.330> it<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> these

and I didn't water it and all of these

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.730 
and I didn't water it and all of these
she<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.580> not<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> plant<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740

wanted to give you were on the medjool

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.200 
wanted to give you were on the medjool
date<00:01:02.579> seeds<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.870> remember<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.799> planted

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
date seeds if you remember I had planted

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.139 
date seeds if you remember I had planted
six<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.649> root<00:01:07.890> riot<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.909> see

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
six of those into the root riot to see

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.110 
six of those into the root riot to see
if<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.079> germinate<00:01:10.800> I've<00:01:11.250> never<00:01:11.820> tried

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
if they would germinate I've never tried

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.510 
if they would germinate I've never tried
growing<00:01:12.630> date<00:01:13.020> seeds<00:01:13.320> before<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.340> date

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
growing date seeds before their date

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.550 
growing date seeds before their date
palms<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:18.060> excited<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.870> try<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
palms but I was excited to try because I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
palms but I was excited to try because I
I<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:20.130> love<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> grow<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.940> date<00:01:21.420> palm<00:01:21.630> out

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I would love to grow a date palm out

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.250 
I would love to grow a date palm out
here<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> anyway<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.530> decided<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.040> some

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
here and so anyway I decided to put some

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.100 
here and so anyway I decided to put some
extra<00:01:28.260> that<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> had<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.340> wet<00:01:30.090> paper<00:01:30.270> towel<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
extra that I had in wet paper towel in a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
extra that I had in wet paper towel in a
plastic<00:01:31.530> bag<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:33.710> had<00:01:34.710> some<00:01:35.479> actual

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
plastic bag and I had some actual

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.469 
plastic bag and I had some actual
germination<00:01:37.190> starting<00:01:38.190> here<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:39.180> real

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
germination starting here I'm real

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.190 
germination starting here I'm real
excited<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.760> these<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:42.900> hard

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
excited you see the these have very hard

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.930 
excited you see the these have very hard
shells<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.190> see<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:44.729> would

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
shells so I could see where this would

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.260 
shells so I could see where this would
be<00:01:45.090> difficult<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.220> root<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.549> start

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
be difficult for the root to start

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.820 
be difficult for the root to start
coming<00:01:48.600> through<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
coming through but it is we can see that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.160 
coming through but it is we can see that
nut<00:01:52.830> meat<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:56.150> let's<00:01:57.150> see<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.600> have

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
nut meat so I have let's see I have

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
nut meat so I have let's see I have
three<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.820> then

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
three here that are doing that and then

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
three here that are doing that and then
I<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.540> impatient<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
I got a little impatient because I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
I got a little impatient because I
couldn't<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
couldn't see what was going on and the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.990 
couldn't see what was going on and the
root<00:02:06.720> riot<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.619> sponge<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.189> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
root riot and the little sponge and I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.270 
root riot and the little sponge and I
started<00:02:09.450> pulling<00:02:10.170> him<00:02:10.409> out<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.769> looking<00:02:11.129> at

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
started pulling him out and looking at

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.390 
started pulling him out and looking at
him<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:13.250> out<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.669> six<00:02:14.969> in<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.389> root<00:02:15.599> riot

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
him but out of the six in the root riot

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.470 
him but out of the six in the root riot
two<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.579> them<00:02:17.790> had

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
two of them had

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.369 
two of them had
roots<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:19.409> like<00:02:19.650> these<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:21.050> four<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.200> them

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
roots just like these and four of them

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.820 
roots just like these and four of them
did<00:02:22.650> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
did it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.800 
did it
so<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.159> four<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> didn't<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.090> moved<00:02:24.480> into

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so the four that didn't I moved into

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.979 
so the four that didn't I moved into
