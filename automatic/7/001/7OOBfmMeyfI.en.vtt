like Dwight Howard is on tonight's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.770 
like Dwight Howard is on tonight's

episode and they're really good which

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
episode and they're really good which
makes<00:01:21.990> me<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.640> kind<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
makes me think that what I do is kind of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
makes me think that what I do is kind of
a<00:01:23.970> joke<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> living<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.159> certainly

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a joke for a living because I certainly

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
a joke for a living because I certainly
couldn't<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.710> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
couldn't do what they do but there is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
couldn't do what they do but there is
like<00:01:29.280> sort<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> similarity<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.360> performance

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like sort of similarity of performance

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
like sort of similarity of performance
under<00:01:31.049> pressure<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.700> wanting<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
under pressure and you know wanting to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
under pressure and you know wanting to
ham<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> crowd<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
ham it up for the crowd and that kind of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
ham it up for the crowd and that kind of
thing<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.670> those<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.450> similar

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
thing I think those things are similar

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
thing I think those things are similar
when<00:01:37.619> did<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.340> funny<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:40.560> guess

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
when did you know you were funny I guess

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
when did you know you were funny I guess

back in grade school I would crack up
people<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.950> class<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.850> trouble<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> lot

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
people in class and get in trouble a lot

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.749 
people in class and get in trouble a lot
and<00:01:45.899> spend<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.350> spent<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.070> sixth<00:01:47.340> grade<00:01:47.579> in

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759

of<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:31.980> movie<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.430> saw<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.240> movie<00:04:33.630> about<00:04:33.750> 50

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
of the movie I saw the movie about 50

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.960 
of the movie I saw the movie about 50
times<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.640> chemistry

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
times and it's just the chemistry

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.360 
times and it's just the chemistry
between<00:04:36.300> these<00:04:36.690> two<00:04:36.960> mismatched<00:04:37.500> characters

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
between these two mismatched characters

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.190 
between these two mismatched characters
was<00:04:38.790> what<00:04:39.060> really<00:04:39.240> I've<00:04:39.540> found<00:04:39.780> intriguing

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
was what really I've found intriguing

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.050 
was what really I've found intriguing
and<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:41.160> don't<00:04:41.340> like<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.460> think<00:04:41.730> about<00:04:41.790> this

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
and we don't like to think about this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.480 
and we don't like to think about this
but<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.390> been<00:04:42.540> about<00:04:42.690> 40<00:04:43.170> years<00:04:43.530> since<00:04:43.920> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
but it's been about 40 years since the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.940 
but it's been about 40 years since the
original<00:04:44.970> TV<00:04:45.570> show<00:04:45.750> went<00:04:45.960> out<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.230> air<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.740> I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
original TV show went out the air so I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.970 
original TV show went out the air so I
figured<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.610> was<00:04:47.700> time<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.000> do<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.240> again

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
figured it was time to do it again

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.050 
figured it was time to do it again

cage metal bat a huge metal bat it's a
bat<00:06:58.039> wing<00:06:58.309> you<00:06:58.580> know<00:06:58.759> and<00:06:59.149> it's<00:06:59.300> about<00:06:59.569> three
