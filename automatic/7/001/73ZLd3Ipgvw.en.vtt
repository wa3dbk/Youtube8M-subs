00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
everything and also the plum dark red

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.710 
everything and also the plum dark red
lips<00:01:05.400> were<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:06.090> seen<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.470> runway<00:01:07.890> during

lips were also seen on the runway during
fashion<00:01:09.720> week<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.320> i<00:01:10.650> thought<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.909> be

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
fashion week so i thought that would be

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
fashion week so i thought that would be
appropriate<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> look<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
appropriate to do this look because it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
appropriate to do this look because it
seems<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.580> something<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.020> worn

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
seems like something that can be worn

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
seems like something that can be worn
during<00:01:16.470> fall<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> good<00:01:18.180> light<00:01:18.509> smoky<00:01:19.229> eye

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.210 
long now taking a black pencil liner I'm
going<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.510> apply<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.350> my<00:02:08.380> waterline<00:02:09.190> and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
going to apply it to my waterline and

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.130 
going to apply it to my waterline and
bottom<00:02:09.759> lids<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.240> then<00:02:10.390> I'm<00:02:10.509> also<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:11.080> to

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
bottom lids and then I'm also going to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.280 
bottom lids and then I'm also going to
line<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.100> on<00:02:12.490> my<00:02:12.820> top<00:02:13.090> lids<00:02:16.020> also<00:02:17.020> going<00:02:17.170> to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
line it on my top lids also going to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.740 
line it on my top lids also going to
gently<00:02:17.500> look<00:02:17.950> lift<00:02:18.490> up<00:02:18.640> my<00:02:19.000> upper<00:02:19.300> lid<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
gently look lift up my upper lid and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.949 
gently look lift up my upper lid and
then<00:02:19.780> line<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.380> also<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.160> let's<00:02:22.150> move<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
then line that also and let's move on to

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.890 
then line that also and let's move on to
the<00:02:23.140> other<00:02:23.350> eye<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:24.130> think<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.209> best<00:02:25.420> trick<00:02:25.720> to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the other eye I think the best trick to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.600 
the other eye I think the best trick to
doing<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.320> upper<00:02:26.530> lid<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.920> doing<00:02:27.220> small

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
doing the upper lid is doing small

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880 
doing the upper lid is doing small
strokes<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.989> line<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.380> raw<00:02:29.560> looks

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
strokes so that the line of raw looks

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.500 
strokes so that the line of raw looks
nice<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.459> straight<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.730> study

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.600 

after<00:02:34.409> i'm<00:02:34.470> done<00:02:34.620> lining<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.069> eyes<00:02:35.099> i'm<00:02:35.459> going

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
after i'm done lining my eyes i'm going

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.449 
after i'm done lining my eyes i'm going
to<00:02:35.670> take<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.000> silvery<00:02:36.629> color<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.920> i'm<00:02:38.189> going<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459

primer first using the tipple one and
then<00:03:28.530> I'm<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:28.920> do<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> zigzag<00:03:29.430> motion<00:03:29.909> to

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
then I'm going to do a zigzag motion to

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.440 
then I'm going to do a zigzag motion to
apply<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.750> primer<00:03:31.139> onto<00:03:31.560> my<00:03:31.920> lashes<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.940> then
