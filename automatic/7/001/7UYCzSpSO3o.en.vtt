00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
anything that's kind of element on the 2

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.250 
anything that's kind of element on the 2
and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> 4<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> again<00:00:31.130> I'm<00:00:32.130> using<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.640> drum<00:00:32.940> rack

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
and the 4 so again I'm using a drum rack

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.750 
and the 4 so again I'm using a drum rack
for<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> snares<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> reason<00:00:35.610> why<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
for the snares now the reason why I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.660 
for the snares now the reason why I
didn't<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.230> drum<00:00:37.620> rack<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
didn't use just one drum rack and have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280 
didn't use just one drum rack and have
kicks<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.090> snares<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> same<00:00:39.840> drum<00:00:40.110> rack

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
kicks and snares in the same drum rack

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
kicks and snares in the same drum rack
even<00:00:40.559> though<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> might<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> easier<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
even though that might be easier is I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
even though that might be easier is I
want<00:00:42.930> independent<00:00:43.739> control<00:00:44.219> over<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> kicks

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
want independent control over the kicks

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
want independent control over the kicks

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
with the kicks you see I'm using this EQ

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.100 
with the kicks you see I'm using this EQ
curve<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.539> using<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.899> specific

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
on the snare I don't want this EQ curve

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
on the snare I don't want this EQ curve
on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> snare<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.210> example<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.809> gonna

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
in the high end so I would use a very

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
in the high end so I would use a very
different<00:01:03.600> plug-in<00:01:03.989> chain<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.979> my

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
different plug-in chain so I want my
kicks<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.610> running<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> separate<00:01:06.390> bus

low-end punch to it and as you can see
here<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:48.329> I've<00:01:48.450> done<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.140> I've

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
here what I've done with it is I've

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.109 
here what I've done with it is I've
actually<00:01:49.439> taken<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.220> transpose<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.820> I've

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
actually taken the transpose and I've

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.600 
actually taken the transpose and I've
pitched<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.630> down<00:01:52.009> pitching<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.100> percussion

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
pitched it down pitching your percussion

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
pitched it down pitching your percussion
is<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.149> interesting<00:01:54.720> technique<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> get

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is a really interesting technique to get

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
is a really interesting technique to get
comfortable<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.509> allows<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
comfortable with because it allows you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.859 
comfortable with because it allows you
to<00:01:58.549> tune<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.790> percussion<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.540> track

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to tune the percussion to your track

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.740 
to tune the percussion to your track
melodically<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> want<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.630> other

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
melodically if you want to or the other

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
melodically if you want to or the other
thing<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.340> use

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
thing you can really do with it is I use

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.639 
thing you can really do with it is I use
this<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> snare<00:02:06.659> sounded<00:02:07.049> pretty<00:02:07.259> pretty

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this and the snare sounded pretty pretty

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740 
this and the snare sounded pretty pretty
chubby<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.310> phat<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> wanted<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.360 
have even more
and<00:02:10.890> punch<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.270> pitched<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.750> down

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and punch and so I pitched it down

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.100 
and punch and so I pitched it down
sometimes<00:02:14.370> alternatively<00:02:15.240> with<00:02:15.510> my<00:02:15.750> snare

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
sometimes alternatively with my snare

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.170 
sometimes alternatively with my snare
lair<00:02:16.320> I'll<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> pitched<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.340> kick<00:02:17.670> drum<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
lair I'll use a pitched up kick drum to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.390 
lair I'll use a pitched up kick drum to
achieve<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.990> same<00:02:19.110> effect<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.770> again<00:02:20.220> get

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
achieve the same effect so again get

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.730 
achieve the same effect so again get
used<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.670> using<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.060> pitch<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.570> your<00:02:22.500> drum

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
used to using the pitch on your drum

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.060 
used to using the pitch on your drum
sampler<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.620> I've<00:02:25.710> added<00:02:25.830> an

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
sampler and as you can see I've added an

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.510 
sampler and as you can see I've added an
EQ<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> individual<00:02:27.630> hit<00:02:27.930> again<00:02:28.800> rolling

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
EQ to this individual hit again rolling

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.220 
EQ to this individual hit again rolling
out<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.850> low-end<00:02:30.240> higher<00:02:30.690> than<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.050> kick

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
out the low-end higher than the kick

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.660 
out the low-end higher than the kick
because<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> snare<00:02:32.310> right<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> don't

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
because this is a snare right I don't

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.250 
because this is a snare right I don't
need<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:33.030> having<00:02:33.300> all<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.510> sub<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
need to be having all this sub in it and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.050 
need to be having all this sub in it and
I'm<00:02:34.770> rolling<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> top

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I'm rolling out a little bit of the top

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.910 
I'm rolling out a little bit of the top
end<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.930> other<00:02:37.140> samples<00:02:37.770> in

end to because I have other samples in

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.730 
end to because I have other samples in
this<00:02:38.070> chain<00:02:38.400> providing<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> top-end

alright<00:02:40.740> let's<00:02:40.890> move<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.190> our<00:02:41.250> next<00:02:41.340> sample

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
alright let's move to our next sample

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.380 
alright let's move to our next sample
this<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.490> can<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.850> I'm<00:02:45.060> using<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this one is you can see I'm using the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.440 
this one is you can see I'm using the
filter<00:02:45.810> high-pass<00:02:46.350> 24<00:02:46.950> filtered<00:02:47.490> at<00:02:47.640> 96<00:02:48.210> Hertz

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
filter high-pass 24 filtered at 96 Hertz

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.950 
filter high-pass 24 filtered at 96 Hertz
and<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.490> adding<00:02:51.120> some<00:02:51.330> nice<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.930> of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
and this one is adding some nice kind of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.330 
and this one is adding some nice kind of
mid-range<00:02:52.200> punch<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.860> running

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
mid-range punch I have this running

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
mid-range punch I have this running
through<00:02:57.150> iZotope<00:02:57.630> trash<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.320> only<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.980> one

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
through iZotope trash so only this one

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.280 
through iZotope trash so only this one
sample<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.060> running<00:03:00.450> through<00:03:00.570> iZotope<00:03:01.050> trash

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
sample is running through iZotope trash

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.070 
sample is running through iZotope trash
and<00:03:01.710> I'm<00:03:02.280> using<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.760> lot<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.330> distortion<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
and I'm using a lot of distortion on it

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.900 
and I'm using a lot of distortion on it
using<00:03:04.380> clip<00:03:04.740> control<00:03:05.100> distortion<00:03:05.580> setting

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
using clip control distortion setting

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.330 
using clip control distortion setting
I'm<00:03:06.510> also<00:03:06.720> using<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.410> compressor<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:10.340> with

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I'm also using a compressor on it with

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.020 
I'm also using a compressor on it with
quite<00:03:11.580> hard<00:03:11.790> compression<00:03:12.300> I'm<00:03:12.390> using<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.780> 4.5

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
quite hard compression I'm using a 4.5

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
quite hard compression I'm using a 4.5
ratio<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.660> pretty<00:03:15.900> hard<00:03:16.080> compression

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
ratio so that's pretty hard compression

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.420 
ratio so that's pretty hard compression
and<00:03:17.360> then<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.750> trash<00:03:19.440> I'm<00:03:19.680> using<00:03:19.890> again<00:03:20.280> that

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and then in trash I'm using again that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.280 
and then in trash I'm using again that
wet/dry<00:03:21.030> slider<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.660> what<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:21.900> getting<00:03:22.170> is

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
wet/dry slider so what I'm getting is

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.020 
wet/dry slider so what I'm getting is
parallel<00:03:22.800> distortion<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.550> parallel

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
parallel distortion and parallel

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.280 
parallel distortion and parallel
compression<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.720> getting<00:03:24.960> some<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
compression so I'm getting some of the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
compression so I'm getting some of the
dry<00:03:25.500> signal<00:03:25.740> coming<00:03:26.070> through<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.520> some<00:03:27.030> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
dry signal coming through and some of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.400 
dry signal coming through and some of
the<00:03:27.210> wet<00:03:27.360> signal<00:03:27.750> coming<00:03:27.900> through<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the wet signal coming through so it's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.860 
the wet signal coming through so it's
not<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.970> delicate<00:03:30.450> control

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
not I just have more delicate control

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.270 
not I just have more delicate control
over<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:33.380> it's<00:03:34.380> an<00:03:34.500> interesting<00:03:34.650> balance

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
over it it's an interesting balance

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.520 
over it it's an interesting balance
between<00:03:35.460> distorted<00:03:36.300> percussion<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.080> clean

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
between distorted percussion and clean

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.710 
between distorted percussion and clean
percussion<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.220> find<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> more<00:03:39.000> distortion<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
percussion I find the more distortion I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.170 
percussion I find the more distortion I
use<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.920> loses<00:03:41.310> some<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.670> punch<00:03:41.970> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
use it loses some of the punch and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.750 
use it loses some of the punch and
impact<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> use<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.710> combination<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.370> heavily

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
impact so I use a combination of heavily

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
impact so I use a combination of heavily
distorted<00:03:45.150> percussion<00:03:46.080> with<00:03:46.320> clean

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
distorted percussion with clean

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
distorted percussion with clean
percussion<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> get<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.780> best<00:03:48.960> of<00:03:49.080> both

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
percussion so I get the best of both

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.250 
percussion so I get the best of both
worlds<00:03:49.260> more<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.830> less<00:03:50.660> alright<00:03:51.660> next<00:03:51.900> sample

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
worlds more or less alright next sample

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.730 
worlds more or less alright next sample
over<00:03:55.490> now<00:03:56.490> these<00:03:56.880> two<00:03:57.090> samples<00:03:57.540> I'm<00:03:57.780> using<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
over now these two samples I'm using a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.440 
over now these two samples I'm using a
little<00:03:59.070> bit<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.370> unique<00:03:59.670> technique<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
little bit of a unique technique and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.590 
little bit of a unique technique and
this<00:04:01.260> one<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> using<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.280> filter<00:04:02.580> envelope<00:04:02.730> so

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
this one is using a filter envelope so

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.080 
this one is using a filter envelope so
in<00:04:03.840> live<00:04:04.080> simpler<00:04:04.770> here<00:04:05.070> what<00:04:05.700> I've<00:04:05.820> done<00:04:05.940> is

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
in live simpler here what I've done is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.690 
in live simpler here what I've done is
I've<00:04:06.210> activated<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.050> filter<00:04:07.350> envelope<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.040> I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
I've activated the filter envelope and I

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.330 
I've activated the filter envelope and I
have<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.000> filter<00:04:09.330> on<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.920> have<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.950> high-pass

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
have the filter on I have a high-pass

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.240 
have the filter on I have a high-pass
twelve<00:04:11.850> filter<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.560> I'm<00:04:13.560> using<00:04:13.770> quite<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.100> bit

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
twelve filter and I'm using quite a bit

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.550 
twelve filter and I'm using quite a bit
of<00:04:14.340> resonance<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.200> starting<00:04:16.200> with<00:04:16.230> a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
of resonance on it starting with a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.840 
of resonance on it starting with a
filter<00:04:16.770> frequency<00:04:17.310> cutoff<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:18.090> 125<00:04:19.080> Hertz<00:04:19.850> now

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
filter frequency cutoff of 125 Hertz now

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.540 
filter frequency cutoff of 125 Hertz now
what<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.330> filter<00:04:21.540> envelope<00:04:21.840> will<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
what the filter envelope will do is it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.290 
what the filter envelope will do is it
will<00:04:23.700> automate

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
will automate

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.999 
will automate
the<00:04:24.599> filter<00:04:24.930> coming<00:04:25.229> up<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:25.620> then<00:04:25.800> back<00:04:25.979> down

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
the filter coming up and then back down

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.129 
the filter coming up and then back down
again<00:04:26.220> based<00:04:26.909> on<00:04:27.060> these<00:04:27.270> settings<00:04:27.629> so<00:04:27.840> I'm

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
again based on these settings so I'm

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.790 
again based on these settings so I'm
using<00:04:28.319> the<00:04:28.800> attack<00:04:29.099> decay<00:04:29.340> sustain<00:04:29.550> release

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
using the attack decay sustain release

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
using the attack decay sustain release
for<00:04:31.819> these<00:04:32.819> snare<00:04:33.180> drums<00:04:33.419> I'm<00:04:33.539> going<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.720> solo

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
for these snare drums I'm going to solo

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:54.490 
for these snare drums I'm going to solo
it<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.349> can<00:04:34.560> hear<00:04:34.919> what<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.460> doing<00:04:35.729> so

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.959 

this<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.620> an<00:04:55.740> interesting<00:04:55.919> technique<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.639> use

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
this is an interesting technique to use

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.450 
this is an interesting technique to use
on<00:04:57.330> percussion<00:04:58.020> because<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:59.159> filter

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
on percussion because the filter

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.240 
on percussion because the filter
envelope<00:04:59.639> shapes<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:02.009> frequency

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
envelope shapes the the frequency

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.089 
envelope shapes the the frequency
spectrum<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.509> hit<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:03.960> real<00:05:04.500> time<00:05:04.770> as<00:05:04.949> it's

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
spectrum of the hit in real time as it's

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.920 
spectrum of the hit in real time as it's
playing<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.909> just<00:05:06.270> started<00:05:06.659> doing<00:05:06.780> this

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
playing so I just started doing this

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.540 
playing so I just started doing this
with<00:05:07.139> my<00:05:07.289> percussion<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:07.889> really<00:05:08.340> really

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
with my percussion and I really really

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.909 
with my percussion and I really really
like<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.090> sound<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.659> creates<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.530> I

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
like the sound that it creates so I

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.020 
like the sound that it creates so I
think<00:05:11.069> I'm<00:05:11.129> gonna<00:05:11.250> be<00:05:11.370> doing<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:11.699> more<00:05:11.909> and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
think I'm gonna be doing this more and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.339 
think I'm gonna be doing this more and
more<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.360> wanted<00:05:12.569> to<00:05:12.629> show<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.840> guys<00:05:13.110> as<00:05:13.319> I

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
more but I wanted to show you guys as I

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.119 
more but I wanted to show you guys as I
learn<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:14.300> next<00:05:15.300> hit<00:05:15.479> over<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.710> same<00:05:16.889> thing

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
learn it next hit over is the same thing

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.360 
learn it next hit over is the same thing
except<00:05:17.460> it's<00:05:17.610> even<00:05:17.819> higher<00:05:18.000> up<00:05:18.300> so<00:05:22.129> this<00:05:23.129> one

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
except it's even higher up so this one

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.420 
except it's even higher up so this one
has<00:05:23.729> a<00:05:23.759> couple<00:05:24.180> things<00:05:24.300> going<00:05:24.659> on<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.860> again<00:05:26.250> is

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
has a couple things going on it again is

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.490 
has a couple things going on it again is
using<00:05:26.819> a<00:05:27.060> filter<00:05:27.360> envelope<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:27.990> instead<00:05:28.380> of

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
using a filter envelope but instead of

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.409 
using a filter envelope but instead of
using<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:29.130> high-pass<00:05:29.490> 12<00:05:29.909> I'm<00:05:30.090> using<00:05:30.270> a

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
using the high-pass 12 I'm using a

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.959 
using the high-pass 12 I'm using a
high-pass<00:05:30.779> 24<00:05:31.469> I'm<00:05:31.740> high<00:05:32.430> passing<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:32.880> a

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
high-pass 24 I'm high passing it a

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.629 
high-pass 24 I'm high passing it a
little<00:05:33.240> bit<00:05:33.419> higher<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:34.370> again<00:05:35.370> I'm<00:05:35.520> using

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
little bit higher and again I'm using

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.580 
little bit higher and again I'm using
the<00:05:35.940> filter<00:05:36.300> envelope<00:05:36.449> here<00:05:36.960> with<00:05:37.139> slightly

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
the filter envelope here with slightly

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.670 
the filter envelope here with slightly
different<00:05:37.680> settings<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:39.080> I've<00:05:40.080> pitched<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
different settings and I've pitched the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.610 
different settings and I've pitched the
sample<00:05:41.039> down<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.219> little<00:05:41.430> bit
