00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.000
 good day everyone will be short now 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.460
 review on board game svintus rules 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.280
 etiquette 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 so playing it is very interesting with very 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.020
 simple rules that's fun not to play 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 and in the company from two there to 10 people 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.859
 possible but best of all if 34 people 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.730
 will at least play it here is the game 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.070
 inexpensive 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 the rule is very similar to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 rules of the board game crazy but if you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.220
 there is such a map there as a change 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.040
 there is no such direction 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:46.890
 but there are other interesting cards and so 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.340
 what the essence of the task is to get rid of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.470
 all pairs if one player eliminates 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 from all their card the game is considered 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.100
 finished all the other players consider 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.300
 how much they have part left well, easier 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.690
 just play like u from main cards 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 digital most of them 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.090
 the easiest way to finish the game is to count 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 digital ports here and then there let's say 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.160
 the one of the players and who is scoring 100 points 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 here and loses you can play the opposite 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.550
 the player who you are him 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 all the points that are on are counted 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.770
 the hands of other players and now if this 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.439
 figure there becomes 100 or 200 then 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.740
 then this player wins 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.710
 for all scored more points 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.600
 the rules are simple and that means 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.170
 let's say a five on it puddle either 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.890
 the same color blue or the same 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 number five to another 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.320
 other color can be exactly the same 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.700
 put the top five blue in not the queue then 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.659
 there is no turn you can 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.289
 reset the same ports is about to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.610
 colored cards with pictures they fall 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.510
 just the color of the color or the picture 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.930
 Do you want to lay out the Khadija card 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.690
 the player takes his hands away from if u 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.459
 he has the same card he wanted 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.630
 and it puts and already means the next 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.269
 the player takes the cards quietly hryun if 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.610
 This card is laid out while he is a player 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.090
 laid out and and again will not put the card 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.580
 everyone should be silent here if someone 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 interrupt this silence with words then 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.810
 he must draw two cards 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.760
 police blame great 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.989
 card falls absolutely on any 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.080
 on any card on any color on any 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.260
 the figure here and laid the color of this 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.450
 the clap hoof player most interesting 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.970
 card because when it is laid out 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.489
 all players must 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.730
 cover the deck with your hands but I mean 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.010
 vodka someone on which falls 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.860
 The main ports of the players if someone does not 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.760
 manages to cover the deck or covers 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.739
 her last then he takes himself on 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.310
 two cards here there are more such snake 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.000
 ports 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.030
 well, it's easier for me 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 probably play without them here's the game 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.320
 principle 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.810
 calculated on the age of players from 5 years 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.480
 that is, everyone can play a game enough 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.660
 fun especially if you have a big 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.850
 company see the rules of the game and 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.140
 detailed description you can on the website 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.520
 game xcom him
