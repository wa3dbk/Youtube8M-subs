00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
we're back in October once again this is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.750 
we're back in October once again this is
season<00:00:21.750> 2<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.800> believe<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.310> holding<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
season 2 and I believe we're holding a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.390 
season 2 and I believe we're holding a
record<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.410> 3<00:00:25.680> &amp;<00:00:25.800> 1<00:00:25.830> maybe<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
record of like what is it 3 &amp; 1 maybe I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.250 
record of like what is it 3 &amp; 1 maybe I
think<00:00:26.550> something<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
think something like that so this is a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
think something like that so this is a
very<00:00:28.619> important<00:00:29.189> game<00:00:29.369> against<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> division

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
anyway let's take a look at the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
anyway let's take a look at the
simulation<00:01:20.479> let's<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.900> get<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> score

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
simulation let's see if we get a score

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
simulation let's see if we get a score
on<00:01:22.530> our<00:01:22.950> first<00:01:23.280> drive<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.820> actually<00:01:27.210> go

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
on our first drive and we actually go

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
on our first drive and we actually go
down<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> field<00:01:28.380> goal<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.070> deal

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
down and get a field goal so I can deal

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
down and get a field goal so I can deal
with<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.329> Cam

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with that that's pretty good so Cam

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
with that that's pretty good so Cam
Newton<00:01:30.960> drop<00:01:31.140> me<00:01:31.229> yep<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:32.130> has<00:01:32.340> his<00:01:32.520> man

Newton drop me yep and he has his man

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.010 
Newton drop me yep and he has his man
over<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> middle<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:33.900> about

cross the goldmine I'm surprised I

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.480 
cross the goldmine I'm surprised I
didn't<00:06:02.410> challenge<00:06:02.560> that<00:06:02.890> I'm<00:06:03.040> glad<00:06:03.310> they

didn't<00:06:03.760> challenge<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.990> could<00:06:05.200> have

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
didn't challenge that that could have

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.800 
didn't challenge that that could have
been<00:06:05.410> controversial<00:06:05.980> so<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:06.850> stopped<00:06:07.300> him<00:06:07.330> on

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
been controversial so I stopped him on

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.840 
been controversial so I stopped him on
third<00:06:08.080> down<00:06:08.410> he<00:06:08.680> did<00:06:08.830> not<00:06:09.010> get<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.370> first<00:06:09.610> down

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
third down he did not get the first down

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.230 
third down he did not get the first down
but<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:12.070> course<00:06:12.310> they're<00:06:12.520> going<00:06:12.730> forward<00:06:13.150> on

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
but of course they're going forward on

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.020 
but of course they're going forward on
four<00:06:13.510> finishes<00:06:14.220> Cam<00:06:15.220> Newton's<00:06:15.610> holder<00:06:15.910> the

four finishes Cam Newton's holder the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.459 
four finishes Cam Newton's holder the
ball<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.540> he<00:06:16.600> goes<00:06:16.840> down<00:06:17.200> he's<00:06:17.410> sad

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.669 

he's<00:06:23.129> sacked<00:06:23.519> on<00:06:23.789> the<00:06:23.939> play<00:06:24.209> and<00:06:24.689> let's<00:06:25.409> take<00:06:25.619> a

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:25.679 
he's sacked on the play and let's take a

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:30.139 
he's sacked on the play and let's take a
look<00:06:25.919> at<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.129> simulation<00:06:26.339> right<00:06:27.029> here<00:06:29.029> so<00:06:30.029> I'm

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
look at the simulation right here so I'm

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:31.549 
look at the simulation right here so I'm
checking<00:06:30.419> to<00:06:30.629> see<00:06:30.899> what<00:06:31.080> we're<00:06:31.229> gonna<00:06:31.319> do

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
checking to see what we're gonna do

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.169 
checking to see what we're gonna do
right<00:06:31.709> here<00:06:31.949> if<00:06:32.129> we<00:06:32.279> score<00:06:32.519> a<00:06:32.580> touchdown<00:06:32.849> it's

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
right here if we score a touchdown it's

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:35.600 
right here if we score a touchdown it's
over<00:06:33.569> but<00:06:33.779> we<00:06:34.050> get<00:06:34.199> a<00:06:34.229> field<00:06:34.559> goal<00:06:34.769> so<00:06:35.489> they

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
over but we get a field goal so they

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.429 
over but we get a field goal so they
have<00:06:35.819> one<00:06:36.059> more<00:06:36.269> opportunity<00:06:36.659> they<00:06:37.199> have

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
have one more opportunity they have

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.679 
have one more opportunity they have
another<00:06:37.679> crack<00:06:38.009> at<00:06:38.039> it<00:06:38.249> and<00:06:38.489> not<00:06:39.179> a<00:06:39.239> good<00:06:39.479> way

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
another crack at it and not a good way

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.709 
another crack at it and not a good way
to<00:06:39.749> start<00:06:40.110> off<00:06:40.349> he's<00:06:41.099> set<00:06:41.429> to<00:06:41.639> gain<00:06:41.819> 3rd<00:06:42.209> and<00:06:42.509> 9

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
to start off he's set to gain 3rd and 9

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.199 
to start off he's set to gain 3rd and 9
let's<00:06:43.439> see<00:06:43.529> what<00:06:43.679> I'm<00:06:43.739> gonna<00:06:43.800> do<00:06:44.039> with<00:06:44.849> that

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
let's see what I'm gonna do with that

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:48.049 
let's see what I'm gonna do with that
and<00:06:45.629> over<00:06:46.199> to<00:06:46.319> the<00:06:46.349> right<00:06:46.619> side<00:06:46.979> he's<00:06:47.759> out<00:06:48.029> of

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
and over to the right side he's out of

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.509 
and over to the right side he's out of
bounds<00:06:48.300> so<00:06:48.629> another<00:06:48.899> 4th<00:06:49.229> down<00:06:49.499> all<00:06:50.159> we<00:06:50.399> have

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:50.519 
bounds so another 4th down all we have

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.279 
bounds so another 4th down all we have
to<00:06:50.639> do<00:06:50.759> is<00:06:50.909> stop<00:06:51.149> him<00:06:51.330> right<00:06:51.629> here<00:06:51.899> we<00:06:52.110> gotta

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
to do is stop him right here we gotta

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:53.869 
to do is stop him right here we gotta
get<00:06:52.469> this<00:06:52.649> dug<00:06:52.919> we're<00:06:53.459> gonna<00:06:53.580> get<00:06:53.729> this

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:53.879 
get this dug we're gonna get this

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.369 
get this dug we're gonna get this
victory<00:06:54.269> so<00:06:54.449> he<00:06:54.569> dropped<00:06:54.869> him<00:06:54.959> back<00:06:54.989> looking

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
victory so he dropped him back looking

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.839 
victory so he dropped him back looking
for<00:06:55.499> something<00:06:55.889> I<00:06:56.099> wanted<00:06:56.369> him<00:06:56.489> to<00:06:56.519> throw<00:06:56.729> it

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
for something I wanted him to throw it

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.729 
for something I wanted him to throw it
my<00:06:56.999> way<00:06:57.209> is<00:06:57.269> going<00:06:57.689> down<00:07:00.289> so<00:07:01.289> we're<00:07:01.409> gonna<00:07:01.529> walk

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:01.739 
my way is going down so we're gonna walk

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:04.399 
my way is going down so we're gonna walk
out<00:07:01.860> of<00:07:01.919> here<00:07:02.039> with<00:07:02.399> a<00:07:02.429> dagger<00:07:02.839> and<00:07:03.839> as<00:07:04.229> always
