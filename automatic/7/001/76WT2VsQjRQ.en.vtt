00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
shortly going to be a half grid there

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.790 
shortly going to be a half grid there
but<00:02:17.580> anyway<00:02:18.580> that's<00:02:18.819> what<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.150> looks<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.800> my

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
but anyway that's what it looks like my

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.330 
but anyway that's what it looks like my
few<00:02:21.099> net<00:02:21.280> it's<00:02:21.790> pretty<00:02:22.030> big<00:02:22.239> unit<00:02:23.340> looking

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
few net it's pretty big unit looking

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.140 
few net it's pretty big unit looking
inside<00:02:24.700> nice<00:02:25.120> coil<00:02:25.540> inside<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:26.700> let's<00:02:27.700> get<00:02:28.090> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
inside nice coil inside so let's get a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.110 
inside nice coil inside so let's get a
picture<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.599> there<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.400> nice<00:02:30.400> coil<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.910> there

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
picture in there but nice coil in there

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.979 
picture in there but nice coil in there
so<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.489> chimney<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.629> direct

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
so that's the chimney so going to direct

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.920 
so that's the chimney so going to direct
vent<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.349> outside

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
vent it outside

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.670 
vent it outside
there<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.019> go<00:02:42.360> echo<00:02:43.360> temp<00:02:43.630> was<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.470> really

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
that cold water running in but yeah at

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.140 
that cold water running in but yeah at
my<00:03:31.569> pump<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.579> no<00:03:33.579> more<00:03:33.849> electric<00:03:34.599> heat

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
my pump here and no more electric heat

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.479 
my pump here and no more electric heat
I've<00:03:37.150> decided<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.690> put<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.919> pumps<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
I've decided to put it that pumps the

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.449 
I've decided to put it that pumps the
water<00:03:39.669> inside<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.810> hot<00:03:41.590> water<00:03:41.859> tank<00:03:42.130> because

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
water inside the hot water tank because

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.210 
water inside the hot water tank because
the<00:03:42.549> art<00:03:42.700> water<00:03:42.849> type<00:03:43.090> also<00:03:43.450> has<00:03:43.780> an<00:03:43.900> element

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the art water type also has an element

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.670 
the art water type also has an element
that's<00:03:45.220> going<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.609> heated<00:03:45.970> by<00:03:46.169> my<00:03:47.169> Soler's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
that's going to be heated by my Soler's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.339 
that's going to be heated by my Soler's
on<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:48.459> dump<00:03:48.700> load<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.840> that's<00:03:49.930> my<00:03:50.109> next

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
water used to turn on with a timer up

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.199 
water used to turn on with a timer up
there<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:02.739> used<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.609> run<00:04:03.730> only<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.120> now

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209

we're a day six o'clock in the morning

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.240 
we're a day six o'clock in the morning
and<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.669> still<00:04:06.910> have<00:04:07.060> hot<00:04:07.299> water<00:04:07.329> till<00:04:08.250> 5:00

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
and I still have hot water till 5:00

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.059 
and I still have hot water till 5:00
5:30<00:04:09.579> so

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
5:30 so

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.420 
5:30 so
with<00:04:12.819> this<00:04:13.060> instead<00:04:14.019> of<00:04:14.170> putting<00:04:14.920> cold<00:04:15.219> water

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
with this instead of putting cold water

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.270 
with this instead of putting cold water
inside<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:17.019> putting<00:04:17.259> warm<00:04:17.620> water<00:04:17.919> inside

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
inside it it's putting warm water inside

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.659 
inside it it's putting warm water inside
the<00:04:18.430> tank<00:04:18.459> all<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> time<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.870> will<00:04:20.669> never

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
the tank all the time so it will never

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.850 
the tank all the time so it will never
turn<00:04:21.910> on<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:23.320> produces<00:04:23.830> about<00:04:24.039> 3.5

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
turn on and this produces about 3.5

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.520 
turn on and this produces about 3.5
gallons<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:26.979> water<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.580> minute<00:04:30.930> 70,000<00:04:31.930> BTU<00:04:32.289> so

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
gallons of water a minute 70,000 BTU so

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.939 
gallons of water a minute 70,000 BTU so
I<00:04:32.560> got<00:04:32.830> 68,000<00:04:33.639> BTU<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.180> order<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.229> on<00:04:35.320> eBay<00:04:35.680> I

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
I got 68,000 BTU I order it on eBay I

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.550 
I got 68,000 BTU I order it on eBay I
wanted<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.759> try<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.350> next<00:04:38.350> year<00:04:38.470> I'll

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
wanted to try it and next year I'll

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.249 
wanted to try it and next year I'll
probably<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:39.009> another<00:04:39.250> one<00:04:39.430> right<00:04:39.669> beside<00:04:39.880> it

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
probably put another one right beside it

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.460 
probably put another one right beside it
then<00:04:41.259> I'll<00:04:41.380> have<00:04:41.500> some<00:04:41.710> hot<00:04:42.160> water<00:04:42.400> lots<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.120> it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
then I'll have some hot water lots of it

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.409 
then I'll have some hot water lots of it
so<00:04:44.470> anyway<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:44.919> wanted<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.370> turn<00:04:46.300> away

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
so anyway I just wanted to turn away

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.909 
so anyway I just wanted to turn away
from<00:04:46.509> solar<00:04:47.289> panels<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.919> show<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:48.759> little

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
from solar panels and show you my little

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.820 
from solar panels and show you my little
gadget<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.099> I<00:04:51.130> just<00:04:51.400> installed<00:04:52.680> for<00:04:53.680> hot

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
gadget that I just installed for hot

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.890 
gadget that I just installed for hot
water<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.729> there<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.840> is<00:04:56.039> equal<00:04:57.039> temp

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
water and there it is equal temp

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.889 
water and there it is equal temp
great<00:04:58.900> stuff<00:04:59.139> see<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.740> later
