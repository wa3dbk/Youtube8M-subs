00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.089
 who don't come looking to the future 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.580
 and strives to always have enough energy for all of us 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.699
 fossil fuels can also be used as a natural gas college 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.669
 we are looking for concrete sustainable energy solutions 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.230
 solutions that are always feasible but sometimes also innovative in this way 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.159
 old the energy affordable and available 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.050
 also in the future 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.460
 in addition to deploying large-scale sustainable energy solutions such as 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 wind farms residential areas on solar energy 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.720
 or provide green energy via the grid 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.200
 I think it is important that everyone is aware of his or her 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 own energy consumption 9 at home 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.000
 That is why an eco together with the US company has an innovative one 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 has developed a device that shows total energy consumption in the home 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.790
 the watcher 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.370
 the murder circulation and simple display instantly see how much it uses in the house 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 we bring the meter cupboard into the living room 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.630
 You can see at a glance how much power the electrical devices use in you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.360
 daily housekeeping 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.570
 this makes the emission visible and I can easily get you in sight 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 the world series and simple tool for saving energy 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 ultimately you decide whether you will do this and how 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.189
 the masseur is a design by design and marcel van der schaaf 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 and consists of a sensor 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 has received and received from June 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 The transmitter unit and sensor are connected to the electricity meter in the meter cupboard 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.360
 plugged in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 these communicate with the receiver a small design device that you put in it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.680
 outlet 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.730
 the display immediately shows the consumption of all connected electrical devices 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.730
 devices throughout the house 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.370
 when the device is switched on you see the energy consumption change and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 do you know how much energy this device uses 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.919
 for example, the energy consumption of everyday activities can be TV 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.039
 look 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.379
 to computer 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.620
 its supports iron a kettle directly on the display for the rejected 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.819
 But with the jogi being sold you can see at a glance how much energy is being used 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.169
 is in total 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.169
 door woods has a memory function 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.989
 in addition to the consumption of the moment the fact that device is also historical 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.059
 data on 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.999
 for example from the last 24 hours 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.430
 and this of all devices in service and running as if had been on 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.229
 by being aware of what you use, you can use energy more efficiently 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.129
 and that can result in savings of around 10 to 20 percent 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.769
 market recovery 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.829
 that's good for the future 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.359
 it saves around 60 euros in electricity costs 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.679
 that is the goal of an ecoduct 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:08.429
 we are moving forward
