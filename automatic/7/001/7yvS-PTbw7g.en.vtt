00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 Even a pioneer in helmet making in Japan has a long history of washing 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:23.240
 To start making their own mold in order to achieve the era founder the form is not the form of a helmet 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:30.480
 History of making helmet was launched from 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 We created a mold for molding a bowtie in-house in which the moon clothes washing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:42.170
 This makes it possible to compare to asking a specialist to produce molds 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:48.620
 The production correction can be done smoothly, and a large number of safe forms that can be ideal can be made water polo 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 This time of Arai channel picked up whether the mold is produced How in the car 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.899
 I think that want to go 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 In order to manufacture a mold, first set a bowtie as a model in a 3d scanner and 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.740
 I'm watching you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.840
 Design with bow-tie shape data read by a 3d scanner 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.120
 Based on this and receiving mold 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.190
 Perform viewpoint shaping from the die that has been cut out 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.650
 Because the bow-tie shape will be reliable in terms of safety performance 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.680
 I will test it 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.620
 It needs to be corrected 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.710
 A bowtie to be a model 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.210
 Correct by hand 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:32.290
 Re-processing of the scanning to mold the body again 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:37.750
 Repeat this process over and over again until you get the idea you want 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.159
 It is big for us to consider the test data and be able to modify the sponge mold 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.830
 In merit 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:52.440
 It seems that a compact, high-safety cap body can be created by it 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:58.020
 It is one of the great features of Arai that we manufacture bow-tie molds in-house 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:03.290
 Arai can use this difference to protect the rider's head in the event of an accident 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:10.119
 We will continue to pursue a round, smooth and strong bow tie 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.119
 Arai 's differences consist of small differences accumulated over a long history
