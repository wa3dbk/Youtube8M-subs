00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.730
 hello to all this second tips that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.140
 you will earn a little bit in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.390
 productivity but you know what we 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.850
 said a little more a little equal 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.940
 a group e so here we will see how 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.770
 quickly duplicate objects then 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.160
 of course you find the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 forever copy / paste so control 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.100
 these checks go so this is a forgiveness 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.510
 control these controls v here and so 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.220
 there you have your cube that is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.489
 positioned in the same place as your 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.489
 home club 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.160
 you also have the possibility a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.590
 times your cube selected to make a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.930
 control click drag like these 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.930
 in the object manager and so 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.979
 your cube again appears to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.990
 its original location 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.130
 so here we come back exactly to 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.500
 principle of copy paste but you have 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 also the possibility to do that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.550
 directly in the view so either in 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.420
 highlighting an axis and aja 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.050
 since the left controls 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.300
 you see here the appearance of finally the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.340
 modification of my cursor I pull 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:40.569
 the axis and I duplicate my tube I can 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.569
 do that of course on the three axes 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.770
 I can 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 highlighting two axes 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.380
 so there I 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.500
 does a duplication but on a plane 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.799
 and not on an axis and I can do 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.539
 a free duplication so omitting 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.320
 highlight no axis by cons it 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.890
 must be my ass you are 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.890
 selected 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.209
 so here we are on copies that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.680
 are independent of each other 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.370
 therefore not to be confused with 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.380
 instances we'll see in a next 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.269
 in a next trick so here 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.040
 a tip that you who I hope you 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.099
 will save a little bit of time bye 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.099
 bye
