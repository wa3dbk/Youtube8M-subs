00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.950
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.440
 stason 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.380
 especially for hunters and all 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.369
 interesting we do a small video review 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.369
 air rifle 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 Crimean master who lives on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
 cake path near the lighthouse 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 then we met him and we are friends 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 For several years we have been talking 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.579
 We write to call up really all about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 this and so on he has his own workshop 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 and he performs guns 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 different lengths of one of them here in my 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.350
 my collection of guns small pokamist 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 protection collections are weapons from 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.930
 stainless steel made 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.159
 Here is such a pen from multi-layer 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.949
 plywood length is 65 centimeters 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.309
 among hand 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.070
 very much so it weighs about a kilogram 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.400
 800 kilogram 900 with boom it weighs 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 almost two kilos that is it such 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.729
 heavy is more expensive but because of this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.790
 gravity as if there is no toss she 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.829
 has properties such as quiet 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.720
 a shot, that is, it does not scare the fish 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:26.720
 shoot relatively quiet 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.500
 there is such a dull and cotton as if it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.790
 from what i saw i saw hunt 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.690
 Crimean hunters 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.120
 they are almost all with these guns exactly 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.800
 with such here 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.930
 on this path I have seen many hunters 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.480
 local here they all hunt with his 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 weapons some hunters hunt 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.240
 about 30 years it needs that is how it is 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 would forever and kill principle weapons and not 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.790
 I know it is impossible and most likely these husbands 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.230
 can anyone see that she has such 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.860
 weight and eat on the head well of course but 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.500
 it's not that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.190
 this gun 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.380
 here is how we see the middle hilt 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.930
 that is, with this forward very convenient 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.040
 turn off if not always allowed 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.020
 there is water 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.470
 transparency has always been good 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.440
 transparency therefore happens 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.950
 muddy water where to hunt with a long 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.470
 a gun 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:35.110
 very hard so if you have to tighten 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.510
 it is easy to deploy medium hand 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.360
 this gun is very easy that it possesses 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 the handle is in the middle and very comfortable quickly 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.910
 you can turn around to bring the fish 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.490
 vyselivat and and if you take it means that I 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.580
 I can still say this gun here 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:59.350
 comes from passively or don't flush 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.060
 hunters need to get used to it already 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.890
 got used to it as if I was not very 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 like a passive or not a dumper 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.410
 you can get used to and as if normal 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.050
 it can be changed to active on 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.340
 Magnetic put in here is almost driving 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.540
 need to hang 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 foam so that it is not so 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.190
 heavy but many hunt without up weight 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.800
 that is, even without foam many 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 the hunters hunt down and mean 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.540
 shoots and others by about four 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.989
 meters i mean i saw both shoot 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.989
 Lobana calmly absolutely shoots 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.530
 four meters full length without me 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.650
 problems, it is exactly that is even falling 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.680
 Here is such a small mullet calmly 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 guys shoot me and I was surprised 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.890
 even filmed how they hunt with this there 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.420
 small piece 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.840
 if i find it i try to insert it 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.840
 overview 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 mean two arrows 1 for sea hunting 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.489
 another for fresh it is heavier 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.250
 thicker well and able to pierce 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.320
 I guess I do not know any fish, even if 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.019
 put several of them 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.060
 fishes then i'm sure that she is about a gap with 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.500
 ease here is a one-piece harpoon 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.919
 salty snow tip which is not 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.870
 unscrewed he goes to cast charged to 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.110
 for such a gun it is not necessary here goes 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.740
 notch to demonstrate this 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.190
 notch 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.190
 that is, it does not slip the arm and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.050
 conveniently charged without being charged ie 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.260
 can i use charged to i need 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.979
 take it this arrow has 8 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.860
 millimeters thick the tip is even thicker 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.750
 because here in the north goes such 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.570
 the arrow will certainly not fly far but 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:10.510
 two meters you can confidently shoot with two 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:13.450
 meters fish big heavy armor 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.240
 let's say harpoon number two he goes sea 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.920
 I hunted with this harpoon he shot 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.920
 long enough here such 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 very convenient to shoot fish on large 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.940
 distances up to 4 meters quietly despite 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.949
 on a short shotgun 55 centimeters 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.479
 three or four meters enough to take 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.960
 good fish in the bathhouse attendant 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.599
 three-kilogram calmly without problems 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.169
 I played one and a half named him different 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:49.419
 Loban Chikov did not shoot and 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:52.930
 but one minus that for me is not very 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:56.550
 It is suitable that it is too heavy for 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.819
 she crushes me as I 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.800
 weigh 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.229
 a bit and she kind of drowns 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.720
 as an extra load so for me 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.419
 you need to make it a little easier when 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.289
 foam care 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.819
 then you can also hook the camera here 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.099
 gopro 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.669
 it will also be convenient not to shoot 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.669
 video eat 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.960
 such a short reviewer we can 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.280
 expand it's so 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.310
 show you the other side of the coin here 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.860
 such a gun 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.420
 descent here 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.630
 the main principle is everything is customizable 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.020
 if someone can not sharpen something 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.990
 bore and make softer 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.170
 but pumped about 25 kilograms 20 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.650
 25 here it is necessary to look what arrow to 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:56.000
 will be hunting 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:58.400
 here is now driving many hunters like 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.280
 as I have said above, uses this 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.970
 was friends for many years to hunt with this 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.810
 too this master did as well as 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.450
 Kiwi exhibition exhibiting different guns 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:16.970
 different lengths of pirates functionality 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:20.810
 also he has you his collections already with 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.990
 two hammers of two harpoons that is 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.240
 two-layer weapons on display there 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.520
 Many were shocked by what they saw but 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.900
 very interesting model on this we like 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.890
 would end our video review see you 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.750
 you further our transmissions 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:43.930
 Here is a brief overview of all the best 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.930
 follow us with you was stas he is luck
