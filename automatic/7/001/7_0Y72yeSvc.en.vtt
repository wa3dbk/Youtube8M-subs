this<00:00:37.830> design<00:00:38.280> lasts<00:00:38.940> forever<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.950> go

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this design lasts forever but if you go

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
this design lasts forever but if you go
carefully<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:42.300> detail<00:00:42.720> you<00:00:42.990> understand

the same time we want to be as

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:26.050 
the same time we want to be as
innovative<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.970> possible

of course knife consists of a blade and
the<00:01:29.130> handle<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.149> that's<00:01:30.450> about<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the handle and and that's about it and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
the handle and and that's about it and
still<00:01:32.630> material<00:01:33.630> tuned<00:01:33.840> proves<00:01:34.289> that<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
still material tuned proves that it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.969 
still material tuned proves that it
could<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.270> reinvented<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.720> first<00:01:37.200> feature<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
could be reinvented the first feature is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
could be reinvented the first feature is
there<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:40.549> visible<00:01:41.549> feature<00:01:42.320> that's<00:01:43.320> why

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there is no visible feature that's why

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:05.480 
there is no visible feature that's why
we<00:01:43.710> call<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.250> design<00:02:03.619> he<00:02:04.619> looked<00:02:04.860> carefully

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
we call it no design he looked carefully

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.960 
we call it no design he looked carefully
into<00:02:06.420> kitchens<00:02:06.869> watch<00:02:07.679> cooks<00:02:08.100> were<00:02:08.670> they<00:02:08.910> were

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
into kitchens watch cooks were they were

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.920 
into kitchens watch cooks were they were
using<00:02:09.450> their<00:02:09.810> knives<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.819> we<00:02:11.819> both<00:02:12.360> came<00:02:12.660> up

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
using their knives and we both came up

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.190 
using their knives and we both came up
with<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.890> idea<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.720> are<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> serious

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
with the idea that if you are a serious

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.440 
with the idea that if you are a serious
cook<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.250> knife<00:02:17.459> should<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> natural

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
cook the knife should be a natural

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.890 
cook the knife should be a natural

love<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.470> touch<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.580> handle<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:25.049> hate<00:02:25.290> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
love to touch the handle or they hate to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.900 
love to touch the handle or they hate to
touch<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.760> has<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.690> high<00:02:27.930> touch<00:02:28.579> but<00:02:29.579> in

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
it comes to the bolts and the blade

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.170 
it comes to the bolts and the blade
shade<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:50.239> it<00:02:51.019> looks<00:02:51.409> nice<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.549> looks<00:02:52.819> smooth

shade is it looks nice it looks smooth

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.270 
shade is it looks nice it looks smooth
but<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.200> was<00:02:54.439> several<00:02:55.370> years<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.819> work<00:02:56.090> because

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
but it was several years of work because

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.539 
but it was several years of work because
nobody<00:02:58.280> else<00:02:58.489> has<00:02:58.700> ever<00:02:59.180> done<00:02:59.620> a<00:03:00.620> smooth

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
nobody else has ever done a smooth

radius between the thick part and the
thin<00:03:05.659> part<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.189> have<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.549> be<00:03:08.450> very<00:03:08.750> smooth

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
thin part and you have to be very smooth

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.289 
thin part and you have to be very smooth
in<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.769> area<00:03:10.220> because<00:03:10.909> it's<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.269> area<00:03:11.480> where

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
in this area because it's the area where

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.500 
in this area because it's the area where
cook<00:03:14.299> wants<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.750> hold<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.109> knife<00:03:15.290> obviously

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
cook wants to hold the knife obviously

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.740 
cook wants to hold the knife obviously
it<00:03:17.510> becomes<00:03:17.900> less<00:03:18.260> dangerous<00:03:19.389> for<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.510> tongue

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it becomes less dangerous for the tongue

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.099 
it becomes less dangerous for the tongue
for<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.200> fingers<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.889> becomes<00:03:22.340> very<00:03:22.609> handy

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
for the fingers it becomes very handy

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.940 
for the fingers it becomes very handy
it's<00:03:24.109> easy<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.739> clean<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.720> gives<00:03:27.439> you<00:03:27.680> a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
it's easy to clean and it gives you a

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.750 
it's easy to clean and it gives you a
completely<00:03:28.280> different<00:03:28.689> stability<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
completely different stability so the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.780 
completely different stability so the
whole<00:03:32.230> process<00:03:33.230> we<00:03:33.739> went<00:03:33.950> through<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.609> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
whole process we went through with the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.330 
whole process we went through with the
technicians<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.510> Germany<00:03:35.959> was<00:03:36.769> about

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
technicians in Germany was about

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.360 
technicians in Germany was about
defining<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.919> very<00:03:39.919> little<00:03:40.189> detail<00:03:40.569> but<00:03:41.569> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
defining a very little detail but a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.270 
defining a very little detail but a
century<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.459> innovation<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.829> solution

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
century of innovation so the solution

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.539 
century of innovation so the solution
was<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.609> have<00:03:46.819> new<00:03:47.299> machinery<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.370> since<00:03:49.370> we

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
was to have new machinery and since we

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.550 
was to have new machinery and since we
are<00:03:49.579> planning<00:03:50.449> to<00:03:50.599> do<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> lot<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.049> these<00:03:51.319> knives

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
are planning to do a lot of these knives

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.009 
are planning to do a lot of these knives
we<00:03:51.889> had<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.129> buy<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> lot<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.790> machinery<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.629> this

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
we had to buy a lot of machinery so this

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.409 
we had to buy a lot of machinery so this
was<00:03:54.169> a<00:03:54.199> challenge<00:03:54.549> that's<00:03:55.549> why<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.790> love<00:03:56.150> made

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
was a challenge that's why I love made
