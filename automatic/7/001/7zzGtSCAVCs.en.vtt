00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.890
 Hello, today I want to share 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.400
 his joy finally got 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.469
 linings from alexander ponomarenko with 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 alexander we agreed that he 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.800
 will make mrs pistachio g10 and that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 lining will be completely without treatment 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 that is just flat lining which 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.529
 stand on a knife I'm standing behind him 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 processing these overlays because in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 Basically, I knew what I would need. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 because at that moment while Alexander 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.149
 I made the lining myself I was preparing 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.610
 the blade and the rest of my parts 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.219
 in pairs, does everybody remember this couple very well 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 mile 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.399
 long-suffering which is practically 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.110
 half a year lay in my disassembled 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.399
 the form 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.370
 after those who scoffed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.289
 has undergone from me but today you can 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.519
 to tell 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.519
 the return of the queen means 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 the essence was such that pistachio is 10 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.890
 top seagreen how to call it Americans 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.229
 communicating with alexander but it prompted me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.390
 that you can play principle on the contrast 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 agreed with him 100 percent 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 I had to pick a blade well for 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.890
 beginnings 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 got rid grow this terrible spider 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.720
 with my cobweb who sat here on 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.979
 this wedge stranglehold 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.599
 killed by ice all over the plane here 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.289
 made such a small venza 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:58.920
 and pro grass blade and made with tone 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:04.819
 bosch now it looks like this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 but let's move on to the pads themselves 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:13.670
 lining just gorgeous everything is fine 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.670
 everything came into place 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.240
 here with me processing I decided not to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.050
 bother over these 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.610
 complete let's say so groove and in the middle 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.610
 made for myself 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.380
 the so -called stingray skin 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.010
 I know even how right all the same about 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:48.580
 call even today in general 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.180
 on ramil returned pairs for you became 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.560
 and ask 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.580
 or for yes whatever you want to say them and so 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.020
 it will be right 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.210
 rules the clip also made her 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:11.110
 what kind of prison processing around the edges of the bolts 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:15.390
 also all the same color two one of the bolts 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.600
 here on this race I was ripped off 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.790
 thread 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.970
 it was at the very bolt that was torn off 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.780
 frequent disassembly clicking and rescued my 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 manix in magix is ​​absolutely 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.010
 all bolts are identical to the bolts of the knife bolts 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.610
 paramilitary 2 had to be replaced 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 clips by the way, too, from manix but because 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.010
 native risk pairs calf clip she was 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.860
 Exactly the same was only with black 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.770
 coated 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 she just broke down at me 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.990
 this fold place just cracked and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.990
 broke down 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.269
 Well, now I am the happy owner 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.700
 couple of miles and again you can say scary 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.159
 I miss that knife now 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.519
 chase only with him at least in 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.350
 soon Alexander again 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.729
 thank you so much for 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.410
 assisted in recovering my 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.030
 the knife 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:33.240
 need almost lost to me 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:38.610
 Now I thought would work even with 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:44.850
 more power and will make me happy as 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:47.070
 its owner, well, this is the job 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.650
 I managed to do all this for 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.120
 this morning literally half 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.919
 of the day 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.919
 it's almost four o'clock now 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.919
 I found it in the area of 5 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.470
 probably hours came then this job left 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.870
 Naturally if I did the lining 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.120
 he himself took about two to do this work 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.770
 weeks 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.860
 because to do the padding for ppm 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.860
 manually this is a very thankless task 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.470
 Manual time is spent without special 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.360
 tool without pantograph which 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:34.020
 possesses Alexander who made himself 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.150
