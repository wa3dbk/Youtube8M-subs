I<00:01:01.480> like<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:02.690> Linkin<00:01:02.930> Park<00:01:03.200> so<00:01:03.440> this<00:01:03.620> app<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.129> me

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
I like you Linkin Park so this app to me

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.429 
I like you Linkin Park so this app to me
is<00:01:04.430> good<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.939> missed<00:01:05.420> there<00:01:05.749> you<00:01:05.959> don't<00:01:06.109> want<00:01:06.350> to

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
is good I missed there you don't want to

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.940 
is good I missed there you don't want to
miss<00:01:06.590> because<00:01:06.829> that<00:01:09.579> definitely<00:01:10.719> hurts<00:01:11.719> your

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
miss because that definitely hurts your

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.149 
miss because that definitely hurts your
score<00:01:12.950> ability<00:01:13.429> there

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 

and<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.909> multiplier<00:01:21.869> has<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> start<00:01:22.500> over

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and your multiplier has to start over

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
and your multiplier has to start over
once<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> miss<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> easy<00:01:28.020> again

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
once you miss and this is the easy again

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.180 
once you miss and this is the easy again
so<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.479> capitalist<00:01:30.479> experts<00:01:31.080> out<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
so you capitalist experts out there to

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.999 
so you capitalist experts out there to
probably<00:01:32.580> do<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.149> lot<00:01:33.630> better<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
probably do this at a lot better of a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.639 
probably do this at a lot better of a
rate<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.759> am<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.049> old<00:01:40.200> guy

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
rate than I am but for an old guy

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.670 
rate than I am but for an old guy
not<00:01:41.250> bad<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.940> like<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> has<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
not bad I like this because it has a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.609

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
16 times multiplier when you tap that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
16 times multiplier when you tap that
and<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.899> how<00:02:01.399> linkin<00:02:02.399> park
