00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.320
 Welcome once again to android mobile 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.940
 I 'm with a new video in which 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.770
 your opinion will matter more than 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 never or no more than any other day of the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.240
 year since you are going to be able to choose my 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 next smartphone I am among the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 smartphones of a Chinese brand called 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.910
 top or for those of you who do not know us 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.169
 I'll leave you while I tell you the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 main characteristics and 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.130
 differences of each one a video in the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.160
 that you will be able to observe them and see how 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.780
 it develops 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.520
 so let's start with the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.620
 technical specifications of each 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.079
 terminal one rather the pros and the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.270
 cons of each one let's start with the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.760
 pros of poplar zp 990 this definitive is 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.059
 characterized by its large screen of 6 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 inches full hd and would have four 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.980
 32 gigabytes of internal memory 2 of 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.890
 ram memory and a 3 camera 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.940
 megapixels next to a 3000 battery 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.560
 look but this if we compare it with the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.009
 another device there are enough 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.950
 differences since the mole is covered 998 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.860
 would have a core record to one with 7 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.530
 gigahertz a greater power a lower 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.440
 screen since I would have 5 with 5 inches 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.090
 the same resolution and a memory 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.030
 lower internal since it would have 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.600
 only 16 gigas also memory 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.210
 ram a much better photo camera 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 since it would have 14 megapixels but with 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.830
 a lot of sensors and optimizer 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.320
 optical also a fault that is inferior 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.140
 on the battery since it would be 2000 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.340
 two thousand employees so now if you do not 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.620
 you have learned very well about 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.800
 specifications I ask you a question 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.510
 do you prefer a smartphone that has a 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 greater internal memory and greater 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.690
 screen or a smartphone that has a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.430
 better camera and a screen less than 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.470
 bottom screen and I even mean with 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.960
 the data of the devices that I have 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.670
 left so you can be today that I 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 make choose the smartphone that I'm going to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.179
 buy if you really want to be or 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.429
 simply that is to give your opinion about 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.600
 I would love for you to leave me in the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.940
 comments 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.580
 arguments for or against each 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.320
 one of the devices so happy 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.830
 parties we'll see you in a next video 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.830
 goodbye
