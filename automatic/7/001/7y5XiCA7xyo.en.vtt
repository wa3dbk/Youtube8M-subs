00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.830 

I<00:00:07.820> think<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:08.940> very<00:00:09.000> unique<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.690> have

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
I think it's very unique to have

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320 
I think it's very unique to have
different<00:00:10.230> athletes<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.650> go<00:00:11.030> you<00:00:12.030> know<00:00:12.120> that's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
different athletes to go you know that's

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.640 
different athletes to go you know that's
one<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.780> love<00:00:12.990> about<00:00:13.019> being<00:00:13.349> associated

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
one thing I love about being associated

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.499 
one thing I love about being associated
with<00:00:13.950> gate<00:00:14.130> arrays<00:00:14.340> brain<00:00:14.580> because<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.330> touch

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
with gate arrays brain because you touch

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.960 
with gate arrays brain because you touch
so<00:00:15.690> many<00:00:15.750> different<00:00:16.350> athletes<00:00:16.619> across<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so many different athletes across the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.179

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I think it's great to sit down no room

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.159 
I think it's great to sit down no room
for<00:00:23.300> athletes<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.419> so<00:00:24.570> much<00:00:24.689> knowledge<00:00:24.930> that
