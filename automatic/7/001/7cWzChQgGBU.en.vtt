00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.280
 after long discussions 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 we decided to throw ourselves in the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 becero world of video charts 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 however, click day par excellence we want 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.450
 do it a little differently than usual 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.520
 to avoid the usual discussions 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 useless on the various positions that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.740
 invariably populate the comments of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 each list 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 we therefore decided to avoid the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.260
 numbers in the top ten space games 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.420
 because in our opinion a list 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.160
 numerical is too personal and the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 important thing is the list itself not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 the order in which you play is put on 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.739
 our choices are still personal 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 be clear but are also designed for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 bring back the forgotten titles 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.719
 or to let the most video games of one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.579
 certain age 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 so today we decided to start 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.540
 with the list of titles unfairly 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.219
 underestimated those jobs they have 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.809
 sold very little despite one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.370
 excellent quality or have been 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 unfairly beaten by critics 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 better to specify one thing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 we have decided to avoid the titles of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 cult as on the kothen 2 legend of drug 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.649
 a mother 2 or valkyria chronicles since 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.969
 however they managed to earn 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.690
 over the years a non- follow-up 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.189
 indifferent 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.189
 having said that let's start 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.400
 a fighting game unjustly ignored by 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.330
 most gamers created by 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.550
 some community members 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.590
 competitive to be all that i 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.080
 marvel versus capcom would always have 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 due to be school girls is a title 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.040
 equipped with a stunning 2d graphics e 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.170
 excellently animated by a combat system 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.450
 complex is very fast and stylish from 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.220
 sell not enough apparently for 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.940
 let him sell a decent number of 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.070
 copies 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.630
 at least the last organized kickstarts 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 by developers to continue to 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:55.070
 support the game worked is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:57.890
 something in one of the lowest moments 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.410
 of the videoludic press all ign uf6 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.810
 gave a dry 3 to one of the most action 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.660
 exaggerated exalting and better designed 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.340
 of the playstation 2 3 era has a title 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.810
 which at the time gave most of the pay 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.920
 of direct competitors 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.959
 thanks incredibly gameplay 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.120
 deep and that even allowed to 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.400
 customize your style with more 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.140
 of 100 moved who knows what devil 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.660
 he had drunk that editor before 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.910
 write the piece macroscopic errors a 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.799
 enjoying part is one of the best over 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.720
 that less known titles of 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.720
 playstation 2 recover it if you can 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.700
 troika games is a little software house 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.430
 known in general but among lovers 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 of the gdr and not a little regret among his 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.360
 works there are not only the excellent arcanum 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.190
 and the temple of the unjustly ignored 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.260
 bad mental but also this 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.390
 brilliant example of first gdr 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.970
 person with a setting true to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.640
 that of the gdr pen paper of white wolf 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.630
 successful gameplay and great freedom 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.300
 left to the player 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.280
 ok the game had huge bugs and not 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.260
 the problems were missing, however, at the base 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.880
 there was a very solid skeleton that 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.390
 he should have done more in the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.390
 shops 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.560
 by the designer of the prosecution series 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.510
 beloved in Japan but 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.040
 beautifully ignored in our country 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.140
 here comes another title 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.660
 completely passed under the radar of 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.220
 European and American players who binary 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.500
 domain in our country does not have 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.180
 succeeded is really unfair yes 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.040
 after all it takes a tps with 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.560
 solid mechanics a narrative 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.209
 exciting and lots of great ideas 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.430
 however between marketing not really 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.530
 crafty and undeserved review scarsine 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.069
 the game quickly disappeared into 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.069
 oblivion 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.610
 we hear the players all the time 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.799
 complain about the stagnant situation 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.599
 of the shooters and the inability of the 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.950
 developers to create a tps with 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.200
 innovative mechanics 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.569
 then arrive well here there is too much there 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.549
 mikami's work deserves the scam 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.239
 and platinum games is completely out 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.220
 of head 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.260
 adrenaline and fast as light 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.209
 yet he was unfairly engaged 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.370
 by some critics and has actually sold 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.500
 with so many players hoping that 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.630
 sooner or later it arrives at least on PC 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.820
 so you can have some sort of second 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.479
 youth as happened to valkyria 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.250
 chronicles 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.600
 I sincerely hope we too 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.600
 deserves much more notoriety 

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:44.329
 according to some lost odyssey and the last 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.099
 old style rpg done as it should be 

00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:48.679
 this work by the creator of final 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.119
 fantasy sakaguchi was beautifully ignored 

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:53.209
 by most xbox users 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.949
 unaccustomed and interested in titles of 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.869
 this kind of thing is very sad 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.789
 whereas lost odyssey is a 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:00.829
 huge project and reinforced by a 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.359
 great story loved by almost everyone 

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:05.019
 those who have had the good fortune of 

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:05.019
 enjoy them 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.080
 at a time when the new IPs were 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.880
 ninja theory is rare as diamonds 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.650
 they decided to come up with a little game 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.900
 freely inspired by travel in 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.610
 West with a non-trivial narrative e 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.470
 gameplay sensibly divided between the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.210
 more steps to check trip e 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.700
 those actions in the role of the wiry 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 monkey it is a title of excellent 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.810
 quality that has sold very few copies 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.670
 but he deserved a brighter destiny 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.000
 we hope that the blade does not do the 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.000
 same end 

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:56.089
 released in a period of general decline 

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:57.439
 for split second driving games he had 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.329
 the papers to be 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.549
 the exception that confirms the rule was 

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:03.319
 after all an arcade racer capable of 

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:05.329
 convey a crazy feeling of 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.429
 speed to the player and to surprise him 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:09.559
 with continuously changing circuits 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:12.229
 between explosions and destroyed buildings e 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.269
 instead nothing nada nisba braking abrupt 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.919
 yes but the demonstration that often a nice one 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:19.689
 game is not enough to save a software 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.689
 house from a badly calculated release 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.190
 a metal game that can not be more metal 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.870
 with an exceptional soundtrack and the 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.060
 participation of some legends of the 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.949
 metal yet brutal legend was a 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.380
 floppone also because of a campaign 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.030
 very wrong marketing launched as 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.400
 an action game was actually a 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.840
 very original hybrid traction strategy 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.270
 from the gameplay anything but 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.220
 the problems between them was simplistic 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.020
 which a really too tight duration 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.180
 but among the hilarious dialogues 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.160
 written by shoppers is very inspired by the world 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:11.110
 There were many reasons for gambling 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:13.120
 would have deserved success on i 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.159
 Mature games are not many but mad 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.050
 world manages to stand out even between 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.849
 them with its unique look that accent 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.460
 to the bloodshed and the ultra 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.900
 Cartoonsian violence that pervades it 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.940
 another excessive work and crowd of gods 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.550
 platinum that once again sold 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.740
 crumbs without a sensible reason for 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.419
 divine charity someone makes it clear to 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.630
 average player who the case to give 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:37.170
 trust this software house 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.170
 out 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.130
 but the cures
