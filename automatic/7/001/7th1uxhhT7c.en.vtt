00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.249 

have<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:05.910> ever<00:00:06.000> turned<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.390> an<00:00:06.509> air<00:00:06.630> spray

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
have you ever turned on an air spray

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.260 
have you ever turned on an air spray
nozzle<00:00:07.649> instead<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.980> nice<00:00:08.189> dry<00:00:08.490> air<00:00:08.520> you<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.209> a

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
nozzle instead of nice dry air you got a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.970 
nozzle instead of nice dry air you got a
white<00:00:09.540> mist<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> water<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> air<00:00:10.530> spray<00:00:10.799> -

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
white mist of water in the air spray -

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.920 
white mist of water in the air spray -
it's<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.789> problem<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.180> can<00:00:12.299> affect<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.660> lot<00:00:12.809> of

this is what we're going to demonstrate
today<00:00:42.359> in<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.890> demonstration<00:00:44.429> we're<00:00:44.699> using

today in this demonstration we're using

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.149 
today in this demonstration we're using
a<00:00:45.059> lubricator<00:00:45.539> instead<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> oil<00:00:46.499> the

a lubricator instead of oil the

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.529 
a lubricator instead of oil the
lubricator<00:00:47.639> has<00:00:47.729> been<00:00:47.850> filled<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.269> water

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and the dispensing rate has been turned

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.759 
and the dispensing rate has been turned
way<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.729> so<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.690> it'll<00:00:51.809> dump<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.409> into<00:00:52.739> our

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
way up so that it'll dump water into our

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.340 
way up so that it'll dump water into our
supply<00:00:53.069> line<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:54.120> obviously<00:00:54.780> isn't<00:00:55.049> what

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
supply line this obviously isn't what

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
supply line this obviously isn't what
you<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.889> normal<00:00:56.190> situation<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.359> doing

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you want in normal situation we're doing

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
you want in normal situation we're doing
this<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.839> prove<00:00:58.019> how<00:00:58.199> effective<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.949> mg<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> at

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this to prove how effective the mg is at

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.809 
this to prove how effective the mg is at
removing<00:01:00.120> water<00:01:00.709> this<00:01:01.709> time-lapse<00:01:02.069> shows<00:01:02.609> how

that<00:01:44.549> normally<00:01:45.000> would<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.149> getting<00:01:45.630> pumped

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that normally would be getting pumped

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.989 
that normally would be getting pumped
into<00:01:46.109> our<00:01:46.289> machine<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.070> causing<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:47.969> kinds

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
into our machine and causing all kinds

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.739 
into our machine and causing all kinds
of<00:01:48.329> problems<00:01:49.700> next<00:01:50.700> I'll<00:01:50.939> flip<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> switch<00:01:51.539> so

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
of problems next I'll flip the switch so

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.569 
of problems next I'll flip the switch so
that<00:01:51.780> air<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.320> simply<00:01:52.710> routed<00:01:53.039> in<00:01:53.159> through<00:01:53.429> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that air is simply routed in through the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.300 
that air is simply routed in through the
AMG<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.509> separator<00:01:54.990> notice<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.130> now

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
AMG water separator notice that we now

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.209 
AMG water separator notice that we now
have<00:01:56.520> dry<00:01:56.820> air<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.240> problem<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.780> solved<00:01:58.219> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
have dry air a problem is solved the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.099 
have dry air a problem is solved the
exciting<00:01:59.640> part<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.079> just

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
exciting part is that it really is just

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.190 
exciting part is that it really is just
that<00:02:01.499> simple<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.969> AMG<00:02:03.329> unit<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.840> remove<00:02:04.020> up

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that simple the AMG unit can remove up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.580 
that simple the AMG unit can remove up
to<00:02:04.350> 99%<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:05.729> water<00:02:05.969> from<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> air

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
to 99% of the water from the air
