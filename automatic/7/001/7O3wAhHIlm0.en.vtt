just lightly touch this and then to
change<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.380> 50<00:01:36.950> or<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.759> know<00:01:37.880> 40<00:01:38.830> it's

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
change it to 50 or you know 40 it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.219 
change it to 50 or you know 40 it's
quite<00:01:40.009> easy<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.550> touch<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.360> use<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:44.229> they

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
quite easy to touch to use it and they

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.150 
quite easy to touch to use it and they
have<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:45.619> function<00:01:46.310> here<00:01:46.520> which<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:48.160> push

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
have this function here which is push

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.020 
have this function here which is push
the<00:01:49.550> wash<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.180> dry<00:01:51.190> 6kg<00:01:52.190> wash<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.729> dry<00:01:52.880> which

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the wash and dry 6kg wash and dry which

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.639 
the wash and dry 6kg wash and dry which
is<00:01:53.060> quite<00:01:53.390> quick<00:01:53.690> ready<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.259> wash<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
is quite quick ready it's just wash and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.290 
is quite quick ready it's just wash and
dry<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.970> one<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.210> are

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
dry it and this is the one that are

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.210 
dry it and this is the one that are
telling<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.690> which<00:01:56.899> is<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.320> anti<00:01:57.619> energy

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
telling you which is the anti energy

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.749 
telling you which is the anti energy
wash<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.300> dry<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.740> two<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
wash and dry and this two are for the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.560 
wash and dry and this two are for the
drawing<00:02:02.030> program<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.950> tend<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> use<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.300> for

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
drawing program I tend to use this for

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.509 
drawing program I tend to use this for
most<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.960> our<00:02:06.110> clothing<00:02:06.560> because<00:02:07.100> it's<00:02:07.550> dry<00:02:07.959> a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
most of our clothing because it's dry a

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.310 
most of our clothing because it's dry a
higher<00:02:10.519> temperature<00:02:11.090> well<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.930> will<00:02:12.290> be

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
higher temperature well this will be

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.030 
higher temperature well this will be
drying<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.070> lower<00:02:13.280> temperature<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.890> also

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
drying in a lower temperature they also

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.199 
drying in a lower temperature they also
have<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.730> s<00:02:16.940> press<00:02:17.769> which<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.799> for<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.830 
minutes depending on which program you
choose<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:28.070> will<00:02:28.130> be<00:02:28.280> done<00:02:28.489> by<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.720> you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
choose it will be done by then so if you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.069 
choose it will be done by then so if you
have<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.320> not<00:02:31.220> very<00:02:31.430> dirty<00:02:31.910> wash<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.930> could

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
have like not very dirty wash you could

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.699 
have like not very dirty wash you could
use<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:34.250> will<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:35.230> saving<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.440> lot<00:02:36.470> of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
use that and it will be saving a lot of

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.720 
use that and it will be saving a lot of
water<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.220> power<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.620> now<00:02:40.010> I'm<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.579> gonna

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
water and power so now I'm just gonna

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
water and power so now I'm just gonna
use<00:02:41.060> cotton<00:02:41.840> because<00:02:42.079> our<00:02:42.530> clothing<00:02:42.799> is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
use cotton because our clothing is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.060 
use cotton because our clothing is
normally<00:02:43.489> quite<00:02:43.700> slower<00:02:44.030> with<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.390> kids<00:02:44.630> and
