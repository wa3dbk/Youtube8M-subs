00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.110
 the devices of details such as the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.460
 the phantom and the in spire are almost 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.019
 delivered ready to fly 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 you only need a few small ones 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.219
 to do things like the battery 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 to load and assemble the propellers 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.360
 but one of the most important things that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.680
 you also have to do is the compass 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.780
 calibrate 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.270
 so device always know where the north 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.620
 this is in principle not necessary for each 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.660
 flight 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.460
 are you going to fly further than around 40 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.110
 miles where you put it for the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 the latter calibrates 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.770
 then you have to do it on the spot 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.900
 this is not difficult 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 are you looking for an open space with as little as 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.700
 possibly metal objects or others 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.340
 objects in the neighborhood that can 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 cause malfunctions 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.630
 like to be sure you also briefly 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.160
 keys and your phone from your pocket 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.380
 turn the device on to calibrate 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.579
 first I have this for you 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.530
 done 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 then you activate the calibration 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 offered by the fly scaling and opaque fast forward 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.219
 and moving again 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 you can also start the compass calibration 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.880
 via the app's menu then put 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.440
 just put the remote down and grab it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 turn on the device and straight forward on and 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.360
 you can see the lights on the back 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.680
 whole then turn around you 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 clockwise around your own axis until the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 light shoes become what you do 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.920
 is you tilt the device forward and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.920
 rotate again around your own axis 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.790
 if everything went well then the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.979
 lamp is a rear flashing 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.450
 burn this led lamp is to red then 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.460
 Something went wrong and you should go again 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.439
 recalibrate 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 you doubt if you need to calibrate then you can 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.900
 Of course you always have to be sure 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.900
 do one more time
