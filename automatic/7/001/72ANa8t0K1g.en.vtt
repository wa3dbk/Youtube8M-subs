 a few days but is designed 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.710
 relax no matter what we do 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.520
 Today again random comics each of us 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.010

 now introduce each other and me 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.670
 will run his hope time version 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.710
 so that the end of march is no longer enough 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.489
 and have up to a heavy heart the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.910

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.370
 But stories tell the power supplies 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.690
 the third panel I have to then 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 see for yourself that then almost a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 I find it surprising that it starts 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.499
 so that the blue says to the green 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.050
 Rostock negative person are you one 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.870

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 failed helper gatorade tiger pleased 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.969
 It was really stupid about it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.370
 and then that's never been in one 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.210
 from in the race to comics happening there 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.759

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 special 3 the motto is specialized media 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.350
 Just before the market and everyone 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.899
 Disadvantages are yes it may already be that 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.640
 the third person with wood was seeing 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.159

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.469

 nothing done at all 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.929

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.130
 connection point before the computer 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.010

 the blue is interested in that shit 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.300
 it is a dream 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.310
