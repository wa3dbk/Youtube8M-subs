 step how to do it 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.780
 so I'm not going to do it because 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.399
 I already have a bottle that is full there 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.870
 I'm no longer detangling either so 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.399
 Well, I do not want to finish it for 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.319
 do that knowing that I already have and that 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.219
 my hair so I'll need 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.489
 just tell you what you need 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.140
 make 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.899
 you will take a tablespoon 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.150
 of your good for the hair you go 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.920
 put it in the bowl you will add 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.920
 one to two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.540
 olive that you will add too 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 you will put the lemon juice if 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.290
 you want it to be vinegar or 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 oils and you to mix them with a 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.370
 little bit of water then you have to stir 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 give it back until it becomes 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.920
 homogeneous you put a little bit 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.730
 unfair water for it to become a 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.200
 little liquid and makes you go through with a 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.960
 funnel you are passing your 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 mixture in the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 in your bottle on the pump bottle 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.440
 either the pipit and then you go all 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.070
 just once you have 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.810
 siphon your mixture you go 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.600
 add water over you go 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.190
 all mix well and that will make you your 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.070
 detangling you'll just have to restless one 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.450
 little before using it 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.800
 me personally I really do not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.300
 a lot I put a little one for the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.740
 mane and two or three for the tail 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.080
 and frankly that masters super good 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 and in addition it smells very good I you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.039
 advise to avoid all that is added 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 alcohol-based tricks from balms 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.530
 Hair of the chemical that are too 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.670
 chemical oils or even oils 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 you buy in store jean oil 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.910
 almond stuff like that all 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 was not especially good it's not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.120
 biological stuff sees the stride take 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.709
 bio olive oil is really very 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.209
 well for the fears so here you are 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.030
 can also replace olive oil 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.890
 by castor oil and I know more 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 if you have argan oil it's also 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.900
 one is very expensive so here it is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.800
