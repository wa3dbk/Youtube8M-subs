00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.120 

so<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:05.730> designing<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.299> board<00:00:06.710> no<00:00:07.710> matter<00:00:07.919> what

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
so when designing a board no matter what

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.000 
so when designing a board no matter what
it<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> if<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.910> was<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.360> gonna<00:00:09.510> get<00:00:10.500> given<00:00:10.769> them

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
it is if I was just gonna get given them

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.850 
it is if I was just gonna get given them
forward<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.490> say<00:00:12.269> take<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.259> flavor<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.769> make

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
forward to say take this flavor and make

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.180 
forward to say take this flavor and make
it<00:00:14.009> asymmetrical<00:00:15.680> depending<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it asymmetrical depending on the on the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.029 
it asymmetrical depending on the on the
design<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.699> usually<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> longer<00:00:19.890> rail

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
design but usually it's the longer rail

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
design but usually it's the longer rail
on<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> toe<00:00:20.460> side<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.869> can

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
on the toe side because I think you can

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
on the toe side because I think you can
go<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.350> into<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> flats<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> have

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
go out into the flats and you have

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
go out into the flats and you have
advantage<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.600> leverage<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.170> feet

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
advantage and the leverage of your feet

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
advantage and the leverage of your feet
to<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:26.880> further<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.480> nurse<00:00:27.750> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to get out there further and nurse it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
to get out there further and nurse it
higher<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.910> I'll<00:00:29.910> generally<00:00:30.420> take<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> toe<00:00:31.019> side

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
higher so I'll generally take a toe side

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.810 
higher so I'll generally take a toe side
of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.500> board<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.830> pretty<00:00:32.279> much<00:00:32.399> leave<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
of a board and pretty much leave it the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.160 
of a board and pretty much leave it the
same<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> good

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
same because that really is a good

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
same because that really is a good
reference<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> flavor<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
reference for what the flavor of the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.830 
reference for what the flavor of the
board<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.809> leave<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> toe<00:00:37.410> side<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> same

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
board is so leave the toe side the same

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.590 
board is so leave the toe side the same
I<00:00:39.920> do<00:00:40.920> incorporate<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.610> twisted<00:00:42.059> rocker<00:00:42.300> which

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
I do incorporate a twisted rocker which

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
I do incorporate a twisted rocker which
probably<00:00:43.230> isn't<00:00:43.410> worth<00:00:43.620> explaining<00:00:44.010> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
probably isn't worth explaining but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.690 
probably isn't worth explaining but
that's<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> there<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:48.090> heel<00:00:48.360> side<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.930> will

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
that's in there and the heel side I will

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
that's in there and the heel side I will
fill<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> rail<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.020> reasons<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> think

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
fill up the rail for two reasons I think

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
fill up the rail for two reasons I think
you're<00:00:52.890> heavier<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.550> heel<00:00:53.730> side<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you're heavier on your heel side so I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.090 
you're heavier on your heel side so I
want<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> board<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> sink<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:56.010> bit

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
want the board to sink a little bit

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
want the board to sink a little bit
later<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.539> also<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.230> forgiving

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
later but I also want it more forgiving

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.930 
later but I also want it more forgiving
so<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> fuller<00:00:59.699> rail<00:01:00.770> yeah<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so if I have a fuller rail yeah if I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.440 
so if I have a fuller rail yeah if I
have<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> foot<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> ping-pong<00:01:04.409> ball<00:01:04.650> rail<00:01:05.070> there

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
have a foot a ping-pong ball rail there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.770 
have a foot a ping-pong ball rail there
compared<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:07.770> stop<00:01:08.700> slightly<00:01:09.479> smaller

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
compared to this stop slightly smaller

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
compared to this stop slightly smaller
ping-pong<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.650> rail<00:01:10.920> I'll<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> more

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
ping-pong but down rail I'll have more

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
ping-pong but down rail I'll have more
sensitivity<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> down<00:01:13.080> rail<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> surf

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
sensitivity on the down rail to surf

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
sensitivity on the down rail to surf
more<00:01:13.860> accurately<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.490> when<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.880> into<00:01:15.030> my

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
more accurately but when I go into my

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
more accurately but when I go into my
heels<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:15.960> weaving<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.530> heel

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
heels or when I'm weaving on my heel

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
heels or when I'm weaving on my heel
side<00:01:16.979> line<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> dig<00:01:18.299> rail<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
side line I'm going to dig rail this I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
side line I'm going to dig rail this I
dig<00:01:19.860> around<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.250> I'll<00:01:20.700> connect<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> dots

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
dig around this I'll connect the dots

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530 
dig around this I'll connect the dots
more<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> better<00:01:23.070> yeah<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> one

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
more so better yeah so I think that one

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880 
more so better yeah so I think that one
of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> biggest<00:01:25.049> changes<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.619> small

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
of the biggest changes in your small

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
of the biggest changes in your small
wave<00:01:26.130> board<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.140> especially<00:01:28.140> backside

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
wave board is if you especially backside

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.719 
wave board is if you especially backside
if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.520> digging

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
if you don't if you're not digging

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
if you don't if you're not digging
around<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.380> gonna

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
around as much right then you're gonna

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.850 
around as much right then you're gonna
love<00:01:31.650> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
love it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.149 
love it
yeah<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.729> long<00:01:33.689> around<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> toes<00:01:34.350> fuller<00:01:34.950> rail

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
yeah so long around the toes fuller rail

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
yeah so long around the toes fuller rail
on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> hill<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> shorter<00:01:36.180> outline<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
on the hill with the shorter outline so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
on the hill with the shorter outline so
one<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> different<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> point

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
one to see the different in the point

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.840 
one to see the different in the point
there<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.299> I've<00:01:42.299> change<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> hillside<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
there and I've change the hillside and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
there and I've change the hillside and
get<00:01:44.850> rid<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> surrealist<00:01:45.630> aww<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.409> if

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
get rid of the surrealist aww because if

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.020 
get rid of the surrealist aww because if
you're<00:01:46.680> standing<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.430> come<00:01:47.880> onto

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you're standing up and you come onto

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.639 
you're standing up and you come onto
your<00:01:48.149> heels<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.750> there's<00:01:48.960> no<00:01:49.079> board<00:01:49.409> right

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your heels if there's no board right

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
your heels if there's no board right
here<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.070> quadrant<00:01:50.509> you're<00:01:51.509> gonna<00:01:51.600> come

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
here in this quadrant you're gonna come

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.819 
here in this quadrant you're gonna come
around<00:01:51.930> sooner<00:01:52.380> yeah

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
now with that extra weight from the how

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.030 
now with that extra weight from the how
your<00:01:55.470> body's<00:01:55.680> working

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
your body's working

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.920 
your body's working
you<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.119> weight<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> add<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you got more weight to add into that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.270 
you got more weight to add into that
city<00:01:58.320> maze<00:01:58.500> I'll<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> board<00:01:59.070> come

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
city maze I'll have the board come

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.440 
city maze I'll have the board come
around<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> then<00:01:59.790> when<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.090> back<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> your

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
around and then when you go back to your

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
around and then when you go back to your
toes<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> time<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> nurse<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
toes you have the time to nurse it in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
toes you have the time to nurse it in
and<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.360> cousin<00:02:03.799> would<00:02:04.799> like

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and out and you know cousin would like

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
and out and you know cousin would like
to<00:02:05.070> pledge<00:02:05.250> oh<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.840> moving<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> scene<00:02:07.710> of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
to pledge oh and moving the scene of

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.979 
to pledge oh and moving the scene of
reference<00:02:08.160> over<00:02:08.340> one's<00:02:08.550> ankle<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> had<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
reference over one's ankle so if I had a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
reference over one's ankle so if I had a
board<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> stringer<00:02:10.739> in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
board of the stringer in

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.089 
board of the stringer in
move<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> string<00:02:12.330> over<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> ankle<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.920> it's

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
move that string over the ankle if it's

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.910 
move that string over the ankle if it's
a<00:02:14.190> thruster<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:15.120> pivotal<00:02:15.510> thrust<00:02:16.050> ofin<00:02:16.410> over

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
a thruster that pivotal thrust ofin over

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.800 
a thruster that pivotal thrust ofin over
the<00:02:17.010> ankle<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> single<00:02:18.030> thing<00:02:18.180> over<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the ankle it's a single thing over the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.130 
the ankle it's a single thing over the
ankle<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.950> twin<00:02:20.720> move<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.870> real<00:02:22.020> estate

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
ankle if it's a twin move in real estate

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
ankle if it's a twin move in real estate
so<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.770> pivotal<00:02:23.610> reference<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so that it's pivotal reference if it's a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.390 
so that it's pivotal reference if it's a
V<00:02:24.690> bottom<00:02:25.050> whatever<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> center<00:02:26.099> part<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.340> the

V bottom whatever the center part of the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.979 
V bottom whatever the center part of the
design<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.150> rid<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.390> seen<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.660> put<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.900> up

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
design is get rid of seen to put it up

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.979
