technique actually helped sets the brow

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.770 
technique actually helped sets the brow
from<00:04:20.340> melting<00:04:21.340> lining<00:04:21.700> flying<00:04:22.300> all<00:04:22.480> over<00:04:22.660> the

place<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.230> conceal<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.800> will<00:04:23.950> kind<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.280> act<00:04:24.430> as

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
place to conceal it will kind of act as

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.740 
place to conceal it will kind of act as
a<00:04:24.940> barrier<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.190> product<00:04:27.940> stays<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.480> place

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
a barrier so the product stays in place
