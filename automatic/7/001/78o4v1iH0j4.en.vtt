kind of didn't want to do it because I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.490 
kind of didn't want to do it because I
thought<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:59.240> but

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
thought kind of think it's a little but

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.179 
thought kind of think it's a little but
just<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.619> you'll<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:02.180> what's<00:02:03.180> happening<00:02:03.600> um

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
just so you'll know what's happening um

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
just so you'll know what's happening um
so<00:02:05.189> yeah<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.490> changed<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.880> wires<00:02:06.500> they

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so yeah they changed my wires they

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.119 
so yeah they changed my wires they
didn't

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
didn't

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.670 
didn't
put<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> bracket<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.509> tooth<00:02:10.749> that<00:02:11.079> was<00:02:11.379> a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
put a bracket on that tooth that was a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.319 
put a bracket on that tooth that was a
tooth<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.189> was<00:02:12.280> supposed<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.730> be<00:02:12.879> pulled<00:02:13.150> I

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
tooth that was supposed to be pulled I

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.509 
tooth that was supposed to be pulled I
mentioned<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.749> in<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> last<00:02:14.139> video<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.430> was

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
mentioned it in the last video it was

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.520 
mentioned it in the last video it was
supposed<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.849> be<00:02:15.969> pulled<00:02:16.209> but<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.290> dentist

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
supposed to be pulled but the dentist

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.410 
supposed to be pulled but the dentist
ended<00:02:17.859> up<00:02:17.980> filling<00:02:18.219> the<00:02:18.459> cavity<00:02:18.670> instead<00:02:19.209> so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
ended up filling the cavity instead so

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.640 
ended up filling the cavity instead so
I'm<00:02:19.510> guessing<00:02:19.900> at<00:02:20.019> some<00:02:20.200> point<00:02:20.409> they're<00:02:20.560> gonna

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
I'm guessing at some point they're gonna

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.069 
I'm guessing at some point they're gonna
put<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.159> bracket<00:02:21.609> on<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.939> but<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:22.930> right<00:02:23.019> now

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
put a bracket on that but for right now

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.530 
put a bracket on that but for right now
they<00:02:23.379> just<00:02:23.650> put<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.579> wire<00:02:24.790> over<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.209> because<00:02:25.359> it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
they just put a wire over it because it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.369 
they just put a wire over it because it
didn't<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:25.900> wire<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.469> it<00:02:26.590> before<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:28.379> that's

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
didn't have wire on it before and that's

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.330 
didn't have wire on it before and that's
the<00:02:29.620> tooth<00:02:29.859> that<00:02:30.359> had<00:02:31.359> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.569> pulled<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:35.340> at

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the tooth that had to be pulled and at

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.709 
the tooth that had to be pulled and at
some<00:02:36.639> point<00:02:36.849> I'm<00:02:37.000> guessing<00:02:37.359> they'll<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.689> a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
some point I'm guessing they'll put a

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.569 
some point I'm guessing they'll put a
bracket<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.139> that<00:02:38.379> tooth<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.889> it<00:02:39.069> will<00:02:39.340> move

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
bracket on that tooth and it will move

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.879 
bracket on that tooth and it will move
forward<00:02:40.359> to<00:02:40.480> replace<00:02:41.639> that<00:02:42.639> ginormous<00:02:42.939> space

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
forward to replace that ginormous space

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.830 
forward to replace that ginormous space
what<00:02:44.889> else<00:02:45.040> happened<00:02:45.400> oh<00:02:45.519> these<00:02:46.209> are<00:02:46.599> aware

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
what else happened oh these are aware

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.479 
what else happened oh these are aware
sorry<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:47.799> trying<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.159> look<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.400> my

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
sorry I'm trying to look at my

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.740 
sorry I'm trying to look at my
reflection<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:48.969> know<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.180> looks<00:02:49.329> weird

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
reflection I know it looks weird

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.250 
reflection I know it looks weird
these<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.590> where<00:02:50.859> she<00:02:51.459> had<00:02:51.669> the<00:02:52.090> little<00:02:52.269> bands

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
these are where she had the little bands

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.599 
these are where she had the little bands
around<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.919> there's<00:02:54.069> some<00:02:54.219> of<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> ones<00:02:54.519> on

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
around and there's some of the ones on

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.709 
around and there's some of the ones on
the<00:02:54.730> bottom<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:55.060> can't<00:02:55.299> really<00:02:55.419> tell<00:02:55.659> what

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
the bottom I can't really tell what

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.339 
the bottom I can't really tell what
tunes<00:02:56.169> now<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> know<00:02:57.370> definitely<00:02:57.669> those

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
tunes now but I know definitely those

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.110 
tunes now but I know definitely those
and<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.980> last<00:03:00.219> video<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.939> mentioned

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and in the last video I mentioned

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.479 
and in the last video I mentioned
something<00:03:01.900> about<00:03:01.959> spaces<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.040> how<00:03:03.189> I<00:03:03.219> have

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
something about spaces and how I have

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.220 
something about spaces and how I have
like<00:03:03.760> all<00:03:03.879> these<00:03:04.030> impromptu<00:03:04.599> gaps<00:03:04.870> where<00:03:05.199> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
like all these impromptu gaps where I

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.309 
like all these impromptu gaps where I
didn't<00:03:05.439> have<00:03:05.469> gaps<00:03:05.969> here's<00:03:06.969> one<00:03:07.269> I'm<00:03:08.019> sure<00:03:08.199> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
didn't have gaps here's one I'm sure you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.129 
didn't have gaps here's one I'm sure you
can<00:03:08.469> see<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.769> line<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:10.060> well<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.750> this

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
can see that line really well and this

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.289 
can see that line really well and this
is<00:03:11.319> another<00:03:11.620> line<00:03:11.859> no<00:03:12.159> like<00:03:12.370> yeah<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:14.280> yeah

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
is another line no like yeah so yeah

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.860 
is another line no like yeah so yeah
ready<00:03:16.299> for<00:03:16.479> that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
ready for that

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.800 
ready for that
because<00:03:17.379> that<00:03:17.739> space<00:03:18.009> wasn't<00:03:18.489> there<00:03:18.609> before

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
because that space wasn't there before

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.330 
because that space wasn't there before
so<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.870> feel<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.109> little<00:03:20.290> paranoid<00:03:20.979> about<00:03:21.189> it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
so I feel a little paranoid about it

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.759 
so I feel a little paranoid about it
when<00:03:21.459> people<00:03:22.079> when<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> talk<00:03:23.199> to<00:03:23.470> people<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
when people when I talk to people and

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.800 
when people when I talk to people and
I'm<00:03:23.889> smiling<00:03:24.159> and<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:24.970> feel<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:25.299> now<00:03:25.479> when<00:03:25.780> I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
I'm smiling and I feel like now when I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.390 
I'm smiling and I feel like now when I
talk<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.229> people<00:03:26.349> they're<00:03:26.739> not<00:03:26.859> looking<00:03:27.040> me<00:03:27.370> in

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
talk to people they're not looking me in

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
talk to people they're not looking me in
the<00:03:27.549> eye<00:03:27.669> they're<00:03:27.939> looking<00:03:28.209> at<00:03:28.299> my<00:03:28.419> mouth<00:03:28.569> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the eye they're looking at my mouth and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.830 
the eye they're looking at my mouth and
I<00:03:29.049> feel<00:03:29.259> super<00:03:30.099> paranoid<00:03:30.509> probably<00:03:31.509> they're

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
I feel super paranoid probably they're

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.330 
I feel super paranoid probably they're
not<00:03:32.019> looking<00:03:32.169> at<00:03:32.439> my<00:03:32.650> mouth<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.069> feel<00:03:33.220> like

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
not looking at my mouth but I feel like

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.189 
not looking at my mouth but I feel like
they<00:03:33.459> are<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.259> yeah<00:03:35.259> that's<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.979> jam<00:03:36.509> at<00:03:37.509> some

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
they are so yeah that's a jam at some

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.949 
they are so yeah that's a jam at some
point<00:03:38.409> that<00:03:38.799> will<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.699> a<00:03:39.729> bracket<00:03:39.970> I'm<00:03:40.180> sure

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.610 

yeah<00:03:43.959> that's<00:03:44.829> all<00:03:45.509> nothing<00:03:46.620> groundbreaking

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
yeah that's all nothing groundbreaking

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.550 
yeah that's all nothing groundbreaking
but<00:03:48.659> it'll<00:03:49.659> be<00:03:49.750> interesting<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.169> see<00:03:50.259> over<00:03:50.409> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
but it'll be interesting to see over the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.309 
but it'll be interesting to see over the
next<00:03:50.620> couple<00:03:51.129> hours<00:03:51.669> days<00:03:52.389> how<00:03:52.719> this<00:03:52.930> new<00:03:53.079> wire

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
next couple hours days how this new wire
