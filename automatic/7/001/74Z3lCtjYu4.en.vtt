back<00:01:42.880> with<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.150> white<00:01:43.270> face<00:01:43.480> paint<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930

the red designs that are on my forehead

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.770 
the red designs that are on my forehead
I<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.890> mix<00:01:51.159> Wolf's<00:01:51.610> white<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.149> yellow<00:01:52.420> face

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
I then mix Wolf's white and yellow face

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.840 
I then mix Wolf's white and yellow face
paint<00:01:53.079> together<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:54.039> create<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:54.549> color

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
paint together and I create this color

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.730 
paint together and I create this color
that<00:01:54.969> I<00:01:55.180> used<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.570> paint<00:01:55.780> on<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.259> teeth<00:01:56.469> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
that I used to paint on the teeth and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.969 
that I used to paint on the teeth and
then<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.640> mix<00:01:58.149> black<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.810> red<00:01:59.409> face<00:01:59.649> paint

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
then I mix black and red face paint

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.649 
then I mix black and red face paint
together<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.640> create<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> perfect<00:02:01.210> red<00:02:01.630> I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
together to create the perfect red I

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.889 
together to create the perfect red I
need<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.289> paint<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.890> gums<00:02:03.509> paint<00:02:04.509> some<00:02:04.750> of

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
need to paint on the gums paint some of

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.960 
need to paint on the gums paint some of
the<00:02:05.079> gums<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.860> lean<00:02:06.130> more<00:02:06.159> on<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.579> red<00:02:06.729> side

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the gums to lean more on the red side

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.029 
the gums to lean more on the red side
and<00:02:07.270> some<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.689> lean<00:02:07.929> more<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.560> black<00:02:08.709> site

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
and some to lean more on the black site

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.440 
and some to lean more on the black site
so<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.399> will<00:02:09.580> give<00:02:09.700> dimension<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.330> look

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
so this will give dimension to the look

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.089 
so this will give dimension to the look
and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.959> use<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> black<00:02:11.349> face<00:02:11.739> needs<00:02:11.980> to

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
and then use the black face needs to

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.160 
and then use the black face needs to
start<00:02:12.310> painting<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.120> inside<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> mouth

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
start painting the inside of the mouth

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.190 
start painting the inside of the mouth
and<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.560> also<00:02:14.739> use<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.099> black<00:02:15.280> face<00:02:15.640> paint<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and I also use that black face paint to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.600 
and I also use that black face paint to
outline<00:02:17.200> each<00:02:17.470> edge<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.849> gums<00:02:20.370> make<00:02:21.370> sure

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
outline each edge of the gums make sure

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.550 
outline each edge of the gums make sure
the<00:02:21.790> inside<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> mouth<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.930> darkest<00:02:23.380> on

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the inside of the mouth is darkest on

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.070 
the inside of the mouth is darkest on
the<00:02:23.739> outer<00:02:23.950> corner<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.420> way<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.900> will

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the outer corner and that way this will

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.600 
the outer corner and that way this will
give<00:02:26.200> dimension<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.890> look<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.250> make<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
give dimension to the look and make it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.630 
give dimension to the look and make it
look<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.239> little<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:29.019> more<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:29.980> depth<00:02:30.370> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
look a little bit more like in depth and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.900 
look a little bit more like in depth and
realistic<00:02:31.599> rather<00:02:31.989> than<00:02:32.200> such<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> flat<00:02:33.160> face

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030 
realistic rather than such a flat face
painting<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.540> now<00:02:35.079> I'm<00:02:35.200> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.650> go<00:02:35.799> back

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
little just strokes around it I used the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.120 
little just strokes around it I used the
gray<00:02:55.329> face<00:02:55.600> paint<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.049> shade<00:02:56.380> my<00:02:56.410> teeth<00:02:56.859> and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
gray face paint to shade my teeth and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.740 
gray face paint to shade my teeth and
then<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.459> use<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.790> black<00:02:57.970> face<00:02:58.329> paint<00:02:58.690> to

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
then I use the black face paint to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.289 
then I use the black face paint to
outline<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.380> red<00:02:59.500> designs<00:02:59.889> I<00:03:00.280> decided<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.180> do

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
outline the red designs I decided to do

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.420 
outline the red designs I decided to do
this<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:01.540> I'm<00:03:01.959> not<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.410> big<00:03:02.680> fan<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.250> just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
this because I'm not a big fan of just

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.910 
this because I'm not a big fan of just
having<00:03:03.609> flat<00:03:03.970> colors<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.720> my<00:03:04.810> looks<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.709> black

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
having flat colors in my looks the black

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920 
having flat colors in my looks the black
helps<00:03:06.220> complement<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> red<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.420> helps<00:03:07.750> it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
helps complement the red and helps it

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.069 
helps complement the red and helps it
stand<00:03:08.290> out<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.950> next<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.850> use<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.420> yellow<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
stand out and next I use a yellow and

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.680 
stand out and next I use a yellow and
gray<00:03:11.440> eyeshadow<00:03:11.650> from<00:03:12.100> BH<00:03:12.430> Cosmetics<00:03:12.730> to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
gray eyeshadow from BH Cosmetics to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.229 
gray eyeshadow from BH Cosmetics to
shave<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.109> top<00:03:14.139> portion<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:15.190> each<00:03:15.579> tooth

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
shave the top portion of each tooth

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.360 
shave the top portion of each tooth
shading<00:03:17.109> is<00:03:17.230> very<00:03:17.470> important<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.160> teeth

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
shading is very important for the teeth

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.510 
shading is very important for the teeth
it<00:03:18.579> helps<00:03:18.880> them<00:03:19.090> appear<00:03:19.450> more<00:03:19.660> realistic

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
it helps them appear more realistic

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120 
it helps them appear more realistic
finally<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.480> used<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.260> white<00:03:23.380> facepaint<00:03:23.740> to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
finally I used the white facepaint to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.100 
finally I used the white facepaint to
create<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:24.490> little<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.030> saliva<00:03:25.450> marks<00:03:25.900> from

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
create a little like saliva marks from

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.260 
create a little like saliva marks from
the<00:03:26.230> inside<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.800> mouth
