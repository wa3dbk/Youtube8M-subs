i took using my mobile phone quite have
quite<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.170> neat<00:00:44.380> thing<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.800> how<00:00:45.130> st.<00:00:45.730> marks<00:00:45.940> road

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
quite a neat thing of how st. marks road

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.450 
quite a neat thing of how st. marks road
looks<00:00:46.390> like<00:00:46.630> in<00:00:46.870> bangalore<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.800> how<00:00:54.010> it

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
looks like in bangalore that's how it

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.970 
looks like in bangalore that's how it
sounds<00:00:54.850> like<00:00:55.000> when<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.600> go<00:00:55.750> in<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.960> wreck<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:56.530> I

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
sounds like when I go in the wreck but I

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.620 
sounds like when I go in the wreck but I
think<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:57.610> what<00:00:57.760> we<00:00:57.880> can<00:00:58.000> do<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.420> try<00:00:58.600> to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
think so what we can do is that try to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.420 
think so what we can do is that try to
make<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:58.900> even<00:00:59.080> more<00:00:59.200> professional<00:00:59.950> on<00:01:00.070> top<00:01:00.280> of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
make it even more professional on top of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.130 
make it even more professional on top of
this<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:00.790> let<00:01:00.910> me<00:01:01.000> just<00:01:01.150> import<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.930> odd<00:01:07.930> you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
this so let me just import and odd you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:19.499 
this so let me just import and odd you
also<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.950> top<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:17.280> cool<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.429> think<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:18.789> uh<00:01:18.819> so

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
also on top of it cool I think so uh so

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.239 
also on top of it cool I think so uh so
quickly<00:01:19.960> what<00:01:20.319> you<00:01:20.439> can<00:01:20.649> do<00:01:20.799> is<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.009> can

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
quickly what you can do is that you can

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.160 
quickly what you can do is that you can
transform<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.819> video<00:01:22.179> which<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.420> like<00:01:22.719> which

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
transform a video which is like which

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.429 
transform a video which is like which
was<00:01:23.399> quite<00:01:24.450> unprofessional<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.020> then<00:01:26.200> now<00:01:26.380> we

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
was quite unprofessional and then now we

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.889 
was quite unprofessional and then now we
have<00:01:26.799> something<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.639> looks<00:01:28.509> looks

more spice to this so let me just add
assume<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.789> gotta<00:01:37.030> go<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.420> show<00:01:37.929> this

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
assume that you gotta go and show this

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.590 
assume that you gotta go and show this
same<00:01:38.859> video<00:01:39.069> maybe<00:01:39.369> 25<00:01:39.850> years<00:01:40.090> hence<00:01:40.329> forth

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
same video maybe 25 years hence forth

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:54.410 
same video maybe 25 years hence forth
how<00:01:41.109> would<00:01:41.289> send<00:01:41.560> much<00:01:41.709> would<00:01:41.920> look<00:01:42.100> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.810 

so<00:01:55.420> ah<00:01:55.720> yeah<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.860> looks<00:01:57.100> pretty<00:01:57.190> neat<00:01:57.490> i<00:01:57.520> think

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
so ah yeah it looks pretty neat i think

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.520 
so ah yeah it looks pretty neat i think
so<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.630> go<00:01:58.810> back<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:58.990> say<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.380> here

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
so you can go back and say that here

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.060 
so you can go back and say that here
maybe<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.659> 2010<00:02:01.659> or<00:02:01.900> 2005<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.800> how<00:02:02.920> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
maybe not 2010 or 2005 this is how it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.160 
maybe not 2010 or 2005 this is how it
looked<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.550> let's<00:02:04.210> go<00:02:04.479> back<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.900> then<00:02:05.020> say

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
looked like let's go back and then say

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.380 
looked like let's go back and then say
that<00:02:05.320> hey<00:02:05.470> how<00:02:05.710> would<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.979> have<00:02:06.970> looked<00:02:07.000> in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
that hey how would it have looked in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:18.530 
that hey how would it have looked in
19th<00:02:07.750> century<00:02:08.190> 1950s<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.399> here<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.240> go

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.720 

so<00:02:19.560> quickly<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:21.310> do<00:02:21.700> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
so quickly you can see that we can do a

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.220 
so quickly you can see that we can do a
whole<00:02:21.819> bunch<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.330> transformations<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:22.989> we

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
whole bunch of transformations that we

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040 
whole bunch of transformations that we
really<00:02:23.500> want<00:02:23.910> let's<00:02:24.910> look<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.360> also<00:02:25.870> from

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
really want let's look at it also from

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.170 
really want let's look at it also from
in<00:02:26.140> different<00:02:26.440> coloring<00:02:27.099> scheme<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.580> assume

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
in different coloring scheme like assume

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.449 
in different coloring scheme like assume
that<00:02:28.360> Mumbai<00:02:28.750> looks<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.260> bit<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.830> green<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
that Mumbai looks a bit of green so

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:44.070 
that Mumbai looks a bit of green so
let's<00:02:31.390> hit<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:31.989> again

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.290 

so<00:02:45.080> cool<00:02:45.260> up<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.190> anybody<00:02:46.760> would<00:02:47.030> fall<00:02:47.270> for

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
so cool up so anybody would fall for

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.930 
so cool up so anybody would fall for
that<00:02:47.540> because<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.160> color<00:02:49.370> schemes<00:02:49.700> looks

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
that because the the color schemes looks

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.460 
that because the the color schemes looks
