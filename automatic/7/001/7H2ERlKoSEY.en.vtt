 hello i am maria 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.710
 expert m video with pleasure 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.440
 I present you a patented vacuum cleaner 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 cyclone technology dyson kinetic 10 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.820
 52 animal complet by the way in 2014 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 this particular model was named product 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 years, let's find out why so 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 the name suggests such an assistant 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 especially useful for the owner of fluffy 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.149
 54 cyclone friends with vibrating 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.129
 tips provide high 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 cleaning efficiency and without 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.449
 requires no consumables and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 filter maintenance is worth noting that 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.089
 thanks to such effective work 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.010
 cyclones vacuum cleaners dyson kinetic never 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.859
 does not lose suction power 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.129
 thanks to the unique kinetic technology 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.449
 cyclones are able to catch 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.559
 microscopic dust particles sized 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.319
 up to 1 300 human hair thickness 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 such as pollen mold and even bacteria 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:05.790
 and the tightness of the parts and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.850
 high quality output filter 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 fine cleaning do not release them back into 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.220
 rooms outgoing air from the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.410
 It turns out much cleaner than you 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 with you is usually higher according to 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.110
 research but all this theory let's 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.480
 let's go to practice and immediately to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.720
 features included is very 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.140
 interesting set of nozzles in turbo brushes 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.870
 combines anti-static bristles from 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 carbon fiber and nylon which 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.180
 allows you to easily clean as 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.360
 delicate lacquered parquet and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.270
 carpet even the season 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 design not not turbo brushes for soft 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 of furniture 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.930
 interferes with reeling swamp 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.910
 wool 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.470
 so you don't have to disassemble 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.470
 brush to eliminate tangled 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 garbage included also comes 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.920
 low profile nozzle for solids 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.090
 coatings which greatly facilitates 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.730
 cleaning under furniture 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.210
 notice it moves by itself 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.610
 a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.490
 he follows you does not hold down 2 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 They and thanks to technology ball vacuum 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.600
 has a low center of gravity what does 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.600
 vacuum cleaner more sustainable and at the same time 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 very maneuverable less effort when 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 more efficient cleaning is a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.380
 Dyson and him Complit high technology 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.320
 on guard 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.250
 on this i say goodbye to you hope this 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.200
 the review was helpful to you and the video on me is all 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.200
 equally
