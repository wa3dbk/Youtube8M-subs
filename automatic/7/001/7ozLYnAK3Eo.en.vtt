00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
into it so the first map we have here is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
into it so the first map we have here is
smugglers<00:00:46.170> cove<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.980> sure<00:00:47.039> why<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.460> says

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

smugglers cove I'm not sure why it says
Angel<00:00:48.030> City<00:00:48.210> attrition<00:00:48.829> probably<00:00:49.829> because

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Angel City attrition probably because

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
Angel City attrition probably because
those<00:00:50.460> were<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:50.850> two<00:00:50.969> maps<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> beta

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
those were the only two maps in the beta

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
those were the only two maps in the beta
and<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> names

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and they don't actually have the names

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
and they don't actually have the names
on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> maps<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:55.230> worry

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
on the maps but so don't don't worry

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
on the maps but so don't don't worry

which<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.320> beautiful<00:01:22.320> map<00:01:22.770> from

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
which looks like a beautiful map from

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
which looks like a beautiful map from
this<00:01:23.610> screen<00:01:24.210> shot<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.020> can't<00:01:25.409> wait<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this screen shot here I can't wait to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
this screen shot here I can't wait to
play<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.450> next<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.840> have

play that actually the next one we have
outpost<00:01:28.470> 207<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.250> looks<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.729> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
outpost 207 which looks like it's in

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.469 
outpost 207 which looks like it's in
space<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.409> something<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.479> kind

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
space you can see something there kind

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
space you can see something there kind
of<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> satellite<00:01:34.079> type<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.070> gun

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
