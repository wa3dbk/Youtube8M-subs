pressurize<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.170> try<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.100> jump<00:03:12.520> out<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
pressurize and try to jump out of the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.330 
pressurize and try to jump out of the
top<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.420> usually<00:03:14.050> open<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.530> top<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.860> my<00:03:14.950> blender
