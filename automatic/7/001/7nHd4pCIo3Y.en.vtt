permanently<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.789> key<00:01:46.030> to

everyday life so before I started it has

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.959 
everyday life so before I started it has
been<00:01:55.840> known<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.439> an<00:01:56.679> inhibition<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.700> brain

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
been known that an inhibition in a brain

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.380 
been known that an inhibition in a brain
can<00:01:58.570> be<00:01:59.009> constantly<00:02:00.009> modified<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:01.030> like<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
can be constantly modified just like the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.830 
can be constantly modified just like the
excitatory<00:02:01.899> connections<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.640> what<00:02:04.479> genes

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
excitatory connections but what genes

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200 
excitatory connections but what genes
and<00:02:05.170> what<00:02:05.319> pathways<00:02:05.859> are<00:02:06.130> important<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
and what pathways are important for the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.690 
and what pathways are important for the
modification<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:08.050> inhibition<00:02:08.710> is<00:02:08.890> relatively

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
modification of inhibition is relatively

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.890 
modification of inhibition is relatively
unknown<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.200> that's<00:02:11.890> why<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.190> decided<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
unknown so that's why I decided to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.770 
unknown so that's why I decided to
tackle<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:14.890> problem<00:02:15.220> by<00:02:15.580> identify<00:02:16.210> new

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
tackle this problem by identify new

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780 
tackle this problem by identify new
genes<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.380> pathways<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:18.160> are<00:02:18.220> important

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
genes and pathways that are important

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.170 
genes and pathways that are important
for<00:02:19.560> modification<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.680> inhibition<00:02:21.550> so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
for modification of inhibition so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.420 
for modification of inhibition so
we<00:02:22.329> have<00:02:22.480> found<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.140> genetic<00:02:23.530> program

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
we have found a genetic program

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.789 
we have found a genetic program

called<00:02:26.829> em<00:02:27.340> pass<00:02:27.609> for<00:02:27.969> that's<00:02:28.750> important<00:02:29.500> for

called em pass for that's important for
