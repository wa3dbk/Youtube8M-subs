00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.099
 fair 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 here in this election we will learn 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.760
 the 2002 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.750
 among them 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 and there will also be a hype using this 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.880
 Manuela Sáenz 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.520
 the montuno in the priísmo 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.650
 particular that has 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.539
 i 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.539
 it is basically used 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.690
 at the time you can do the injuries 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 How is it going 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.580
 as you like to be 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 in the song you want 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 this can also be another version 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 economic is to be a writer 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.210
 just there 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 an without your phone number 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 mainly title 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 because to start 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.120
 this this 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120
 another particular technique this idea 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.200
 this 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 tijuana so that he does not 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 this goal 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.579
 F sharp minor 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.359
 yes greater 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.559
 and then the movement continues 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.559
 Mr 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.149
 well by the bands for it 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.699
 or sra 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
 a year ago 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.869
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.289
 add the sauce 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 try it fear 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.499
 because there are to practice a good 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.059
 if they do not manage to do it then with preceded that is very good is asaja not 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.359
 that a previous decision will follow 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.029
 to the sauce 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 and then he was very good 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.769
 since they achieved this movement goes for more doing it or vox 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 does the variations 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.569
 these variations are 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.569
 let's use none 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.629
 operative 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.629
 we made a semitone 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 that's what we're going to do on this tape according to 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.839
 I hope you put the habits 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.479
 he fixes well 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.479
 that when they already have pensions and they join 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.529
 seen the practice all you have to do is 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.529
 in doing the same was the stage of the song 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.199
 now what depends on you is he speaks if that other than a san mamés 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.930
 because what speed depends 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.139
 gt like this 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.139
 how the song tortures you 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.460
 when they start 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.279
 to know a little more than tobarra improvised 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.150
 the soul ladder 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.400
 even exams 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.969
 Carla without any problem 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.799
 and good that it would be the end of
