00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
unclogging a toilet can be difficult to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.170 
unclogging a toilet can be difficult to
do<00:00:10.680> especially<00:00:11.040> if<00:00:11.430> you<00:00:11.580> don't<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:12.000> lot<00:00:12.150> of

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
going to go actually is going to be in

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.240 
going to go actually is going to be in
the<00:01:17.540> bottom<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> toilet<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.130> going

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
to have to go up here around and down

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270 
to have to go up here around and down
it's<00:01:25.340> long<00:01:25.729> enough<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.240> do<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:28.220> is

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
it's long enough to do that but this is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.190 
it's long enough to do that but this is
why<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:28.700> harder<00:01:29.270> for<00:01:29.299> a<00:01:29.509> woman<00:01:29.600> who<00:01:30.020> doesn't

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
why it's harder for a woman who doesn't

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.249 
why it's harder for a woman who doesn't
have<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:30.470> much<00:01:30.649> strength<00:01:31.009> as<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.280> guy<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:32.600> get

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
have as much strength as a guy to get

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.910 
have as much strength as a guy to get
this<00:01:33.500> auger<00:01:34.000> all<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.360> way<00:01:35.539> in<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.710> all<00:01:36.829> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
way around it just it just takes a

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.740 
way around it just it just takes a
little<00:01:39.439> doing<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:40.460> order<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.939> do<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.179> but<00:01:41.390> I'm

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the this part that is more coiled inside

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.850 
the this part that is more coiled inside

you can put your hand back on the handle

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.949

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
sometimes I don't have enough strength

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.920 
sometimes I don't have enough strength
to<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.269> really<00:02:47.569> have<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.900> show

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
to do that and I really have to show

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.069

shove<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.980> thing<00:02:49.220> in<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.640> toilet<00:02:50.090> first<00:02:50.389> and

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
shove the thing in the toilet first and

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.080 
shove the thing in the toilet first and
once<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.769> handle<00:02:52.160> down<00:02:52.310> then<00:02:52.910> you

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
once you get the handle down then you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.770 
once you get the handle down then you
can<00:02:53.120> crank<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.989> one<00:02:54.859> direction<00:02:55.269> then<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.540> crank

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
can crank it one direction then to crank

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.490 
can crank it one direction then to crank
it<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.049> other<00:02:57.260> direction<00:02:58.180> okay<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.540> you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
it the other direction okay and you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.740 
it the other direction okay and you
never<00:03:00.709> want<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.340> pull<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.030> plastic<00:03:02.269> out

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
never want to just pull the plastic out

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.319 
never want to just pull the plastic out
and<00:03:03.079> then<00:03:03.889> pull<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.370> metal<00:03:04.579> out<00:03:04.819> because<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
and then pull the metal out because the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.080 
and then pull the metal out because the
metal<00:03:05.569> will<00:03:05.840> scratch<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.560> toilet<00:03:07.069> inside<00:03:07.489> so

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
metal will scratch the toilet inside so

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.319 
metal will scratch the toilet inside so
what<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.450> want<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.170> pull<00:03:10.099> back<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.819> this

what you want to do is pull back on this

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.099 
what you want to do is pull back on this
