this<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.290> building<00:02:18.530> up<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.860> decks<00:02:19.069> territory

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
this is building up the decks territory

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.210 
this is building up the decks territory
if<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.849> can<00:02:19.970> keep<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.420> fingers<00:02:21.049> down<00:02:21.290> at

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
if you can keep all your fingers down at

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.040 
if you can keep all your fingers down at
the<00:02:22.340> same<00:02:22.579> time

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.640 

okay<00:02:25.350> good<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.760> once<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> here<00:02:27.650> he

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
okay good then once you get to here he

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.370 
okay good then once you get to here he
then<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:30.090> scale<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> notes<00:02:31.170> are

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
then go down scale so the notes are

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.500 
then go down scale so the notes are
going<00:02:31.770> down<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:34.250> okay<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
going down so it's okay and then this is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.880 
going down so it's okay and then this is
the<00:02:36.540> part<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.930> beginners<00:02:37.350> will<00:02:37.470> find<00:02:37.710> quite

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the part that beginners will find quite

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.290 
the part that beginners will find quite
difficult<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.400> bring<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.940> fourth<00:02:39.180> finger

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
difficult to bring your fourth finger

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540 
difficult to bring your fourth finger
over<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> B<00:02:40.500> string<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.460> just

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
over to the B string and then you just

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:55.570 
over to the B string and then you just
go<00:02:50.750> k<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:54.090> simple<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.780> quick

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
go k so that is a very simple and quick

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.970 
go k so that is a very simple and quick
warm-up<00:02:56.580> if<00:02:57.270> you're<00:02:57.510> using<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.840> plectrum<00:02:58.380> you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
warm-up if you're using a plectrum you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.580 
warm-up if you're using a plectrum you
should<00:02:59.220> be<00:02:59.430> alternate<00:03:00.300> picking<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:01.290> means

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
should be alternate picking which means

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.700 
should be alternate picking which means
with<00:03:01.770> your<00:03:01.920> plectrum<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.700> down

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
with your plectrum you're going down

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.820 
with your plectrum you're going down
down<00:03:05.450> down<00:03:07.160> down<00:03:08.810> down<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.800> so

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
down down down down and so on and so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.190 
down down down down and so on and so
forth<00:03:11.010> I'm<00:03:11.820> exaggerating<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.630> movement<00:03:13.020> there

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
forth I'm exaggerating a movement there

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.510 
forth I'm exaggerating a movement there
you<00:03:13.260> should<00:03:13.440> keep<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:13.710> collection<00:03:14.130> as<00:03:14.220> close

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
you should keep your collection as close

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.280 
you should keep your collection as close
to<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> strings<00:03:15.090> as<00:03:15.240> possible<00:03:15.660> that's<00:03:16.110> just

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to the strings as possible that's just

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.960 
to the strings as possible that's just
to<00:03:16.380> demonstrate<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.460> down<00:03:17.670> up

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
to demonstrate to you that it's down up

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.740 
to demonstrate to you that it's down up
down<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.890> that's<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.880> quick<00:03:21.270> fingers<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
down up so that's a quick fingers of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.650 
down up so that's a quick fingers of
exercise<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.320> one<00:03:22.560> other<00:03:22.680> quick<00:03:22.950> thing<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
exercise just one other quick thing and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.270 
exercise just one other quick thing and
you<00:03:24.660> should<00:03:24.840> always<00:03:24.990> be<00:03:25.200> playing<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.950> a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
you should always be playing to a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.850 
you should always be playing to a
metronome<00:03:27.180> I've<00:03:27.960> just<00:03:28.140> got<00:03:28.410> mention<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.740> my

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
metronome I've just got mention on my

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.640 
metronome I've just got mention on my
phone<00:03:29.040> s<00:03:29.250> all<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.150> know<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:31.140> I've<00:03:31.440> got<00:03:31.620> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
phone s all I know so I've got a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.020 
phone s all I know so I've got a
metronome<00:03:31.980> set<00:03:32.310> here<00:03:32.550> if<00:03:32.700> you're<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.850> beginner

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
metronome set here if you're a beginner

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.020 
metronome set here if you're a beginner
i<00:03:33.480> recommend<00:03:34.050> 60<00:03:34.470> BPM<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.739> then<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.760> way

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
i recommend 60 BPM and then this way

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.420 
i recommend 60 BPM and then this way
you're<00:03:39.209> keeping<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> steady<00:03:39.900> tempo<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.860> steady

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
you're keeping a steady tempo and steady

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
you're keeping a steady tempo and steady
groove<00:03:41.760> which<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.180> very<00:03:42.570> important<00:03:43.170> as<00:03:43.260> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
groove which is very important as a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:56.640 
groove which is very important as a
musician

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.290 

and<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:57.890> on<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.099> so<00:03:58.160> forth<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.880> same<00:03:59.090> back

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
and so on and so forth in the same back

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.510 
and so on and so forth in the same back
down<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.410> I'm<00:04:00.440> just<00:04:00.680> keeping<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.069> very<00:04:01.220> steady

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
down so I'm just keeping a very steady

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.720 
down so I'm just keeping a very steady
tempo<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.319> beat<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.800> metronome<00:04:04.220> once

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
tempo to the beat of the metronome once

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.220 
tempo to the beat of the metronome once
you<00:04:04.819> get<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.000> little<00:04:05.150> bit<00:04:05.270> more<00:04:05.420> confident<00:04:06.050> with

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
you get a little bit more confident with

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.559 
you get a little bit more confident with
the<00:04:06.380> warm-up<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:07.400> can<00:04:07.610> speed<00:04:07.880> up<00:04:07.910> your<00:04:08.239> turbo

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
the warm-up you can speed up your turbo

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.170 
the warm-up you can speed up your turbo
so<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.840> moment<00:04:09.110> 60<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.340> good<00:04:10.580> start<00:04:10.940> into

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so the moment 60 is a good start into

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.570 
so the moment 60 is a good start into
that<00:04:11.420> 60<00:04:11.840> BPM<00:04:12.350> beats<00:04:12.590> per<00:04:12.860> minute<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.370> then

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
that 60 BPM beats per minute and then

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.940 
that 60 BPM beats per minute and then
you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.880> just<00:04:13.970> sort<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.239> speed<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.600> up<00:04:14.950> so

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
you can just sort of speed it up so

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.730 
you can just sort of speed it up so
everywhere<00:04:16.430> your<00:04:16.700> cobbler<00:04:16.940> with

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.830 

two<00:04:24.740> bits<00:04:24.950> per<00:04:25.340> click<00:04:25.700> click<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.810> just

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
two bits per click click but that just

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.390 
two bits per click click but that just
gives<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.380> an<00:04:27.440> idea<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.980> can<00:04:28.100> speed<00:04:28.370> up

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
gives you an idea that you can speed up

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.740 
gives you an idea that you can speed up
as<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:29.240> get<00:04:29.480> more<00:04:29.870> confident<00:04:31.390> great<00:04:32.390> hope

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
as you get more confident great hope

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.480 
as you get more confident great hope
that's<00:04:32.930> been<00:04:33.050> useful<00:04:33.110> for<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.860> see<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.340> can

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
that's been useful for you see you can

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.700 
that's been useful for you see you can
