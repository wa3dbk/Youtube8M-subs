00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.719
 today I would not like to talk about video I would like 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.940
 talk about photography and a technique 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.940
 particular that really struck me 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.169
 to do this, mine is not enough 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.169
 small room then 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.420
 Well 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.850
 all 'red today we are in the studio and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.630
 we'll see how to take a shot a lot 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.630
 particular 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 this technique is called light painting 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 and practically consists of making gods 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 light drawings that come then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.920
 taken from the basic camera must 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.200
 to be in a completely dark room 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.410
 have a tiny little light hit 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 optical this can set the machine 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.619
 on bold bulb mode valdo therefore 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.460
 bulb believe pronunciation and therefore with 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.200
 this light will have to paint i 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 subjects that want to light up 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 or create real drawings 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.710
 of light this technique is often 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 used for still life or for 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 do things a little more artistic than 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 I call tamarre night light joking 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100
 there are also very nice things 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.130
 still life usually comes 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 used for advertising that I know of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.460
 Fruit wines were those ones 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.770
 still lifes that can be seen from time to time 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.910
 to advertise the chiquita banana 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.259
 here for this kind of thing yes 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.590
 they use still life 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.690
 I wanted to do practically something 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:09.060
 of teasing creates the famous 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:12.690
 hammered out of mail that rightly is there 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.450
 the very famous hammering of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.250
 apples then the number one step was 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.920
 that of creating a cover 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.580
 likely of my apple hammer 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.580
 ee to print it 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.760
 then I cut the edges of mine 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.209
 jam label but yoga 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.209
 apple hammered 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.380
 well 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.380
 of course 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.570
 and of those that the time has come 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.570
 of the shot 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.510
 she 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.920
 with my light or then painted all over 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.920
 how much the surface of the apple 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.010
 then it was time to give the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.049
 hammered and it was the most moment 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.769
 beautiful of my life also because the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.750
 apple just exploded, that is, one thing 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.000
 horrible matinee end that I have anyway 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.010
 wanted to immortalize clearly of 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.489
 taking it at least to 60 fps 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 available on my car 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.859
 lamela has literally exploded that is of 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.829
 I did not expect him to exclude this 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.539
 so much has started in two thousand pieces indeed 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:26.410
 that we wanted to put it back together a little 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:29.110
 to recreate the shot and finally we have 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:34.330
 made the jam shot then at 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.460
 jar of jam this we say 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.889
 that the basic technique to use light 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.830
 painting then there are many creative things 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.910
 that you can do with light painting 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.680
 also directing the light directly 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.540
 inside to inside the objective that goes to 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.360
 impress the sensor cells 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.170
 photosensitive so you can do it 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.170
 also such things 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.960
 well 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.480
 but if exposed 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.480
 a shape 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.530
 I go 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.430
 tell me 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.610
 we also used a flash for this 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.010
 There are a number of things more 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.980
 and exposure times clearly 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.070
 they are beautiful long because you have to create 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.680
 the whole circle around the globe 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.660
 created by this image is however the 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.480
 result is really really 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.730
 particular there is one thing that it still gives 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.890
 much more satisfaction and doing it live 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.930
 which is what to do it on photoshop 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:17.090
 since the result is exactly the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.470
 same thing yes it is true however more 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.870
 satisfaction there is a beautiful one 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.430
 satisfaction speaks from live well 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.680
 I hope this technique can 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.050
 nice that you can have fun in 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.640
 try it and I also hope to see some 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.470
 what if you succeed you want 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.100
 if you want to publish apple trees on mine 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.770
 facebook page in description 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.620
 find everything then publish me less 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:43.520
 in short, I will be very happy to see 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.740
 how and what you experienced if you like 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.720
 and you must go with light painting there 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.240
 they are also very cool jobs at 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.030
 stop motion example that came linko 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.930
 23 in these parts in description and veils 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.640
 link 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.670
 in short, somehow I put them there 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.750
 in short, a very cool second technique 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:06.430
 you could test it yourself too 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.430
 given in the header please type like this 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.940
 that's OK
