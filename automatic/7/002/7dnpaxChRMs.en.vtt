00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello everyone, let's start frying the seeds so 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.040
 little by little I fall asleep but I already have a stove 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.519
 turned on before filming and along the way I their 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.420
 still 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:27.119
 we clean them with any nonsense sep 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:36.570
 these branches are not stepping well, this is 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:42.780
 We take out but all that did everything 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.370
 I must go on, so I’ve fallen asleep 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 we are all roasted 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 and if you listen carefully now! 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 there is a slight clicking on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.789
 us about that constantly by the way on external 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 the walls almost constantly it tells us about 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.390
 that with the maximum fire here I have 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.979
 on 6 I add immediately to the four 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 Do not think for a long time otherwise yours 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.299
 chemical will imperceptible burn it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.420
 burnt roofs turn out complete nonsense 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.540
 so one more tip that I want 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.110
 give when frying seeds do not need 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 add sunflower oil 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 Why do I never understand it? 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.670
 so now for how many years and about this 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.340
 I hear that add some sunflower 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 the mass turns out very tasty why here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 add oil when the seeds are so summit 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.119
 oil is made in fact him oil in Moscow 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 behind 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.380
 I somehow tried to add 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 much difference will not feel the extra 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:01.219
 fats so since we have already gone from seeds 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:03.859
 I’m going to smoke a little more now and 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:10.549
 I put the fire on C grade somewhere I think 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:13.640
 after a minute and a half so passed 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.170
 somewhere and a half two minutes urgently need 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.340
 turn the heat down 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.879
 we know all animals in general, even 4 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 raise see what you nusup below 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:32.180
 Oil seems to hit the pan on 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.120
 always try to take the seed 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.950
 sunflower seed 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:45.910
 constantly trying to constantly interfere 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:49.489
 you expelled seeds are not ready but already 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.590
 fry the color it has inside it 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.170
 says that we are at the maximum 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:02.630
 in no way can it fry the fire 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 they burn all the bullets me in general yes on 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.489
 low heat we bring to that condition 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.410
 the readiness date that you need in no way 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.959
 case on a large magnet there is already a ball 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.750
 otherwise you won't notice it as the dawn 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.740
 You think so many times 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.600
 just fry start need 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:28.290
 That is why on dvoechke on low fire 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:35.580
 slowly slowly we are doing 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:40.790
 fry and stir all the time 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:50.250
 ok, i'm distracted by minus q2 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:53.340
 Further in the hospital so well, all chemical 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:01.830
 I burned now I sprinkle them on clean ones 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:05.570
 so that they are faster than incentive by the way seeds 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.340
 fry need somewhere at 85-90 percent 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.570
 they are hot now they will still 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.040
 prepare in this mode and 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:19.350
 reach this condition which we need 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.710
 All by the way, the window is open in the kitchen 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.820
 and then there is smoke all the time I open 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.490
 moved on while frying a lot but everything 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.440
 seeds are fried 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.440
 bon appetit to all bye
