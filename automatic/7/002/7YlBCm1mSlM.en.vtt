so again just a second ago gave me the
shift<00:00:12.330> study<00:00:12.630> because<00:00:12.929> she<00:00:13.080> knew<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.500> was

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
shift study because she knew that I was

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
shift study because she knew that I was
gonna<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> right<00:00:14.750> I<00:00:15.750> said<00:00:15.900> already

here to the far right side you've got
this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> muffler<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.119> grab<00:00:24.680> and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this is muffler that you can grab and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.509 
this is muffler that you can grab and
basher<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.330> way<00:00:27.449> yeah<00:00:28.439> yeah<00:00:28.590> yeah

basher go down this way yeah yeah yeah
then<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.570> course<00:00:30.710> car<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.369> leverage<00:00:32.669> space

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
then of course car the leverage space

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.360 
then of course car the leverage space
always<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.350> traversal<00:00:36.860> like<00:00:37.860> we've<00:00:38.219> have

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
always about traversal like we've have

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.799 
always about traversal like we've have
talked<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.000> injustice<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
talked about it like injustice a lot of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
talked about it like injustice a lot of
the<00:00:39.899> interactive<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.950> Batman

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the interactive we're kind of a Batman

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.310 
the interactive we're kind of a Batman
and<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> internet<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.230> are

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and this a lot of the internet there are

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.450 
and this a lot of the internet there are
some<00:00:43.500> damaging<00:00:43.829> ones<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
some damaging ones that you can of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340 
some damaging ones that you can of
course<00:00:44.489> block<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.140> are

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
course block but a lot of these are

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.139 
course block but a lot of these are
about<00:00:46.500> traversal<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.160> getting<00:00:47.399> around

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.069 

we're<00:00:51.149> doing<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> background<00:00:51.510> breakdown

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
we're doing a background breakdown

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
we're doing a background breakdown
background<00:00:52.739> breakdown<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
background breakdown we got to see the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
background breakdown we got to see the
stoplight<00:00:54.860> green<00:00:55.860> means<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:57.180> yeah<00:00:57.559> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
stoplight green means go really yeah and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.819 
stoplight green means go really yeah and
then<00:00:58.680> finally<00:00:58.980> over<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.829> engine

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
then finally over here we have a engine

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.030 
then finally over here we have a engine
of<00:01:01.980> some<00:01:05.210> guys<00:01:06.210> try<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.500> rabid<00:01:07.830> dog

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of some guys try to get some rabid dog

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.090 
of some guys try to get some rabid dog
is<00:01:08.280> trying<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> attack<00:01:08.850> him<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.119> well<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.979> a

is trying to attack him so well in a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
is trying to attack him so well in a
destroyed<00:01:11.400> City<00:01:11.549> you've<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> fight<00:01:12.420> for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
destroyed City you've got to fight for

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.859 
destroyed City you've got to fight for
everything<00:01:12.750> you've<00:01:12.990> gotten<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:14.869> and

then you noticed in the video we showed
you<00:01:31.270> graphic<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.359> can<00:01:32.420> twist<00:01:32.689> them<00:01:32.899> up<00:01:33.020> and

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
you graphic you can twist them up and

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.240 
you graphic you can twist them up and
there's<00:01:33.380> some<00:01:33.500> more<00:01:33.619> stuff<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:33.829> happens

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
there's some more stuff that happens

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.730 
there's some more stuff that happens
afterwards<00:01:34.909> it's<00:01:35.530> awesome

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
afterwards it's awesome

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.499 
afterwards it's awesome
we're<00:01:37.490> actually<00:01:37.729> going<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.119> show<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.390> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
we're actually going to show you a

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.620 
we're actually going to show you a
different<00:01:39.200> thing<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.880> well<00:01:41.329> yeah<00:01:42.109> there's<00:01:42.560> so

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
different thing we well yeah there's so

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.999 
different thing we well yeah there's so
parasitology<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:45.140> looks<00:01:45.319> like<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.679> it<00:01:45.859> looks

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
parasitology it looks like it it looks

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.679 
parasitology it looks like it it looks
like<00:01:46.159> they<00:01:46.250> will<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.670> don't<00:01:47.119> believe<00:01:47.359> it<00:01:47.539> so

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
like they will I don't believe it so

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.120 
like they will I don't believe it so
we're<00:01:47.780> gonna<00:01:47.899> show<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.079> one<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.289> those<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:48.979> but

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
we're gonna show you one of those so but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.620 
we're gonna show you one of those so but
I<00:01:49.159> think<00:01:49.189> maybe<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:49.640> time<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.119> want<00:01:50.509> to

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
I think maybe it's time that we want to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.270 
I think maybe it's time that we want to
I<00:01:51.229> want<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:51.890> finish<00:01:52.130> being<00:01:52.429> home<00:01:52.640> okay<00:01:54.280> don't

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
I want to finish being home okay don't

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.059 
I want to finish being home okay don't
just<00:01:55.459> think<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:58.929> should<00:01:59.929> go<00:02:00.530> nice<00:02:02.860> all<00:02:03.860> right

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
just think I should go nice all right

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.360 
just think I should go nice all right
next<00:02:06.009> for<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.039> Sheldon<00:02:07.520> let's<00:02:07.909> do<00:02:08.149> it
