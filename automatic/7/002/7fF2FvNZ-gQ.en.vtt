at least 15 years if not longer so
here's<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.810> temporary<00:01:22.320> solution<00:01:22.920> eventually

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
here's the temporary solution eventually

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
here's the temporary solution eventually
I<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.210> stained<00:01:24.450> glass<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> put<00:01:25.110> that

I want to get stained glass to put that
window<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> meantime<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
window but in the meantime this is a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.090 
window but in the meantime this is a
window<00:01:27.509> film<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> comes<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> tube<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
window film that comes in a tube that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.240 
window film that comes in a tube that
