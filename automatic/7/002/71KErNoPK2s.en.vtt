00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello youtube friends here I bring you 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.129
 this new tutorial where I will show how 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 connect the motors step by step with 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.250
 arduino card 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.410
 We can recycle these engines from 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.800
 printers in poor condition that we have in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.800
 home 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.419
 stepper motors are ideal for 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.559
 school projects or robotics due 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.559
 to its turning precision 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.400
 this is the way we should 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.240
 connect the circuit for that we require 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.760
 of an integrated the 29 3 of two 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.270
 pushbuttons and two resistors of 10 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 kilograms 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.150
 is integrated indispensable since 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.620
 with this we avoid overloading the arduino 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.980
 since these integrated support a 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.880
 current of up to 600,000 amps and a 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.640
 voltage that can vary from 4.5 to 36 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
 volts of s 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.770
 here they have a clearer picture of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 integrated which does not work as a 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 H bridge 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 for the purposes 2 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 7 10 and 15 where we connect the output 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.549
 of the arduino 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 by pins 3 6 11 and 14 where 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:45.120
 we connect our stepper motor 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 by pins 19 and 16 we connect the 5 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.530
 volts that the arduino gives us 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.680
 and for the pinocho and earth we connect 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.600
 our external 12 volt source I'm going 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.060
 to show them different codes with the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.000
 which we can control the engine step to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.340
 step in this case for example we have a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 automatic system forward and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.619
 backwards in which we can vary the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.750
 speed and the number of turns or 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.050
 fraction of turns that we want the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.050
 engine 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.020
 with this variable we determine the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.380
 speed 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.100
 and with this other we determine the amount 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.330
 of turns with 50 pulses gives us a turn 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.590
 complete with 25 pulses gives us half turn 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.590
 and so on 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.900
 I'm going to show you 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.890
 as you can see the engine is giving 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.660
 a 360 degree turn in both directions 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.660
 automatically 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.020
 in this other case we can activate the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.190
 engine so that we go both ways 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:18.550
 but activating the pulsed the amount 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.720
 of turns achieved depends on how 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.720
 we have determined 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.340
 I'm going to show you 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.310
 As you can see, the motor turns to the side or 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.700
 towards the other every time we activate the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.700
 push buttons 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.560
 in the latter case we can also 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.650
 spin the engine in both directions 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.330
 but this will last on for the time 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.330
 that we have activated the buttons 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.930
 I'm going to show 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.030
 can not see an engine turns on both 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.920
 senses 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.920
 every time we activate on Saturday 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.600
 in the comments of today's video to 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.150
 give the link to download the 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.150
 codes and they can try them at home 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.780
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.009
 that will be very useful and we 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.009
 we see in a next video
