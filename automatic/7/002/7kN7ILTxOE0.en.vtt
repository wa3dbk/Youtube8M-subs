00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello everyone and welcome to Paris 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 turf tv for your daily show 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.769
 devoted to the quinté plus and 5.5 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 today to accompany me I receive 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 mathieu mortagne hello mathieu hello 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 lucie hello to all so we go 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.840
 to take an interest today in the grand prize 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.449
 dina vein to agen so a rope track to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.210
 right where they are eighteen starters to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 start with two starting ladders 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.699
 so mathieu I think you did 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.199
 second level trust 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.430
 yes I trusted the second 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.110
 echelon it may sound a little weird 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.489
 on a track like agen who's who 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.579
 remains a tourniquet and who has a little 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 known for a track that benefits the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.450
 competitors who start at the top but 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 good candidates there are certain 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 nominations that are unavoidable and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 who are at the second pole 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 so I did it but it's a track 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.140
 selective anyway so my the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 class horses expresses yes yes here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 so I think that still they can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.719
 coming back from the 25m very well listened to me on 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.879
 will let you give your prognosis 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.829
 so in the lead I spent 15 hours 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 jal rice then the cese mermaid 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.450
 fires on the 8 a water of montauroux the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
 sports leisure Leucate teases the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 9 gene ulcer or the 17 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 ramsès des charmes and August 18 medoc 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 so you said you rank in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 head the 15th remake challery that is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.330
 other than the winner of the 1400 gnt 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 meters the winner of the gnt 2014 she has 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 builds its success on precisely on 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.090
 these rope wins right because 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 it's still the real juice of the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 true right yesterday rope left she has 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.140
 still a little more balls even if 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.340
 she pretty much gets to do it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 is still a little less efficient 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.880
 here is the mare made a comeback 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.070
 she was clearly prepared for this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.230
 race she had won the stage of gnt 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 d'agen precisely last year 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.190
 it's six tests on the right leg 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
 after she is able to bypass her 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.660
 opponents and make the difference at 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 train on his class what so I think 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.170
 that if it makes its value even if it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.120
 may not be 100% it's 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.710
 for me the first song there she 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.940
 find damien good way france 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.590
 good damien who knows her by heart 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.480
 it was his regular driver last year 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.770
 so before the shot all fires are at 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.780
 green as they say but it's true that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 the agen stage she had given 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 scares a little to these projects this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 little girl made a small mistake 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.380
 but as so much class has 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.729
 caught up later because had it the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 margin to earnings precisely this time 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.900
 there but now the after a little bit of 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.340
 gains but the lot the lot is still 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.260
 in his strings 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.300
 be careful right behind you 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 classify the number 16 siren de feugères 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.690
 who she just was unhappy 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 unfortunate enough it's a little bit of saying 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.410
 she's really stopped net entry 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.269
 straight line to when the other day in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.580
 the quinté it was a Friday 13 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.170
 it was good it stays elsewhere and we have 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.819
 used fate he had told us that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.989
 his mare was not too ready he's 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.480
 counted for more than would these themes 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.040
 and 6.7 in his prognosis is well must 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.110
 well confess contré in what lé 17 when 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.670
 we watch the video and it's the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.830
 only who really has what they say 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 packaged it really has a lot of gas and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.549
 unfortunately she is in the back of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.090
 south and south is a little bit of ceret 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.239
 fault 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.099
 his driver cornered a concerned base in 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.510
 this mansuetude mermaid of feugères 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.700
 can not do otherwise than he climbed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.530
 in the make the picture if I think that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.579
 if and did by the fault that makes the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.079
 straight line I think she would have 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.340
 took a more active part on the finish 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.599
 oh yes when we see that it's his pride 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.250
 girl and who wins she had everything to 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.829
 does the right also to come with that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.230
 so on this performance the same if 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.700
 she is 25 meters away so she comes from 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.650
 to show its shape is excellent 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.610
 right handed 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.870
 be careful she jawa well in the three 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.000
 first okay but now it's a little 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.889
 close-quarters for close combat 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.450
 certainly but in the end she did not run 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.410
 of jewelery because as did 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.790
 the fault between a right while she 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.269
 were plenty of resources to clean and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.739
 relocation 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.970
 so I think that's why you 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.739
 go the fate of the discount on the ranks 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.540
 here it is that here it comes to recover 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.010
 I think it's okay we're going 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.609
 listen to what thierry duvaldestin has 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.139
 Arnaud Lecomte said Cyril Duval 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.430
 destiny you will represent mermaid of 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.830
 fires a few days apart 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.990
 after his unfortunate exit to caen 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.370
 these people who is doing good right is 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.480
 true to approach a five- course 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.760
 days 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.159
 good here is the semer at least there before 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.800
 she can bear that good now he 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.020
 sponge kursaal 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.450
 a particular febrile and then a few 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.850
 choice at the top of the communal premises of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.880
 amount totally quite honest 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.410
 earned 1.3 and not the songs sold 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.210
 perceive the victory I think not grateful 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.070
 enough resources but weight in the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.330
 quinté and why not see especially 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.290
 those a hidden route that she can 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.940
 to be brought back it's really 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.880
 important that it provides for the description 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.970
 dependent on that and it goes well normand 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.870
 a good start and there to go 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.400
 - pd no fifth place I know 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.660
 known on a scale of 5 is 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.460
 never confident the other day he the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.720
 not see at all but also not 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.020
 the fault if she did not stop then 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.480
 been nearby so well he's doing the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.320
 moving I challenge my game I think 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.260
 on what we saw 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310
 I see it very well ok just behind 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.690
 you rank the 8th 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.640
 a water montaut therefore makes the rest 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.840
 on two victories on this plot they will you 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.100
 will show they would be it always 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.940
 been a very good horse that was spared 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.340
 by his entourage 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.110
 he remains on two victories in the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.640
 lower categories but hey he 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.140
 was beating horses like theo of jc 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.720
 there he goes 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.520
 it is full town the horse is here 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.390
 it's the logic it's the horse in 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.210
 form of the race 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.380
 he goes in the lead agen so we said in 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.790
 beginning of broadcast it was still 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.830
 a big advantage to go ahead 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.030
 this is he's gonna he's able to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.400
 fight with our two favorites I think 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.020
 very well just behind you rank the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.250
 two sportsmen made to him when 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.480
 same proof of regularity 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.860
 yeah that's my favorite 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.360
 there because he made a comeback more 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.740
 that it's a joke to nyanza finally really 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.620
 do the straight line but really we 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.390
 felt that mickaël cormy 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.500
 was not hotter than it's liked 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.780
 his horse really made a beautiful 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.670
 straight line he makes the move he 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.140
 share in the lead is a horse who loves 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.580
 well the little rings like that it does 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.500
 well marseille vivaux which certainly rope to 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.730
 left but he was second handsome but 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.070
 he was in front of justine of duvivier 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.300
 day there on a little ring like that he 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.680
 share in mind it's me I think it can 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.840
 to be the very funny rating on arrival 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.760
 okay we discover agen is good 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.680
 but then he discovers agen but hey 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.300
 tell you and he does well these kind 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.520
 track these horse-type laws of 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.380
 province so he has already formed body the 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.240
 right there is no worry on the rope 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.680
 he had in his youth at the time he 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.810
 had won at caen this horse there no 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.270
 how the beautiful bother and that's it 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.740
 No, I think it's pretty funny 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.540
 speculative rating is a little bit of 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.520
 poker me I think okay and finally in 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.350
 fifth you rank leucate teases 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.640
 of the leisure school is the best chance 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.800
 of Benjamin Gates 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.390
 yes this is the line of a water of 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.400
 montauroux so when he just failed 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.960
 little against him it's a very good 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.520
 mare running through a beautiful pass 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.870
 shape because it was thought very limited 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.400
 and then he ran these 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.410
 races in the province on routes 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280
 flat bah it was well had won his 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.260
 vincennes race with matthieu 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.000
 abrivard this winter in the extension 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.640
 of her winter she is still very much 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.930
 shape and leaves in front the arms so she 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.270
 is going to race normally there will be 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.260
 no problem so before you hit it 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.060
 a very good chance to be in the 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.230
 quinted to heaven okay low it looks like 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.710
 that there are still some bases 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.510
 solid 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.680
 it's a pretty open race but it 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.680
 are two or three things that I like 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.990
 it 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.820
 I think that normally we should not 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.050
 not be far from the truth here after 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.300
 maybe maybe there are maybe two 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.919
 three things to add in a field 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.169
 wide stepped expand a little bit 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.520
 but it's funny as I like 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.139
 but I like the three bases very 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.789
 well we will follow that with a big 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.650
 interest thank you very much mathieu of course 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.930

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.240
