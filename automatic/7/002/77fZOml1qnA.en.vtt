00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 we were not expecting 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.750
 start the championship well 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:14.019
 beyond that this is very long so 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.019
 yes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 but 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.850
 but good forward let's continue 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.980
 trying this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.620
 and look for the win because the only thing 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 it takes us out of this more than anything in power 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.220
 speak up and say so many things it's a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.510
 victory and unfortunately the last 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.940
 Saturday we could not get it 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.570
 even last year we went through a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.220
 bad streak too 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.490
 but we got out of that and in the end we'll be 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.240
 champions so how do I tell you 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.840
 surely but it is what can be 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.320
 all year 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.640
 we simply know that the results 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.200
 they influence the perspective of the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 party and good and unfortunately the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.050
 results have not been accompanying us 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.270
 today 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.059
 so good that has given to be 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.290
 a lot of things but I'm sure that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.229
 as a triumph 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.360
 yes, yes, we are not 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.100
 we are in as for the bad start that 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.510
 we've had in the year I do not think anyone 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.050
 I expected it but beyond that 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.870
 sports 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.760
 everything I can see I think that 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.370
 that we talked to each other if 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.070
 we left there because well we have a 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.350
 a 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.450
 a goal 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.930
 in the short term that is to take out the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.990
 first time like this is not new in 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.060
 this world in football this is normal 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.470
 when a technician does many many 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 matches that the press over enough 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.950
 names or they wanted the technician got off 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.899
 very calm there and has felt because 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.180
 I have come to work today 32 as 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.979
 only with the teacher we are also very 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.380
 calm in the sense also we 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.159
 we work normally 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.159
 so 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.060
 what less what less now 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.370
 we are doing as players is is 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.009
 letting ourselves be carried away or listening to things that 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.540
 come from outside right now if you 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.310
 They have credit is a bit complicated 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 by the player not listening to some things 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 because good definitely that 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.360
 everywhere negative things come out in the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.510
 Do not speak with reason for the moment 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.990
 results but good for the moment 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 we have to leave everything to work 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.360
 calmly 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.770
 the same is the only way to get out 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 from this hole 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:47.130
 there is nothing else you need to work 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.130
 train and train let's say talk 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.110
 in any kind of 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.599
 of medication to fix simply 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.599
 the only way to work this week
