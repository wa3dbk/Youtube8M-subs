00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
and then the moments that I thought were

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.800 
and then the moments that I thought were
the<00:02:29.470> moments<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.580> knew<00:02:31.270> we<00:02:31.600> were<00:02:31.660> all

the moments that I knew we were all
turned<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.200> at<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.470> time<00:02:32.680> became<00:02:33.370> major

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
turned on at the time became major

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.330 
turned on at the time became major
elements<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.660> constructing<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.410> piece<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
elements in constructing this piece the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.449 
elements in constructing this piece the
garage<00:02:36.640> band<00:02:37.060> evolutionary<00:02:37.780> mentality

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459

garage band evolutionary mentality
that's<00:02:39.459> another<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.060> saying<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.630> have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
that's another way of saying you have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.860 
that's another way of saying you have
people<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.410> GM<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.100> let<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.490> let<00:02:42.550> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
people that like GM and let and let the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.420 
people that like GM and let and let the
formality<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.020> composition<00:02:44.650> emerge<00:02:45.130> from

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
formality of the composition emerge from

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.729 
formality of the composition emerge from
that<00:02:45.640> process<00:02:45.910> as<00:02:46.330> opposed<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.750> being<00:02:47.050> just

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
that process as opposed to being just

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.460 
that process as opposed to being just
all<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.070> paper<00:02:48.250> right<00:02:48.550> away<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:50.200> why

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
all on paper right away so that's why

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.330 
all on paper right away so that's why
it's<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.709> easy<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.310> these<00:02:51.790> guys

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it's so easy for these guys

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.600 
it's so easy for these guys
the<00:02:53.430> piece<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.560> part<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.160> them<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.459> in
