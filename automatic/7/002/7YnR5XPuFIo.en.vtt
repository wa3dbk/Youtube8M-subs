00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.410
 how to make your dining room a 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.289
 family coexistence space where 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.630
 everyone can talk comfortably easy 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.230
 Follow these 5 key points to decorate 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.230
 your dining room 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.339
 the first point chooses the right color 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.769
 remember that colors affect the 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.360
 mood of people can 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.150
 play with the tones and thus create a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.130
 comfortable space if you want a touch 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.100
 of personality in your dining room uses 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.140
 strong tones and use more than three colors 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 do not limit yourself to neutral tones test 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.130
 with other tones and you'll see how it changes 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.690
 totally space if what 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.070
 you prefer is a relaxing environment 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.070
 uses pale tones 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.780
 if the space with which you account is 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.150
 the ideal is that the table is long 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
 thus no spaces will be left on the sides 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.800
 nor at the end of your dining room if the space 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.620
 is small try to use a table 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.140
 small whether round or square if you 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.850
 you decide for the round table remember that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.330
 will help you soften the corners of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 space 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.090
 third balance point your dining room 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.400
 add some furniture of different height or 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.260
 you could play with a centerpiece 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 in mind not to use a very high one anymore 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.180
 that will prevent the view at the time of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.180
 live together 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 fourth point takes into account the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.140
 illumination 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.270
 The most important thing is to illuminate the table 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.340
 main goal is to make it look 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.230
 beautiful and allow the center of the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 table and other accessories look the best 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.180
 possible I recommend a warm light or 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.280
 neutral for greater relaxation a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.040
 Candlestick candles or hanging lamps 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 they are a good option try to balance 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.170
 the light of your dining room with the size of the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.170
 table 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 a piece of furniture that helps you keep the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.830
 order an excellent option to have in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.350
 order your dining room is to add the furniture 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 will make it easier to keep and keep close to 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.530
 tablecloths covered or accessories for your 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530
