00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.460 
reason and that's probably the best
thing<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.740> second<00:01:26.189> effect<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.470> don't

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
thing about it the second effect I don't

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
thing about it the second effect I don't
know<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> mean<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
know I mean it's kind of it's not like I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
know I mean it's kind of it's not like I
happen<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> trishula<00:01:32.820> version<00:01:33.150> Joshua

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
happen with the trishula version Joshua

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.030 
happen with the trishula version Joshua
version<00:01:33.990> basically<00:01:34.500> still<00:01:34.740> had<00:01:34.890> your

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
version basically still had your

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
version basically still had your
shoeless<00:01:35.340> effect<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
shoeless effect you know with all that

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.170 
shoeless effect you know with all that
but<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.950> course<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.579> didn't<00:01:38.850> give<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but of course they didn't give it the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
but of course they didn't give it the
same<00:01:39.360> effect<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> sinker<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.770> can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
same effect of the sinker which I can

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.560 
same effect of the sinker which I can
understand<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.880> mean<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.270> sense

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
understand I mean that makes sense

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
understand I mean that makes sense
because<00:01:42.930> Ron<00:01:43.350> expect<00:01:43.770> he's<00:01:44.009> probably<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
because Ron expect he's probably one the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
because Ron expect he's probably one the
strongest<00:01:44.850> synchros<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
strongest synchros out there if not the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.899 
strongest synchros out there if not the
strongest<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> lot<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> ways<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.759> has<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
strongest in a lot of ways and it has a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
strongest in a lot of ways and it has a
really<00:01:48.119> scary<00:01:48.360> effect<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.960> i<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.290> understand

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
really scary effect so i can understand

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.719 
really scary effect so i can understand
you're<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.009> wanting<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> make<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you're not really wanting to make that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
you're not really wanting to make that
card<00:01:50.939> happen<00:01:51.240> again<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.570> ritual<00:01:52.049> form<00:01:52.320> but

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
anyway it's no that just makes it we're

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.350 
anyway it's no that just makes it we're
up<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:55.890> special<00:01:56.790> 7<00:01:57.000> monster<00:01:57.119> from<00:01:57.299> the

internet get shuffled back into the deck
and<00:01:59.250> i<00:01:59.460> don't<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.700> why<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.180> work<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> like

extra day so not sure why they worried
it<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.289> kind<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> thought

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it like that but I just kind of thought

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.950 
it like that but I just kind of thought
that<00:02:10.649> was

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
that was

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.890 
that was
funny<00:02:11.320> on<00:02:11.560> there<00:02:12.100> but<00:02:12.370> yeah<00:02:12.850> still<00:02:13.180> not<00:02:13.360> bad<00:02:13.630> of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
funny on there but yeah still not bad of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.240 
funny on there but yeah still not bad of
an<00:02:14.050> effect<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.410> mean<00:02:14.560> all<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:14.770> stuff<00:02:14.980> coming

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
an effect I mean all this stuff coming

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.710 
an effect I mean all this stuff coming
out<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.460> from<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> extra<00:02:16.180> day<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.450> mean<00:02:16.600> that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
out with from the extra day I mean that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.810 
out with from the extra day I mean that
can<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.170> annoying<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.280> would<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.580> really

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
can be annoying but I would have really

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.970 
can be annoying but I would have really
in<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.390> way<00:02:19.420> have<00:02:19.960> really<00:02:20.200> liked<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.470> seen<00:02:20.770> a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
in a way have really liked to seen a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.800 
in a way have really liked to seen a
veronic<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.550> old<00:02:21.820> affect<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> synchro<00:02:22.540> effect

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
veronic so old affect the synchro effect

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with that but again I can understand why

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.490 
with that but again I can understand why
because<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.570> effect<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.260> powerful

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.640 
a through-line wryneck ones are both
warriors<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.630> could<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.230> possibly<00:03:20.410> mean

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
warriors so could this possibly mean

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770 
warriors so could this possibly mean
some<00:03:21.100> others<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:21.760> could<00:03:22.240> see<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:22.630> i<00:03:22.750> was

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
some others we could see like i was

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.270 
some others we could see like i was
actually<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> look<00:03:23.800> at<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.040> theory

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
actually have a look at of the theory

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.500 
actually have a look at of the theory
that<00:03:24.370> maybe<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.910> was<00:03:25.000> all<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.210> ones<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.480> were

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
that maybe it was all the ones that were

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.300 
that maybe it was all the ones that were
corrupted<00:03:26.080> so<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:26.590> could<00:03:26.770> see<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.190> know<00:03:27.280> like

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
corrupted so we could see you know like

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.460 
corrupted so we could see you know like
a<00:03:27.490> drag<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.600> know<00:03:28.720> become<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.020> knee<00:03:29.200> cloth

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
a drag you know become a knee cloth

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.980 
a drag you know become a knee cloth
maybe<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.250> gym<00:03:30.850> night<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.360> card<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.900> a

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
maybe like a gym night like card and a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.570 
maybe like a gym night like card and a
lot<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> different<00:03:32.590> ones<00:03:32.710> out<00:03:32.890> there<00:03:32.920> catastor

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
lot of different ones out there catastor

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.790 
lot of different ones out there catastor
even<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.960> spellcaster<00:03:35.200> Type<00:03:35.620> though

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
being close spellcasters I was thinking

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.740 
being close spellcasters I was thinking

actually like aerial or something

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.040 
actually like aerial or something
possibly<00:03:42.340> being<00:03:42.820> reborn<00:03:43.270> in<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.600> sneak<00:03:43.870> off

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
possibly being reborn in the sneak off

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.840 
possibly being reborn in the sneak off
our<00:03:44.230> tap<00:03:44.440> not<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:45.160> sure<00:03:45.310> just<00:03:45.340> kind<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.760> a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
our tap not really sure just kind of a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.120 
our tap not really sure just kind of a
theory<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.330> but<00:03:46.960> it<00:03:47.050> does<00:03:47.230> show<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.500> of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
theory on that but it does show that of

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.170 
theory on that but it does show that of
course<00:03:48.280> we're<00:03:48.460> going<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:48.640> see<00:03:48.730> more<00:03:48.850> light<00:03:49.030> and

course from the deck to the graveyard I

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.090 
course from the deck to the graveyard I
think<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.200> will<00:04:02.440> make<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.680> little<00:04:02.890> bit<00:04:02.980> more

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
think this will make a little bit more

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.830 
think this will make a little bit more
sense<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.460> future<00:04:03.820> too<00:04:04.030> because<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
sense in the future too because like I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.940 
sense in the future too because like I
said<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.230> have<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.380> feeling<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.710> we're<00:04:05.860> going

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
said I have a feeling that we're going

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.770 
said I have a feeling that we're going
to<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> lot<00:04:06.430> more<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.940> this<00:04:06.970> art<00:04:07.270> type<00:04:07.510> and
