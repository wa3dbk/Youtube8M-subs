00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.600

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.700

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.880

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.710
 for the first time my favorites of the month and 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 this time we are going to make the favorites of the 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.830
 month 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.350
 where he had made these videos is how 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:24.070
 that rejected me so to speak, that is, was 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.630
 like the virals already being boring and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.110
 suddenly start watching many videos 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.110
 of favorites 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.140
 The first thing that I do not think is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.140
 this cream is left 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.460
 this cream is called 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.710
 natural soap removes the Review 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.090
 blogs so they will have the link below 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.160
 in the box to see the full review 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.449
 it's a manna cream that has an aroma 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.410
 delicious bone says with that I do not know 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.410
 can eat says 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.329
 good now not in when 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.110
 but the consumption or something like that is one that 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.790
 love very very rich can not be magical 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.800
 and I have it measured in the wallet and I used it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.100
 at work basically every day 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.869
 so many lives do not have another 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.869
 thing if we are the two brothers is 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.220
 this basis the program that I had them 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.900
 shown by facebook when you buy it 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.509
 and the truth is that it's enough because 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.909
 now I bought myself a mom but still 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.220
 do not use it and since man I come 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.250
 using stressed all the times that I 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.440
 when the nails is the forgiveness is the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.460
 nourished is pro-structuring with 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.460
 vitamin b5 and measures calculation to say 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 Well, let's see, I have these ampules of 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.209

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.969

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.549
 I did cleaning and I found them and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.079
 I started using good has been are 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.780
 practices for travel I remember that 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 When I traveled to Rosario, I took 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.069
 a couple and they were the most super thing 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.720
 practices another thing that I'm using a 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.360
 heap because he's hitting bottom is this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.210

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.160
 I can not believe I touched bottom 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.740
 so fast or is it striking my attention 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.690
 because it's okay if I just use it for 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.690
 daily all day but 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.980

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.830

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.740

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.780
 apothecary balm

 what bergamot orange lip balm 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.180
 before this came tico up here 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 and a lot when you go to Chinatown 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.660
 new when I eat dietetics where 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 I buy lime 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.390
 the shampoo will get another addition 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.690
 it's great 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.569
 You gave me ingredients 100% natural post 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.459
 he also treated us they studied animals not 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.459
 They have gluten-free opening 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.960
 I do not know what else he says he's very tiny 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.030
 but I'm going to take out the emmys this played very 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.280
 soon because it is very rich it does not come out 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.249
 above all the bags all the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.519
 that he had all use of this nothing else 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:40.509
 then and to finish it I have 

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:42.849
 bases that we have a lot but 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.819
 not the summer could not use because 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.849
 with the heat was where my face shone 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.409
 a lot and 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.379
 Now what good it down a little 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:57.690
 temperature begins to use and are key 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:05:00.210
 of glory in light tone 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.669
 at 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.039
 c3 I really have a long time left 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.030
 of dark but for the next month I 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.470
 I'm going to buy the one that is 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.700
 so she mixed them and used them 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.960
 we were because it 's super super light 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.970
 and let's say it right now I'm 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.720
 I have illuminating post but it leaves as 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.370
 as the way as well as use as I do not know how 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.830
 explain with a feeling of skin 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.660
 hydrated and it also shows why the 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.090
 skin is shiny but this is a 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.650
 base the water has no oil then the 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.270
 piece feel very light like that 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.790
 you just feel that you are not exposed to washing 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.530
 the skin feels very cute and after 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.240
 I'm also using as I told you 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.370
 that is like this is if it is a baby 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.530
 cream have very good coverage of 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.120
 legs is not the same coverage because 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.110
 the two must be given as two layers 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.020
 to have a good culture I would say is 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.600
 the coverage we are going to use 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.460
 with the truth 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.700
 are the liquid trusts is obviously 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.350
 It is more liquid than this and they are the bases 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.660
 that I'm using now because when that 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.460
 they are point more the cold the bean will change 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.420
 to another with a little more coverage 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.160
 but for now these 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.860
 I love them, I'm forgetting about that 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.660
 product that is my favorite forever 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.820
 I do not know if it's worth putting in this kind of 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.310
 videos because then always all the 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.520
 days provided it is the studio fix of 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.800
 mac in the color in that already looks in these 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.160
 30 I think it's already in their 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.790
 last because he's already dying and I'm going 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.040
 to try to use what little is left 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.460
 April because it 's older than I'm going to have 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.890
 a new one and I love a giving birth are 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.130
 every day also following is 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.410
 cheap is not expensive either, it will not be for 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.140
 that lasted me as hard as a year and three 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.180
 months until today one year three months and I 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.480
 is all the gold quoted that is asked 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.480
 still 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:01.279
 and quite well done when I bought it 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.279
 because I think 500 peak 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.879
 it's not that expensive 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.530
 and not the days getting good now that 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.240
 I'm using more these bases for and this one 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.240
 he does not like it that much anymore 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.450
 but at least for all it was summer yes 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.810
 until it opens in March it started to be 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.550
 I was using it cold and I love it and 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.950
 good nothing up here the video today 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.460
 never made such a short video is weird or 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.790
 I feel weird filming like this in 5 or 6 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.790
 minutes 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.930
 but I hope you liked it 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:41.240
