very much anymore serial printers things

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.029 
very much anymore serial printers things
like<00:00:37.239> that<00:00:37.449> and<00:00:37.690> it's<00:00:38.140> pretty<00:00:38.469> rare<00:00:38.739> actually

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
like that and it's pretty rare actually

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.819 
like that and it's pretty rare actually
to<00:00:39.339> find<00:00:39.519> them<00:00:39.729> with<00:00:39.879> all<00:00:40.179> 25<00:00:40.899> pins<00:00:41.289> in<00:00:41.469> it<00:00:41.559> and

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
to find them with all 25 pins in it and

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.979 
to find them with all 25 pins in it and
as<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.609> can<00:00:42.699> see<00:00:42.760> here<00:00:43.089> they're<00:00:43.239> all<00:00:43.479> in<00:00:43.749> there

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
as you can see here they're all in there

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.439 
as you can see here they're all in there
and<00:00:44.229> a<00:00:45.159> lot<00:00:45.399> of<00:00:45.489> times<00:00:45.639> you'll<00:00:45.819> find<00:00:45.850> only<00:00:46.179> two

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
and a lot of times you'll find only two

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.689 
and a lot of times you'll find only two
or<00:00:46.569> three<00:00:46.780> in<00:00:46.960> there<00:00:47.199> makes<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.889> a<00:00:47.949> lot<00:00:48.069> harder

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
or three in there makes it a lot harder

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.869 
or three in there makes it a lot harder
to<00:00:48.909> go<00:00:49.059> after<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.539> stuff<00:00:50.469> but<00:00:51.069> these<00:00:51.670> are<00:00:51.789> all

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
to go after the stuff but these are all

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.819 
to go after the stuff but these are all
brand<00:00:52.210> new<00:00:52.449> so<00:00:52.659> they<00:00:52.719> have<00:00:52.870> no<00:00:53.109> solder<00:00:53.440> on<00:00:53.679> them

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
brand new so they have no solder on them

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.860 
brand new so they have no solder on them
which<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.579> course<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.909> refiners<00:00:55.389> like<00:00:55.569> that<00:00:55.839> a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
which of course the refiners like that a

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.259 
which of course the refiners like that a
lot<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:57.729> know<00:00:57.819> there's<00:00:57.969> gonna<00:00:58.059> be<00:00:58.149> a

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
lot and you know there's gonna be a

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.059 
lot and you know there's gonna be a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
thing which is a big key for your

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.869 
thing which is a big key for your
refiner<00:01:02.649> when<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.039> get<00:01:03.159> ready<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.429> go<00:01:03.549> send

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.590 
but it does take a lot more time why
don't<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.429> start<00:01:42.820> sorting<00:01:43.179> it<00:01:43.270> out<00:01:43.359> a<00:01:43.420> little

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
don't you start sorting it out a little

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.959 
don't you start sorting it out a little
bit<00:01:43.810> yourself<00:01:43.929> and<00:01:44.499> it'll<00:01:44.979> be<00:01:45.159> faster<00:01:45.670> for<00:01:45.850> us

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
bit yourself and it'll be faster for us

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.599 
bit yourself and it'll be faster for us
both<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:46.539> you<00:01:47.079> know<00:01:47.170> we<00:01:47.439> can<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.679> get<00:01:48.310> into

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
both and you know we can get get into

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.700 
both and you know we can get get into
the<00:01:48.700> money<00:01:48.909> better<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.840> quicker<00:01:50.079> and<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.499> so<00:01:50.679> I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
the money better and quicker and I so I

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.580 
the money better and quicker and I so I
always<00:01:51.039> like<00:01:51.189> that<00:01:51.429> getting<00:01:51.759> into<00:01:51.909> money

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
always like that getting into money

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.719 
always like that getting into money
faster<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:54.039> know<00:01:54.130> more<00:01:54.340> money<00:01:54.549> if

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
faster and you know more money if

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.190 
faster and you know more money if
possible<00:01:55.210> because<00:01:55.329> he<00:01:55.539> has<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.780> do<00:01:55.899> less<00:01:56.109> work

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
possible because he has to do less work

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.910 
possible because he has to do less work
then<00:01:56.950> maybe<00:01:57.249> he'll<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:58.509> bonus<00:01:58.899> me<00:01:59.079> on<00:01:59.319> on

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
then maybe he'll you know bonus me on on

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.349 
then maybe he'll you know bonus me on on
the<00:02:00.009> refining<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.609> anyway<00:02:00.850> let's<00:02:01.030> get<00:02:01.149> back<00:02:01.240> to

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
the refining so anyway let's get back to

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.080 
the refining so anyway let's get back to
the<00:02:01.479> db25<00:02:01.840> pins<00:02:02.609> I'm<00:02:03.609> gonna<00:02:03.759> show<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.939> how

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the db25 pins I'm gonna show you how

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.489 
the db25 pins I'm gonna show you how
simple<00:02:04.149> this<00:02:04.539> isn't<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.929> little<00:02:05.140> trick<00:02:05.319> I've

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
simple this isn't a little trick I've

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.319 
simple this isn't a little trick I've
just<00:02:05.679> figured<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.069> so<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> got<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> pair<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.090> vise

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
just figured out so I got a pair of vise

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.419 
just figured out so I got a pair of vise
grips

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
grips

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.509 
grips
what<00:02:09.000> I'm<00:02:09.119> finding<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.049> if<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.259> turn<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.829> to

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
what I'm finding is if I turn this to

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.539 
what I'm finding is if I turn this to
where<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> small<00:02:12.209> end<00:02:12.750> comes<00:02:13.469> towards<00:02:14.040> me<00:02:14.129> now

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
where the small end comes towards me now

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.160 
where the small end comes towards me now
that's<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:14.969> really<00:02:15.359> important<00:02:15.810> I've

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that's that's really important I've

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.479 
that's that's really important I've
tried<00:02:16.469> it<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.739> all<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:17.040> other<00:02:17.159> different

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
tried it in all the other different

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.039 
tried it in all the other different
orientations<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.420> far<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.659> haven't<00:02:18.870> done

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
orientations and so far I haven't done

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.839 
orientations and so far I haven't done
all<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.349> well<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.859> but<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.549> one<00:02:20.730> has

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
all that well with it but this one has

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.119 
all that well with it but this one has
found<00:02:21.060> I've<00:02:21.510> found<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.900> very<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.469> and

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
found I've found it to be very good and

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.800 
found I've found it to be very good and
take<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.700> pins<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.510> out<00:02:24.780> there

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
take the little pins that are out there

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.629 
take the little pins that are out there
that<00:02:25.049> are<00:02:25.260> sticking<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.950> those<00:02:26.489> are

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
that are sticking out and those are

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.789 
that are sticking out and those are
going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.819> go<00:02:26.939> inside<00:02:27.389> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.629> vise<00:02:27.780> grip<00:02:28.079> and

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
going to go inside of the vise grip and

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.220 
going to go inside of the vise grip and
then<00:02:28.889> I<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.189> take<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.849> just<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.450> set

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
then I just take this and just just set

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.949 
then I just take this and just just set
it<00:02:31.319> up<00:02:31.379> there<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.799> clamp<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.269> just<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.689> tight

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
it up there and clamp it just just tight

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.599 
it up there and clamp it just just tight
and<00:02:34.849> just<00:02:35.849> we're<00:02:36.469> past<00:02:37.469> and<00:02:37.980> gotten<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.400> whole

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
and just we're past and gotten the whole

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.699 
and just we're past and gotten the whole
thing<00:02:38.909> right<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> edge<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
thing right up to the edge of that the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.559 
thing right up to the edge of that the
connector<00:02:41.159> there<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.359> this

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
connector there and then I take this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.879 
connector there and then I take this
pair<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> dikes<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.840> twist<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.680> time

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
pair of dikes and I just twist it a time

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.699 
pair of dikes and I just twist it a time
or<00:02:46.919> two<00:02:47.220> twist<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.569> forth<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.530> then

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
or two twist it back and forth and then

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.750 
or two twist it back and forth and then
I've<00:02:49.799> been<00:02:49.919> just<00:02:50.069> pulling<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.489> off<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
I've been just pulling it right off the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.520 
I've been just pulling it right off the
top<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.359> this<00:02:51.569> time<00:02:51.780> didn't<00:02:52.049> work<00:02:52.169> but<00:02:52.349> I've

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
top well this time didn't work but I've

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.729 
top well this time didn't work but I've
kind<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.129> tried<00:02:53.219> to<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.609> for<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.790> camera<00:02:54.150> so

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
kind of tried to do it for the camera so

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.789 
kind of tried to do it for the camera so
it's<00:02:55.739> been<00:02:55.980> working<00:02:56.189> very<00:02:56.489> well<00:02:57.379> there<00:02:58.379> we<00:02:58.469> go

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
it's been working very well there we go

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's been working very well there we go
sitting<00:02:59.189> just<00:02:59.370> pops<00:02:59.609> right<00:02:59.730> off<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.359> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
sitting just pops right off of there and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.030 
sitting just pops right off of there and
then<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.139> opens<00:03:01.469> right<00:03:01.650> up

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
then that opens right up

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.949 
then that opens right up
and<00:03:02.639> now<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:03.859> take<00:03:04.859> this<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.569> pop<00:03:06.569> out<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
and now I take this and pop out the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.759 
and now I take this and pop out the
little<00:03:07.169> black<00:03:07.349> piece<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.359> you<00:03:09.359> can<00:03:09.569> see<00:03:10.560> I'm

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
little black piece and you can see I'm

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:11.899 
little black piece and you can see I'm
trying<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.459> for<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.700> camera

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
trying to do it all that for the camera

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.250 
trying to do it all that for the camera
there<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.419> see<00:03:12.659> where<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.930> already

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
there you can see where it's already

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.780 
there you can see where it's already
started<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> come<00:03:13.829> apart<00:03:14.099> there's<00:03:14.340> two<00:03:14.459> pieces

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
started to come apart there's two pieces

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.759 
started to come apart there's two pieces
of<00:03:14.819> black<00:03:15.090> plastic<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:16.199> there<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.530> then<00:03:16.680> all

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
of black plastic in there and then all

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.159 
of black plastic in there and then all
the<00:03:16.889> gold<00:03:17.040> pins<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.030> when<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> pull<00:03:18.449> this<00:03:18.599> out<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
the gold pins so when I pull this out I

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.699 
the gold pins so when I pull this out I
can<00:03:19.560> put<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.120> metal<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:22.169> I<00:03:22.229> just<00:03:22.440> put<00:03:22.590> that

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
can put this is metal so I just put that

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.920 
can put this is metal so I just put that
over<00:03:22.829> my<00:03:22.979> metal<00:03:23.280> bin<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.639> then<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.419> plastic

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
over my metal bin and then this plastic

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.839 
over my metal bin and then this plastic
I<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.169> put<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:25.409> my<00:03:25.439> plastic<00:03:25.889> bin<00:03:26.069> but<00:03:26.699> watch

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
I can put in my plastic bin but watch

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.599 
I can put in my plastic bin but watch
what<00:03:27.060> happens<00:03:27.389> as<00:03:27.479> soon<00:03:27.659> as<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.870> pull<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.290> out

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
what happens as soon as I pull this out

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.789 
what happens as soon as I pull this out
all<00:03:29.609> those<00:03:29.909> pins<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:30.959> see<00:03:31.229> start<00:03:31.530> falling

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
all those pins you can see start falling

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.759 
all those pins you can see start falling
out<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.269> when<00:03:33.599> I<00:03:33.629> take<00:03:34.260> them<00:03:34.470> into<00:03:34.709> the

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
out and so when I take them into the

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.909 
out and so when I take them into the
bucket<00:03:35.099> over<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:36.229> there's<00:03:37.229> there's<00:03:37.560> nothing

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
bucket over here there's there's nothing

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.379 
bucket over here there's there's nothing
holding<00:03:38.159> them<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.729> I'll<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:38.970> put<00:03:39.150> them<00:03:39.209> into

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
holding them so I'll just put them into

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.839 
holding them so I'll just put them into
the<00:03:39.509> bucket<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.560> dump<00:03:41.099> them<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.639> they

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
the bucket and just dump them and they

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.689 
the bucket and just dump them and they
all<00:03:42.000> fall<00:03:42.269> right<00:03:42.540> out<00:03:42.979> so<00:03:43.979> see<00:03:44.280> there<00:03:44.459> wasn't

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
all fall right out so see there wasn't

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.309 
all fall right out so see there wasn't
any<00:03:44.790> kind<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.120> soldering<00:03:45.509> and<00:03:45.689> no<00:03:45.810> mess<00:03:46.079> no

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
