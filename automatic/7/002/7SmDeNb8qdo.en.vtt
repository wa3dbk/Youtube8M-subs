steam tanks to test it on the espresso
machine<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:07.110> sure<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.409> machine<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.920> off

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
machine make sure your machine is off

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.540 
machine make sure your machine is off
and<00:01:08.520> unplugged<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.870> can<00:01:10.110> test<00:01:10.409> between<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
and unplugged you can test between the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
blue connection and read your own meter

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
blue connection and read your own meter
and<00:01:17.040> there's<00:01:17.729> 19<00:01:18.120> ohms<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.900> eating

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and there's 19 ohms that's a good eating

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
and there's 19 ohms that's a good eating
element<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.580> takes<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:21.120> on<00:01:21.330> the

element same thing takes place on the
coffee<00:01:21.630> tank<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.740> test<00:01:23.040> between<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
coffee tank you can test between the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
coffee tank you can test between the
connection<00:01:24.510> from<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> red<00:01:24.990> wire<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:27.470> the

connection from the red wire and the
blue<00:01:28.649> wire<00:01:28.829> internally<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.420> 70<00:01:30.869> ohms

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
blue wire internally there are 70 ohms

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.420 
blue wire internally there are 70 ohms
that's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.649> good<00:01:31.829> eating<00:01:33.770> if<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.009> test<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that's a good eating if you test the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
that's a good eating if you test the
heating<00:01:35.700> element<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.920> no<00:01:38.189> reading

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
heating element and you get no reading

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.179 
heating element and you get no reading
that<00:01:39.149> means<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> coil<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> broken<00:01:40.500> internally

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that means the coil is broken internally

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.819 
that means the coil is broken internally
and<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:42.390> element<00:01:42.750> needs<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.170> replaced<00:01:43.469> if

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and the element needs to be replaced if

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
and the element needs to be replaced if
you<00:01:44.759> test<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.240> element<00:01:45.659> from<00:01:46.079> either<00:01:46.469> post<00:01:47.149> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you test an element from either post to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.209 
you test an element from either post to
ground<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.109> body<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> element<00:01:50.070> and

ground to the body of the element and

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.149 
ground to the body of the element and
you<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> reading<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.890> means

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you get any kind of reading that means

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.029 
you get any kind of reading that means
your<00:01:53.399> element<00:01:53.969> is<00:01:54.500> contaminated<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.679> water

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
your element is contaminated with water

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.130 
your element is contaminated with water
internally<00:01:56.820> there's<00:01:57.119> been<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.359> breach<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> the
