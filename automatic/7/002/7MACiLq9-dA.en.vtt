00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
model file but I suggest installing or

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.030 
model file but I suggest installing or
by<00:03:47.879> itself<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.689> lot<00:03:48.840> easier<00:03:49.259> and<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:50.009> can

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
by itself it's a lot easier and you can

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
by itself it's a lot easier and you can
avoid<00:03:50.459> other<00:03:51.000> conflicts<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.620> once<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.889> have

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
avoid other conflicts so once you have

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.289 
avoid other conflicts so once you have
that<00:03:53.220> copy<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:54.239> can<00:03:54.389> just<00:03:54.509> go<00:03:54.659> into<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.049> now

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
that copy you can just go into that now

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.819 
that copy you can just go into that now
you're<00:03:57.299> gonna<00:03:57.419> rename<00:03:57.810> both<00:03:58.109> these<00:03:58.290> files<00:03:58.560> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
you're gonna rename both these files the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.520 
you're gonna rename both these files the
exact<00:03:59.159> same<00:03:59.340> thing<00:03:59.609> your<00:03:59.759> name<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.900> SCM
