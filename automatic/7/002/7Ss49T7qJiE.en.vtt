00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
detail that day of bricks but I don't

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480 
detail that day of bricks but I don't
know<00:05:06.479> how<00:05:06.690> well<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.800> would<00:05:07.950> go<00:05:08.190> through

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
know how well it would go through

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.450 
know how well it would go through
tunnels<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.270> stuff<00:05:09.539> because<00:05:09.750> as<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:11.099> can<00:05:11.250> see

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
tunnels and stuff because as you can see

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.089 
tunnels and stuff because as you can see
the<00:05:11.610> load<00:05:11.849> itself<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.419> almost<00:05:13.380> taller

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
the load itself is almost taller

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.399 
the load itself is almost taller
actually<00:05:14.700> is<00:05:14.880> taller<00:05:15.210> than<00:05:15.390> Thomas<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.200> I

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
actually is taller than Thomas so I

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.029 
actually is taller than Thomas so I
don't<00:05:17.250> know<00:05:17.340> we'll<00:05:17.760> see<00:05:17.789> if<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:19.200> wrote<00:05:19.680> writes

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
don't know we'll see if it wrote writes

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.510 
don't know we'll see if it wrote writes
good<00:05:20.280> through<00:05:20.520> tunnels<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:21.780> next<00:05:22.110> car<00:05:22.349> is<00:05:22.979> the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
good through tunnels the next car is the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.390 
good through tunnels the next car is the
one<00:05:23.669> with<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.909> logs<00:05:24.180> which<00:05:24.659> I<00:05:24.780> told<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.050> about

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.439 
no cardboard in there so which is what
you<00:06:27.810> get<00:06:27.960> in<00:06:28.229> I<00:06:28.669> guess<00:06:29.669> yeah<00:06:29.969> you<00:06:30.180> can<00:06:30.300> face

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
you get in I guess yeah you can face

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.520 
you get in I guess yeah you can face
them<00:06:30.599> together<00:06:30.689> direction<00:06:31.259> you<00:06:31.319> can<00:06:31.439> have

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
them together direction you can have

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.860 
them together direction you can have
them<00:06:31.620> facing<00:06:31.919> like<00:06:32.039> that<00:06:33.050> or<00:06:34.050> this<00:06:35.870> I'm

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
them facing like that or this I'm

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.950 
them facing like that or this I'm
looking<00:06:37.110> forward<00:06:37.379> to<00:06:37.530> using<00:06:38.039> this<00:06:38.250> guy<00:06:38.460> and

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
looking forward to using this guy and

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.459 
looking forward to using this guy and
then<00:06:39.960> you<00:06:40.139> get<00:06:40.319> a<00:06:41.240> slate<00:06:42.240> car<00:06:42.599> that<00:06:42.930> is<00:06:43.050> paint

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
then you get a slate car that is paint

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.950 
then you get a slate car that is paint
that<00:06:43.949> is<00:06:44.069> not<00:06:44.310> painted<00:06:44.789> so<00:06:44.969> it<00:06:45.449> looks<00:06:45.719> more

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
that is not painted so it looks more

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.469 
that is not painted so it looks more
like<00:06:46.080> wagon<00:06:46.830> which<00:06:47.639> I<00:06:47.729> guess<00:06:47.879> is<00:06:48.030> appropriate

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
like wagon which I guess is appropriate

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.119 
like wagon which I guess is appropriate
for<00:06:48.629> this<00:06:48.719> hay<00:06:48.930> bale<00:06:49.139> load<00:06:49.409> there<00:06:50.099> is

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
when you actually set it in there

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.600 
when you actually set it in there
actually<00:06:55.500> right<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.710> little<00:06:55.979> bit<00:06:56.069> lower<00:06:56.250> which

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
actually right a little bit lower which

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.619
