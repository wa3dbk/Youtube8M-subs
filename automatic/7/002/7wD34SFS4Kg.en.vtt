00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.460
 the dose is going to be fed up, it's just 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460
 an adaptation 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.779

 books being about medicines 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 alternatives in the eight births 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.809
 essential oils for my children 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:03.799
 in no way our goal to go 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.880
 ask to propose a self-medication 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.979
 outrageous 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 it's for the little sores it's for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.090
 small accidents everyday the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 small colds the small burns the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.000
 little bites from the moment you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.990
 have bronchitis or ear infections 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.810
 important diarrhea know how to stay 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 within our framework within our limits and the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 mom of the rats anyway loud 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.740
 logically I go to the doctor this 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.300
 being said also there are some areas 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.369
 in which we excel because 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.650
 frankly if you have a child of 7 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 or 8 years who get warm a good 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.950
 reading 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.869
 tell me a little bit of doctors 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.550
 generalists what is he going to propose for 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.979
 a mononucleosis for your child 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.270
 go we will listen to keep the child at the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.369
 house it's going to happen 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.740
 three four five six weeks good he 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.540
 is already in the air by saying that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.070
 now if we look at the side of 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.550
 essential oils there we have a 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.640
 panel of antiviral activities that 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.750
 allow to come in quotation marks 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.459
 plug gaps or medicine 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 official has no power 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.060
 to intervene 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.739
 I'm just going to say of the five a 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.000
 essential and actually gave the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.080
 way of then I already remember one who 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.070
 is a must 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 it's called the crisis is the anti 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.910
 trauma but from the moment a 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 child falls bangs I mean 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.459
 whatever the location of the blue 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.720
 or hematoma and take it there 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.880
 has a wound or which are no peeled 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.290
 no matter just take two 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.350
 three drops of this essential oil 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.739
 is to apply it pure directly a 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.510
 hematoma to repeat the application five 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.079
 minutes after and then five more islands 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.940
 after and the hematoma will not even come out 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.310
 that I take a tell you that the beds 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.459
 Italian crisis is a superb sight 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.170
 the essential healing and that all 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.420
 all the essential oils are 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.980
 characterized by a common point namely 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.870
 that they are antiseptic 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.840
 it means that on a wound that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.390
 bleeds you have an action that prevents 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.769
 superinfection of the wound with the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.570
 italian crises besides it's going to get 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.790
 heal like the second one he 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.870
 essential that we must absolutely review 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.700
 the aspic lavender 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.860
 it's for any bites and the question 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.860
 is very interesting all about animals 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.720
 ravintsara tunes before sar but there we 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.909
 told you rob him of his rare and there 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.390
 it's really the antiviral me it's the 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:47.030
 little cold is the little city yesterday 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.430
 small greenhouse bronchitis small tic 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.760
 so there you have an essential oil 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.629
 is a superb anti-hail so with a 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.470
 spectrum of action excessively the court 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.840
 the interest of this essential oil 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.750
 it's next to this antiviral action 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.819
 there also an anti catarrhal action 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.599
 or if you want it will allow to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.120
 decongest all makes any sphere 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.730
 breathing any sphere orl which 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.370
 would be cluttered with a few 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.130
 neighborhood phlegm put censored to I 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.479
 speaks for children who are not 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.910
 babies who are over thirty months old 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.289
 I really like peppermint 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.449
 their peppermint 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.160
 this is the great louis the essential 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.250
 digestive 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.889
 which means that if you have a 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.860
 child who has gorged himself he is 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.680
 clearly to indigestion 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 well you can support his function 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.020
 digestive and all its liver function 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.479
 borough that the digestive tract accelerates to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.139
 end of his job processing 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.810
 any food there would have been to embarrassed 5th 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:58.710
 eucalyptus essential oils 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.720
 lemon eucalyptus lemony 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.840
 so this is not the case the most normal 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.530
 which of the site renÃ© him it is the anti 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.820
 inflammatory anti inflammatory that I 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.290
 I will be able to put on eczema 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.570
 I will be able to put on a sting of 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.900
 mosquito weighs on all the skins that 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.760
 are irritated rogie be bites of 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.560
 mosquito fire used pure for example 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.570
 and on an eczema I'm still going 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:31.530
 diluted by always keeping to a minimum 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.870
 the same amount of vegetable oil as 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.100
 it is an anti inflammatory but here it is 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.700
 that this essential oil is 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.680
 also usable in relation to 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.490
 all tendinitis so all 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.620
 tendinous inflammatory conditions 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.130
 joint muscles 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.030
 our only way to answer 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:58.710
 the activity of essential oils passes 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:06:03.930
 by the communication jacques have done 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.610
 books is information every 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.550
 floors of the little books of 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.560
 consumer awareness 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.780
 lambda that more in broadcast go the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.330
 see where it works on the baby 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.400
 I 'm going to apply myself network and without 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.460
 find resolved and then we will think about 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.880
 tendonitis and marie puiur thought was born 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.969
 like that if you do not want the fears of 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.729
 7 to 77 years old and a doctor 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:32.879
 on the mythical race old books on 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:35.599
 dermo-cosmetics of course and then we 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.839
 accompanies the consumer in 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.989
 the evolution of his knowledge 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:47.039
 and well here is the movement 

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:49.099
 this little kart to consume without 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.099
 moderation
