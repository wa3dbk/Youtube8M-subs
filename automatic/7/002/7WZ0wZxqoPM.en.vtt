00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
they will not search ok that is how you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.030 
they will not search ok that is how you
have<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.090> chain<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.740> negates<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
have to chain it because it negates the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.240 
have to chain it because it negates the
activation<00:03:47.070> does<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.060> negate<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.570> effect<00:03:50.480> um

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
activation does not negate the effect um

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.940 
activation does not negate the effect um
the<00:03:53.250> water<00:03:53.520> deck<00:03:53.820> has<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.630> lot<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.050> big<00:03:55.440> monsters

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
the water deck has a lot of big monsters

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.590 
the water deck has a lot of big monsters
so<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.160> think<00:03:56.220> bottomless<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.390> useful

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
so I think bottomless is really useful

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.350 
so I think bottomless is really useful
against<00:03:58.110> them<00:03:58.550> talking<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.700> some<00:03:59.850> people<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
against them talking to some people and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.720 
against them talking to some people and
I<00:04:00.570> have<00:04:00.870> one<00:04:01.410> bottomless<00:04:01.890> one<00:04:02.130> compulsory

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
I have one bottomless one compulsory

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.430 
I have one bottomless one compulsory
fiendish<00:04:03.000> chain<00:04:03.030> main<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:04.200> was<00:04:04.320> just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
fiendish chain main and that was just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.410 
fiendish chain main and that was just
like<00:04:04.650> um<00:04:04.950> what's<00:04:05.580> better<00:04:05.850> bottomless

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
like um what's better bottomless

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.699 
like um what's better bottomless
compulsive<00:04:07.020> feeding<00:04:07.260> chain<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.680> I

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
compulsive feeding chain I was like I

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.740 
compulsive feeding chain I was like I
know<00:04:08.100> it's<00:04:08.340> not<00:04:08.489> for<00:04:08.670> pulses<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.270> bottomless

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
know it's not for pulses like bottomless

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.690 
know it's not for pulses like bottomless
or<00:04:09.930> fiendish<00:04:10.260> team<00:04:10.380> better<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:11.190> bottomless

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
or fiendish team better like bottomless

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.360 
or fiendish team better like bottomless
so<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.510> were<00:04:12.660> siding<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.380> would<00:04:13.530> keep<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.100> would

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
so if I were siding I would keep I would

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.130 
so if I were siding I would keep I would
put<00:04:14.820> into<00:04:14.970> bottomless<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.720> one<00:04:15.840> component

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
put into bottomless and one component

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.080 
put into bottomless and one component
one<00:04:16.410> finishing<00:04:16.950> something<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.609> these

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
one finishing something like that these

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.699 
one finishing something like that these
bottomless<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.169> good<00:04:19.320> inside

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
bottomless is just really good inside

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.760 
bottomless is just really good inside
dang<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.040> gets<00:04:20.220> rid<00:04:20.520> of<00:04:20.609> all<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.940> beaters<00:04:21.209> like

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
dang it gets rid of all the beaters like

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.850 
dang it gets rid of all the beaters like
mega<00:04:22.770> lo<00:04:23.070> thinks<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.120> mean<00:04:24.630> basis<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.530> hits<00:04:25.710> for

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
mega lo thinks I mean basis so hits for

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.640 
mega lo thinks I mean basis so hits for
two<00:04:25.890> cards<00:04:26.280> but<00:04:26.430> at<00:04:26.550> least<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.790> bomb<00:04:27.030> lists<00:04:27.390> it

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
two cards but at least you bomb lists it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.380 
two cards but at least you bomb lists it
you<00:04:28.650> can<00:04:28.800> bottom<00:04:29.040> this<00:04:29.130> little<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.210> comes

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
you can bottom this little in that comes

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.940 
you can bottom this little in that comes
out<00:04:30.510> from<00:04:30.600> abyss<00:04:30.960> fear<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.680> that's<00:04:31.800> really

out from abyss fear so that's really

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.970 
out from abyss fear so that's really
useful<00:04:32.220> now<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.240> water<00:04:33.720> deck<00:04:33.990> has<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.320> pretty

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
useful now a water deck has a pretty

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.210 
useful now a water deck has a pretty
stable<00:04:35.550> side<00:04:36.300> deck<00:04:36.830> what<00:04:37.830> are<00:04:37.919> they<00:04:38.010> side

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
stable side deck what are they side

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.470 
stable side deck what are they side
against<00:04:38.460> well<00:04:38.640> they<00:04:38.760> don't<00:04:38.910> want<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> removing

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
against well they don't want to removing

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.270 
against well they don't want to removing
their<00:04:39.600> stuff<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.590> obviously<00:04:40.890> they're<00:04:41.130> going

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
to side Imperial iron wall then also

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.310 
to side Imperial iron wall then also
going<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.700> side<00:04:44.880> things<00:04:45.120> against<00:04:45.479> wind<00:04:45.900> ups<00:04:46.169> or

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
whatever other deck like goes and match

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.140 
whatever other deck like goes and match
they'll<00:04:49.169> make<00:04:49.410> water<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:50.010> water<00:04:50.370> all<00:04:50.729> day

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
they'll make water to water all day

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.440 
they'll make water to water all day
and<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.960> go<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.200> Matthew<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.250> good<00:04:53.910> counter

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
and just go to Matthew so good counter

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.990 
and just go to Matthew so good counter
side<00:04:54.690> would<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:55.590> something<00:04:55.920> like<00:04:56.040> fairy<00:04:56.700> wind

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
side would be something like fairy wind

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.750 
side would be something like fairy wind
fairy<00:04:57.510> wind<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.840> really<00:04:57.990> good<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:59.370> gets<00:04:59.520> rid<00:04:59.640> of

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
like in Pierre on wall goes and match

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.920
