Professional<00:00:32.420> the<00:00:33.420> same<00:00:33.840> exact<00:00:34.290> feature<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
Windows 7 home premium and I think it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
Windows 7 home premium and I think it's
one<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> greatest<00:00:42.149> things<00:00:42.540> they've<00:00:42.780> added

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
one of the greatest things they've added

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.590 
one of the greatest things they've added
I<00:00:43.290> don't<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:44.910> talked<00:00:45.329> about

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I don't know why it's not talked about

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.860 
I don't know why it's not talked about
more<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> why<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
more and why more people don't use it I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
more and why more people don't use it I
really<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:50.010> understand

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
really just don't understand

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.540 
really just don't understand
so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.289> people<00:00:52.590> should<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so I think people should use it all the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.110 
so I think people should use it all the
time<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.160> would<00:00:56.460> use<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.879> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
time and this is how you would use it in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.979 
time and this is how you would use it in
your<00:00:57.870> control<00:00:58.500> panel

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
your control panel

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 

well<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> guess<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> control

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
well I guess I can just go to control

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.750 
well I guess I can just go to control
panel<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:07.580> backup<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
panel you would just go to backup and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
panel you would just go to backup and
restore<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:11.210> over<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:12.960> setup

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
restore and over here you have setup

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.969 
restore and over here you have setup
back<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.490> yada-yada<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.320> over<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
back up in yada-yada but over here on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
back up in yada-yada but over here on
the<00:01:17.100> left<00:01:17.280> hand<00:01:17.520> side<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.900> says

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the left hand side there's one that says

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.120 
the left hand side there's one that says
create<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.009> system<00:01:20.759> image<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:22.009> when<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:25.130> press

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
create a system image and when you press

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
create a system image and when you press
this<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> an

options<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:48.090> choose<00:03:48.329> from<00:03:48.389> I<00:03:49.220> have<00:03:50.220> two<00:03:50.579> drives

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
options to choose from I have two drives

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.460 
options to choose from I have two drives
that<00:03:51.239> are<00:03:51.299> system<00:03:51.810> Drive<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.379> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that are system Drive so it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.759 
that are system Drive so it
automatically<00:03:53.189> includes<00:03:53.970> those<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.689> then<00:03:55.470> if

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
automatically includes those and then if

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.369 
automatically includes those and then if
I<00:03:55.889> wanted<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> back<00:03:56.879> up<00:03:57.150> any<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.079> my<00:03:58.169> other

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
I wanted to back up any of my other

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.959 
I wanted to back up any of my other
drives<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:59.129> could<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.549> that<00:04:01.159> but<00:04:02.159> I<00:04:02.219> don't<00:04:02.519> right

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
drives I could do that but I don't right

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.869 
drives I could do that but I don't right
now<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.799> you<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:04.829> push<00:04:05.250> next<00:04:05.759> and<00:04:07.549> then<00:04:08.549> it

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
now so you just push next and then it

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.330 
now so you just push next and then it
will<00:04:09.139> probably<00:04:10.139> give<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.650> some<00:04:10.680> type<00:04:11.310> of
