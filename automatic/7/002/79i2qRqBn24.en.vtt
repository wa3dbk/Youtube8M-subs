00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.690
 Beijing trembled 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.269
 the parquet literally split into two 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.820
 parts from powerful power of Odessa 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.430
 brother and sister Yuri Alena to Donets 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.400
 20 years sought to win this high 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.930
 title multiple champions of Ukraine 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.210
 Winner of the Cup winners of the Cup of Ukraine 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.330
 cis world cup finalists 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.240
 Reviews from the southern capital bypassed 48 pairs in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.059
 1 8 finals and were better than Russian 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.610
 and chinese and japanese dancers the most 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.910
 difficult and difficult was preparing for 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.379
 competition why because 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 psychological moment like you in any 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.200
 the sport he plays the main role 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.230
 then when a person sets a goal for himself 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.239
 make let's say there win over 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 Ukraine or Chun from Europe or 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:00.280
 World Cup is very difficult to build 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.440
 build a work schedule how to go to 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.869
 that is, the trainers should over this 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.630
 dancers work themselves athletes must 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.599
 so to be ready we went to this 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.670
 very long very long it 

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:14.890
 really the truth and the euro from the very 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.990
 start said 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.220
 why because not everywhere and not always 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.460
 Ukraine welcomes and in terms I have 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 in view of which plan all the same 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.369
 the country organizes the tournament then the country and 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.090
 to strive for their couple to be 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.759
 representatives as they say this ruins 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.190
 the most important rivals are the Italians and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.050
 the English say amphoras dance and powerful 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.880
 energy they have laid in the genes 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.159
 so going to the floor you need 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.710

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.890
