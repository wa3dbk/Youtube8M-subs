00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
your Achilles haven't seen a post on

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
your Achilles haven't seen a post on
online<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.590> now<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.280> idea<00:00:14.550> of<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
online about this now the idea of a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.339 
online about this now the idea of a
voodoo<00:00:14.880> band<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.509> wrap<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.900> tightly

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
voodoo band is you wrap it tightly

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.560 
voodoo band is you wrap it tightly
around<00:00:17.040> you<00:00:17.430> around<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.820> let<00:00:17.970> me<00:00:18.119> move<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
around you around you let me move it

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
around you around you let me move it
around<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.680> restores<00:00:19.919> stuff<00:00:20.399> gliding

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
around and it restores stuff gliding

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.870 
around and it restores stuff gliding
maybe<00:00:21.300> gets<00:00:21.660> rid<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.189> swelling<00:00:23.189> no<00:00:23.730> one's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
maybe gets rid of swelling no one's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
maybe gets rid of swelling no one's
quite<00:00:24.060> sure<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.750> we're<00:00:25.050> kind<00:00:25.259> of<00:00:25.320> speculate<00:00:25.680> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
quite sure so we're kind of speculate on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
quite sure so we're kind of speculate on
the<00:00:25.860> science<00:00:26.250> probably<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.119> multiple

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the science probably some multiple

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.389 
the science probably some multiple
tetanus<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> hundred<00:00:28.410> years<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.649> so<00:00:29.009> white

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
tetanus and a hundred years or so white

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.600 
tetanus and a hundred years or so white
