then begin to remove the paper wrapping

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.740 
then begin to remove the paper wrapping
I<00:00:18.990> used<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.619> knife<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.160> gently<00:00:20.910> remove<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
I used a knife and gently remove the
wrapping<00:00:21.960> I've<00:00:22.350> used<00:00:22.680> very<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.310> pressure

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
wrapping I've used very little pressure

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820

but<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.840> use<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> knife<00:00:25.439> instead<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
but if you do use a knife instead of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.890 
but if you do use a knife instead of
just<00:00:26.070> peeling<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:26.820> hand<00:00:27.180> make<00:00:27.570> sure<00:00:27.750> you
