00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello we are all here to demonstrate 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.760
 how do we make artificial artisan 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.869
 the first singles we should use 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.369
 They are the claw a skewer stick a 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:21.250
 cork a knife and a good hook 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.189
 first we run everything and we leave the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.920
 good knife cork the first step 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.050
 is with the knife to cut the cork 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.379
 to go giving it the shape we want 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.080
 for the cork once it's finished 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.750
 the shape of the heart we will move to 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.049
 second step that is with the stick of 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.090
 brochette we drill the cork so more 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:47.330
 late I passed the hook 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.480
 the third step is to grab the clamp 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.820
 I think the eye the piece we use it for 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.820
 when we put the hook inside the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.830
 cork have more grip then let's 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.250
 introduce the hook in the cone 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.070
 doing this we would have something like that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.760
 the fourth step is to grab many threads 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.930
 of different colors so we tie it with 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.360
 A new simple milestone to the hook 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.290
 or also to make sure a little more 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 it can be a double knot like that 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.860
 Like two legs, you can also 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.960
 insert glue so that the cork does not 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.560
 turn and also so that they do not move 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.070
 patitas fifth and last step is to paint it 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.680
 As we like it, I recommend you use a 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.430
 well bright color down and in the oven 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.830
 one darker in my case I chose the color 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.050
 blue that is the darkest I have in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.360
 the logo on the top 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.700
 the bright yellow I used it in the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 bottom part and the green one in 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.610
 sides of the fish 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.060
 and once we have finished 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.729
 paint we can make your eyes with 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 indelible marking other products or 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.189
 also to paint with some kind of 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.860
 paint can paint it with a spray or 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.759
 with what you like good if we take the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.190
 video 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.190
 give him like subscribe share and comment 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.140
 but before we leave, I'll leave it with 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.140
 a video in which we tried decoys 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.870
 now brings another one for the looks very 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.420
 Revolting the new 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.650
 we have other themes as we see 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.730
 highlights the path we did and a very 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.730
 cute transport 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.230
 an example of how we get 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's talk 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.980
 tell it 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.980
 good that splashes faith
