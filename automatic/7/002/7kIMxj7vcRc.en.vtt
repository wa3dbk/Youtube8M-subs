00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello everyone today I'm going to teach 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.370
 transform a normal blouse to a blouse 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.670
 of pregnancy 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.300
 Here we let a normal blouse 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.020
 to doubt it 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.020
 in 2 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.249
 let's help with the pins 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.160
 we take the mold paper that is two 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 degrees 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 for pronovias 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 we put our blouse 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.600
 and we draw 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.740
 in the session 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.839
 now 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.839
 we take a squad 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 and at the height of the chair of the cisa 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.290
 let's trace 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 we go 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.430
 to climb 2 centimeters 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.619
 two centimeters and we give it the form 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.619
 in this way 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.600
 we justify 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.600
 and we have marked 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 now 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 j 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.040
 well now we cut the mold paper 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:11.190
 we put the tape measure of this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.220
 way we have 39.5 we divide it by 4 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.580
 that we will get something out of 9.9 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.580
 why 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.090
 two 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.180
 12 34 now 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.180
 let's dial with the rule 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.680
 and then with a squad 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.000
 let's mark in this way 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.290
 the other measure we are going to mark it 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.070
 in the same way 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.070
 up here where we have searched 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.989
 let's cut those three lines 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.290
 well now we already cut it I forgot 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.540
 tell him that the average here is 30 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.439
 centimeters and from there they just squared 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.439
 now we take 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.920
 the mold paper 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.030
 to place the tickets 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.030
 let's paste 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.609
 in this way 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.069
 we are going to give him bold ex of 7 centimeters 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.250
 7 centimeters 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 well now I finished here you give him 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.670
 one way to follow the other 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.670
 to another similar cut 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.290
 now let's cut well here now 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.110
 we have the cut pepero now we get 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.350
 the 2 to cut the fabric here I have 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.350
 black fabric also that double 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.360
 I will place the mold 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 although it will not move this possible 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.130
 I'm going to mark 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.160
 let 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.380
 now if you want to cover yourself 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.470

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.570
 we can download you can download 53 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.180
 centimeters what you want we are going 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.610
 to lower the 5 centimeters 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.219
 this we do have to respect 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.219
 then from there we will give the form 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.980
 we're going to give you two centimeters of 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:10.300
 stitching for bending 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.650
 two centimeters of sewing 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.650

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.010

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.580
 let's count 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.300
 and here we have it cut 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.819
 now we are going to lower to join the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.930
 blouse we measure height of the armhole here 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:44.930
 we join and we finish with riveting equal 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.840
