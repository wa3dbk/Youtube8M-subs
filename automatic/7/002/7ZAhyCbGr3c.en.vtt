00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.549

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.190
 inside does not seem like a very 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.690
 simple that we say good was that or 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.270

 the whole building is burning fast 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.739

 there is a quick fire save the 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.930
 women and children first I think that is already 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.460
 clear who is the culprit the black of 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.370
 there you are under arrest but if I do not 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.670

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.250
 a fast black all catch that 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.800

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.650
