00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.960
 good now is very good to everyone here 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.850
 we are as you see video with the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.580
 sniper not example and with that of that 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.920
 ere this time I bring you a nuclear with 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 the sniper and cap 40 since he killed 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.110
 a few with her but the truth 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 is that I liked it a lot because the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.050
 most of the casualties are those of some 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.030
 so cool the gun then obviously 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 they are because I would have to kill with the 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.830
 pistol face to face style this so 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 I would tell it like I do not know how to nuclear 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.540
 sniper as well as after 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 the nuclear plus those that I 30 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 what do you need to kill to be able to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 get out of the nuclear I kill 10 more since 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.550
 It's a streak of 40 and I do not know if they'll reach 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 30 of them be with the sniper 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.090
 but if not then they do not stay so 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.079
 minus half of them yes they are a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.790
 Frank 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.190
 so nacho had long since 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.200
 they were already looking for a nuclear with the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 of that ere with some sniper with 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.719
 I do not know or with a sniper is the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.309
 truth and that also came out then 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.539
 pretty cool how I got this one like 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.199
 I said with a few shots 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.299
 quite powerful extreme style 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.150
 for example and the truth that makes 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.750
 days that I already have the nuclear stored 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.730
 I already have since before e3 and had 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.470
 thought about commenting them up the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.810
 I was there but I do not know how he gave me 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 for keeping me saying the best comment to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 the turn since I was commenting about 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.570
 how many videos is nuclear if the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.650
 I wanted to comment quite pretty cool and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.260
 I did not give you my impression of everything 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.570
 what is happening now with the theme of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.850
 the nuclear ones in the channel since many 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.220
 of you prefer games 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.790
 complete others we prefer to see nuclear 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.410
 no short streaks and especially one 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.900
 shorties you have from 4 to 30 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.910
 I even put the ones he killed afterwards 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.119
 of killing those he killed with the nuclear 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.190
 but still, yes, many of you prefer 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.380
 whole games that put you the streak 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.640
 of the nuclear and that is better not me what 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.990
 what I do is how I like the two 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.490
 things many times you have games 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.040
 whole as the one who is humble the scale 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.900
 I've uploaded the video before the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.220
 golden scale and then also 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.619
 I prefer here you have a quick what 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.860
 to act with the gun what I have 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.720
 said before necessary drops with the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.380
 gun of the ones that do not then are with the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.380
 sniper like 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.470
 but I was not commenting on what was said 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.970
 Many prefer that, as always, 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.970
 I try to have to talk varied not 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.790
 I can have everyone happy with 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.790
 all aspects and always on the channel 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.000
 the truth that especially surprised me 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.920
 that the shots that I took out I stay 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.140
 in this area 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.520
 you can call it how you want to 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.020
 play tactical I the truth I saw it 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.810
 more like controlling it I expose that 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.800
 I had a back just to the left 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 As you can see now, repression is 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.950
 left and when that was finished 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.020
 they appeared behind you see it and just 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.989
 well where I am now there was a point 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.180
 hot and came after me all the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.269
 true that especially on a map like 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.190
 this one that they added very very open then 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.959
 having the position is also I can 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.459
 tell from there the hot spot that comes out 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.170
 forward as it has just now 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.600
 appear mine responds is within 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.180
 that house and had like the perfect point 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.360
 to be able to get me out because the nuclear and it's 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.450
 as in what happened but also 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.730
 I have 25 as you see 26 with this if I do not 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.380
 wrong and these are the moments about 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.540
 all with a sniper when you're 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.319
 more loaded than three I see that he shoots me 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.269
 a guy here there is another I kill him and 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.970
 I get another uve sat and already the only thing that 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.980
 I wanted to be calm, it was raining 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.380
 grenades from all sides came to me 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.810
 by all the sites also 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.880
 I wanted nuclear and in the end I got 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.330
 killing this one that cost me sweat 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.330
 tears and come on it cost me up almost 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.520
 lose control because my mind 18 with 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.770
 him with the shotgun that almost killed me and 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.270
 I get nuclear and as you have seen and 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.740
 I already had what I wanted so I say 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.030
 Well, you already spoil me all the points that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.040
 a gun I will try to do now 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.090
 something cool with the sniper I'm all going 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.850
 to try to kill all you can 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.290
 with him and that 's what we did now you go 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.900
 to see a little hairline with the franc 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.350
 that also took me quite cool and the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.190
 final they kill me so for whatever it is with 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.790
 a quick also puts me in a stand like that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.320
 was they got a good one for 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.510
 finish the game so I nacho al 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.080
 I hope that you have cooled the nuclear 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.910
 it's true that I have nuclear ones like that and 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.460
 quite with pretty curious things in 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.140
 the channel that you will have these days and nobody 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.020
 more explained we know nuclear side many 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.700
 you asked me for a sniper so I did 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.770
 what I could to bring the sniper 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.140
 and gun so I did what I could to 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.140
 bring them in and this is where they put me 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.490
 famous and I stay until the camera because 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.490
 this guy killed me
