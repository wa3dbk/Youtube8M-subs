00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:11.210
 tattoos for several thousand years and 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.210
 they have never been so popular 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.840
 every eighth adult american 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.849
 possessor of at least one 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.250
 tattoos are 40 million people what 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.890
 it's not entirely clear when you find out 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.580
 how painful is getting such and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.980
 then they are forever mechanical 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.760
 rattlesnake which releases ink 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 instead of poison 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.570
 how does this machine all you need 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.239
 to fill a picture pierce it 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.799
 epidermis or outer layer of skin and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.150
 place paint 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:57.970
 dermis second layer of skin approximately in 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:04.299
 millimeter from the surface of this machine 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:06.939
 does it about 50 times a second it 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.890
 mean every minute in your chair 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.890
 pierce 3000 times 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 and if the tattoo takes three hours then 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.130
 it means 540,000 punctures 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 however there is still a problem with accuracy 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.090
 can not make a detailed picture 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.620
 like this without microscopic 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.260
 accuracy 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.480
 tattoo machine controls the depth 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.840
 speed and color accurate to 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.840
 millimeter 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.430
 it hurts as the selection of the machine sound as the selection 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.430
 cars and it looks no better 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 it all starts with a handful of details and 1 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.000
 elastic band 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.550
 there are three main details the basis 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.490
 needle mechanism of course this needle 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.979
 it is soldered to the metal foot 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.760
 connected to the rod this part and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.760
 doing all the work 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.780
 spring attach rod except 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:29.530
 a piece of metal like a hare 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.580
 ear with holes well and gum it does not 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 gives the needle too briskly to go away 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.670
 no extraneous needle lines in such 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.290
 typewriter 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.340
 razor sharp and stainless steel 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 no ordinary sewing needles 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.610
 modern needles are produced in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.580
 several species they may look 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.160
 like from the middle ages but they answer 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 the highest and most delicate requirements 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.910
 needles make small 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.560
 consecutive holes in the skin 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.420
 put a sewing machine leaking 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.790
 the cloth 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.920
 ink is drawn into the skin like a thread when 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.110
 every stitch 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.600
 during this process the skin must be 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.540
 taut if it miss that needle 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.590
 stuck in the ink will spread and will 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 mess 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.060
 let's see how it works from the very beginning 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.120
 beginnings 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.030
 it all starts with sketches to 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.300
 mark the contour of the machine is configured 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.400
 to draw a clear line 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.280
 a tip-like needle is installed 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.170
 a pencil 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.480
 when the contour is ready to hatch here 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.769
 need new teeth 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.080
 bar vegetable needles look like a comb 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.950
 the more needles in the nozzle the more 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.750
 ink under the skin a few needles 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:23.830
 making a hole which 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:27.990
 at the same time filled the needles dial 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.990
 speed using electromagnetism 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.190
 it controls the power source 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.129
 foot pedal switches the motor on and off 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.169
 The speed of such a machine is approximately 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.190
 4000 rpm 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:55.099
 sports car at such speeds 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.099
 accelerates to 150 kilometers per hour 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.630
 electricity goes by wire to these 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.720
 coils that creates a magnetic field 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:12.350
 she pulls the rod and makes 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.990
 needle bite into skin when rod 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.540
 hits the coil it breaks 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.450
 electrical circuit 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.300
 the magnet turns off and the rod again 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.140
 gets in place when he touches it 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.260
 contact 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.860
 the magnet turns on again and the vowel 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.230
 hitting the cannon needle speed in this 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.600
 typewriter so high that comparable to 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.870
 hummingbird wing stroke speed 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.870
 but the wings of the bird do not cause burning pain 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.730
 in a world where all these works are possible 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.910
 arts 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:53.970
 Only for connoisseurs for recognition in 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.970
 society 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.680
 spiritual dedication 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.430
 generic traditions or just like 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.430
 spontaneous decision 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:12.080
 tattoos last victim on the way to 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:13.610
 self-expression this machine brought 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.310
 oldest art form 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.419
 to perfection with the help of several 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.419
 know how
