00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.509 
so this is an 8 inch I wish I went a
little<00:03:13.130> longer<00:03:13.519> I'm<00:03:14.299> not<00:03:14.989> knowledgeable<00:03:15.709> of

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
little longer I'm not knowledgeable of

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.810 
little longer I'm not knowledgeable of
weave<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> didn't<00:03:18.320> know<00:03:18.440> exactly<00:03:18.820> what

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
weave so I didn't know exactly what

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.949 
weave so I didn't know exactly what
length<00:03:20.209> was<00:03:20.720> needed<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:22.690> thought<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.840> 8

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
length was needed so I thought the 8

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.930 
length was needed so I thought the 8
inch<00:03:24.200> would<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.160> guy<00:03:25.340> at<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.609> store

inch would do it the guy at the store

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.569 
inch would do it the guy at the store
told<00:03:26.000> me<00:03:26.750> or<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.560> show<00:03:28.100> them<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.280> picture

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
head but to speed up the process you can

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.939 
head but to speed up the process you can
pop<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.120> in<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.300> microwave<00:05:27.719> pop<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.889> the

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
pop it in a microwave pop in the

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.909 
pop it in a microwave pop in the
microwave<00:05:29.190> for<00:05:29.490> about<00:05:29.880> 30<00:05:30.419> seconds<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.319> it

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
microwave for about 30 seconds and it

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.969 
microwave for about 30 seconds and it
will<00:05:32.039> allow<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.340> color<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.810> trick<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.710> hair<00:05:34.949> a

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
will allow the color to trick the hair a

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.330 
will allow the color to trick the hair a
lot<00:05:35.219> faster<00:05:35.909> and<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:36.750> therefore<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.889> get<00:05:38.099> more

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
lot faster and so therefore you get more

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.909

not on my head but on her own head the

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.070 
not on my head but on her own head the

some of her foundation so you just put a
little<00:06:10.919> foundation<00:06:11.330> where<00:06:12.330> that<00:06:13.050> lace<00:06:13.409> part
