nice for Peggy one blush and contour but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
nice for Peggy one blush and contour but
when<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.309> kind<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:07.070> do

when you do kind of like you know do

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
when you do kind of like you know do
that<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.360> pick<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> lot

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that to it because it will pick up a lot
