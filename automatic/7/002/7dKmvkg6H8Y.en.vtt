00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
is how you will structure your problem

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.279 
is how you will structure your problem
statement<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.590> define<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.820> wrong<00:00:48.289> where

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
statement you define what is wrong where

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
statement you define what is wrong where
it<00:00:49.500> happened<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> occurred<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.449> what

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
extent this is a problem and you define

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.150 
extent this is a problem and you define
I<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:57.559> each<00:00:58.559> problem

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I know that because each problem

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
I know that because each problem
statement<00:00:59.879> has<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> contain<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.469> in

other words what objects have the defect
what<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.640> defect<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.110> where

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
what is the defect you look at where

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.399 
what is the defect you look at where
that<00:01:07.890> effect<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:08.729> observed

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
that effect has been observed

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.539 
that effect has been observed
geographically<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.530> even<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.369> the

object<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.780> look<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
object you look at when this was a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
object you look at when this was a
problem<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.720> observed<00:01:16.320> what

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
problem when was it first observed what

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.490 
problem when was it first observed what
is<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> history<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> pattern<00:01:18.500> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
is the history is there a pattern you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
is the history is there a pattern you
then<00:01:19.740> define<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> problem

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
then define how much is this a problem

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.710 
then define how much is this a problem
how<00:01:22.140> many<00:01:22.409> objects<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.670> defects<00:01:24.390> how

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
how many objects have these defects how

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.140 
how many objects have these defects how
many<00:01:24.930> defects<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> each<00:01:25.860> object<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
many defects and each object is there a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.960 
many defects and each object is there a
trend<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> ask<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
trend then you ask how do I know this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.630 
trend then you ask how do I know this
what<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> standard<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.100> fail<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what is the standard that we fail to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.780

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
define what is wrong where the problem

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.990 
define what is wrong where the problem
occurred<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.619> problem<00:02:02.009> occurred<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
extent of the problem and how I know

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.529
