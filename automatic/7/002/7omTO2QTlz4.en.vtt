00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.190
 hello hello to all my friends on youtube 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.109
 welcome the new video tutorial 6-10 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.090
 tutorials had been some time 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.220
 absent from my youtube videos because 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 I was sick and for questions 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.610
 of time I had almost no time to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.070
 do videos then this video is 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.890
 about sony xperia m about how 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.340
 make it root superuser 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.859
 so then all once and for all 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.689
 know how to do it in the description 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.510
 of this video I'm going to leave the link of 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.140
 Download an application that is called 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.210
 flama root 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 is this application that you see here 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 installed 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 there is rock drama 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.219
 there is the application before installing 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.339
 the application will go to configurations 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.800
 then they go to the last options 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.300
 where it says development options there 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.649
 they will enable the options of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.820
 development in this case are already 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:13.280
 enabled and they will activate the option of 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.280
 debug usb accept 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.980
 when activating the debug option usb 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.170
 are going to install the application so 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.690
 root once installed, they will not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.420
 open they will connect your phone 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.120
 to the computer they will open then the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 root application and they will choose 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.170
 sing way 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.640
 wait a few seconds 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.710
 and here we get a message that we 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.720
 says explore turned out and tells us shops is 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.140
 when it appears then it means that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:02.340
 we already have the superuser enabled 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.030
 additional good is going to show you that with 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.310
 this application the cpu zeta 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.770
 let's open the download by the play 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 Normal store here will show us the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.790
 type of machine that we have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.090
 will show us which processor we have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.580
 to stories how many megahertz to how many 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.640
 frequency runs our processor which 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 is the manufacturer how much two cores 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.940
 we have what are the cores let's see the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.220
 temperature the load the speed of 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 load if a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.720
 processor or the two processors the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 clock speed 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.220
 we will be able to see 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.080
 and the gpu 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.510
 in this case we can see double 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.130
 processor is a snapdragon s4 to 972 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.970
 megahertz 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.360
 what is soria xperia m 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.950
 gpu render in this case would be for 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.650
 games is a drained 305 maker which 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.590
 as we see that only the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.050
 first core or the pq not only of the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.810
 processors 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.780
 the system 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.640
 we can see that they are and we can see the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 phone reference 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840
 this application is very useful when they go to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.630
 acquire a phone because it's going to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.790
 show the information completely 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.580
 detailed about what we have in 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.420
 our hands in this case we can see 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.610
 that I have 800 4 megabytes of ram they're never going to 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.330
 make the exact 1024 that is the tour 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.800
 but it is cataloged as if it were a giga 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.800
 We can also check if we have 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.430
 full root access 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.030
 as in this case of root access and it's 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 we can see battery information 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.859
 information of proximity sensors and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.859
 we turn it of umbrella turned towards 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.989
 forward backward the sensor 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.600
 proximity to those who will be changing 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.600
 information 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.540
 as we move it and 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.510
 about shows us information about the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.580
 cpu z 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.310
 well my friends from youtube that has been 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.220
 all about this root access for the sony 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.830
 xperia m I hope they work 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 the questions I can do in my 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.160
 twitter on my twitter account too 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.660
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.700
 video and 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.430
 if you like this video they can give you 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.020
 share can give you like 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.570
 please do not forget that commenting is 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.340
 thank friends we'll see you in a next 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.960
 video in the next video I will come 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 with the memory exchange is for the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.350
 sony xperia m I already discovered it and I'm going to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.830
 share with all of you thank you and 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.830
 until next time
