to<00:02:31.360> dear<00:02:31.540> more<00:02:31.720> engineering<00:02:32.170> we've<00:02:33.130> got<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to dear more engineering we've got the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.480 
to dear more engineering we've got the
CD<00:02:33.640> here<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> frequencies<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:36.220> tone

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
CD here with the frequencies of a tone

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.030 
CD here with the frequencies of a tone
that<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:36.910> need<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:39.030> things<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.180> area

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that we need just the things on area

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.260 
that we need just the things on area
unfortunately<00:02:42.040> we've<00:02:42.520> only<00:02:42.610> got<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.000> bass

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
unfortunately we've only got the bass

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.750 
unfortunately we've only got the bass
amp<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.930> one<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.320> we're<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.310> gonna<00:02:45.460> use

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
amp for this one so we're just gonna use

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.800 
amp for this one so we're just gonna use
our<00:02:46.000> trick<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.540> which<00:02:46.960> is<00:02:47.110> 40<00:02:47.440> Hertz<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:49.660> is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
our trick one which is 40 Hertz this is

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.790 
our trick one which is 40 Hertz this is
the<00:02:49.990> stereo

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
the stereo

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.040 
the stereo
we've<00:02:51.430> just<00:02:51.760> received<00:02:52.360> everything<00:02:52.600> back<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
we've just received everything back to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:04.470 
we've just received everything back to
zero<00:02:53.970> flattened<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.030> everything

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.690 

but<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.510> set<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> frequency<00:03:06.110> cross<00:03:07.100> over<00:03:07.490> here

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
but I set the frequency cross over here

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.030 
but I set the frequency cross over here
