00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 This woman won't even know what hit her. 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.540
 It will just be a great wave of toughness! 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.760

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.400
 Weak little man who ever was! 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.900
 But I swear! 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.420

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.060
 I can't hear you about the sound of how much - Be- A good man I am! 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.840
 Okay .. We didn't beat the grass (+100 points !, Total points: 100) 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 We hit a line in the grass! 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 I couldn't even beat more! 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060
 Okay, let's go inside and see if my wife is in there! 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.940
 Of course she is! 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.320
 Lo- Oh what !! 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.920
 No- We must have the post first! 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.760
 Look! 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.080
 Thhsss ... 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.680
 *Awkward silence* 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.520
 Woo-Waa A-aa -... 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.660
 We have no record! 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.460
 And also! 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.560
 We live at the end of the universe! 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.100

 Wife: Throw out these stupid cups! 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.900
 Excuse me?! 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640
 These are from my high school days! 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.360
 Oh- It was two years ago ... 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.040
 They are here from my high school days !! 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.440
 I was actually a * Something I don't like * Champion! 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.140
 I know! 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.640
 It's not a normal thing, uh- where you live. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.200
 But when you go to high school, 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.700
 BOSS 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.260
 Okay, we gotta be a good man! 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 We must not say anything bad about my wife! 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.320
 Even if she is a little- OHHHHH! 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.100
 Hey! Look! 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.880

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.080
 All bills are paid (+25 !, Total Points: 125) 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 I'm a good man! 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 Heeeej! 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 Sweetheart! 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 Wife: Stop blocking the TV! 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 Well, sorry, Jesus Christ! 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.980
 A year ago. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 Wife: This story is SPIRIT, nobody wants to hear it! 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.300
 Why am I married to this woman ?! 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160
 So, to be fair, look straight at her. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.580
 She is another BITCH, but just look at them! 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.440
 DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMNNNNNNN 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.400
 Ask her about the bill. 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.680
 Oh God, like that. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.300
 Wife: Do something about that bill! 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 What is this bill for? 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 Did you get a new masseur named Steve ?! 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 I told you I didn't want you to go close to that guy! 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.400
 He is very "good". 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.500
 And I think he has one thing for you! 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.420
 * Normal human washing * 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.500
 This is how I "wash" up. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 Apparently. 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.540
 "Take out the garbage" 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.560
 Can I put my wife down in that bag? 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740
 For it would REALLY be taking out the garbage! 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.700
 *Evil laughter* 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.600
 Uhm ... 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.460
 Sea- Sweet Treasure? 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 I go upstairs and ... take a bath? 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.220
 Is it okay? 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.560
 *Silence* 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.160
 Okay, yeah, yeah. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 * Laughs at ... joy? * 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 Oh my God, it's like seeing two cardboard boxes having sex! 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.540
 * Okay, he laughs a little too much joy now! * 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 I knew she was cheating on me with Steve !! 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.380
 I told you !! 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.860
 That you should not go close to him !! 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.820
 "Take your gun" 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.320

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.760
 Wo- o- o- What- a- a- a- WHAT !? 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 "Shoot her" 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.580
 SHOOTING HERE!

 I go upstairs, take a bath ... 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.620
 Is it okay? 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.920
