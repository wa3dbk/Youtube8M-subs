 has undergone card you overpass however when 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 this important part has become and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.230
 update sniper rifles sight 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.910
 which now acquired a new mechanic 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.680
 according to professional players in 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.239
 eSports analysts like 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 changes sniper rifles and not 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.309
 completely correct from the side 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.290
 developers 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.210
 players now move much harder 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.340
 will be induced on the opponent as 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.110
 The scope itself becomes blurred and only 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.030
 positional game with the same gdp will 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.860
 extremely promising but immediately worth it 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.780
 note that to this option about players 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.640
 will be able to adapt very quickly and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.710
 in just a couple of weeks everything will rise 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.509
 to their seats and all viewers will again be able 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.110
 watch incredible bugs from this on 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.880
 first glance 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.470
 complicated goes well and as for 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.900
 cards kindly become significant 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.610
 changes undergone a patent and which 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.170
 Now hold much harder during 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.149
 anyway passive protection circuit 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 will not work as well as 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.630
 it was before we immediately note that similar 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.070
 changes were made based on 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.780
 repeated requests themselves 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.970
 professionals who occasionally 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.800
 find imbalances in new maps from 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.630
 the authors of the game Well, the conclusion from this is possible 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.819
 do only one update 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 essential important and interesting and therefore 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.090
 the game continues to gain momentum but 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.280
 authors continue to invent all new 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.610
 and new chips for professional 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 players 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.000
 quake live continues preparing for 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.560
 transition to the steam platform 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 the next game changes were made 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
 the mechanics of the shooter itself one of these 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.320
 moments from both nicks while holding 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.330
 buttons forward and jump now you can 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.710
 make this the so-called bani-hop that 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.930
 gives you the opportunity to get double 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.880
 movement speed command added 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.680

 primary to secondary weapons on 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.010
 by default this f button 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.630
 however, one of the main highlights of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.310
 The latest update has become the base 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.090
 for each weapon separately what with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.280
 perspective will be able to increase efficiency 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.170
 action in the game is also worth noting that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.090
 shooter developers have periodically become 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.830
 make changes and add maps 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 new weapon and little by little change 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.280
 gameplay of the game if not drastically 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.990
