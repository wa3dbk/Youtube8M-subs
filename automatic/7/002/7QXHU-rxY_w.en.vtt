horribly<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.859> sheds<00:03:55.100> enough<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.549> where<00:03:55.760> I

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
horribly but it sheds enough to where I

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.039 
horribly but it sheds enough to where I
don't<00:03:56.810> reach<00:03:57.019> for<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:57.620> much<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.910> if<00:03:59.600> it

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
don't reach for it as much but if it

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.080 
don't reach for it as much but if it
shed<00:04:00.590> its<00:04:00.620> shed<00:04:01.190> in<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.400> beginning<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.880> still

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
shed its shed in the beginning and still

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.539 
shed its shed in the beginning and still
sheds<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.600> little<00:04:02.900> bit<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:03.590> not<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.950> whole<00:04:04.370> lot

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
sheds a little bit but not a whole lot

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.020 
sheds a little bit but not a whole lot
not<00:04:04.820> like<00:04:05.030> my<00:04:05.209> Tom<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.900> brushes<00:04:06.500> shed<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.370> all

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
not like my Tom for brushes shed it all

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.780 
not like my Tom for brushes shed it all
the<00:04:08.239> time<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.200> one<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.530> feel<00:04:09.829> is<00:04:10.100> compared

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
the time so this one I feel is compared

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.039 
the time so this one I feel is compared
to<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:10.970> top<00:04:11.150> four<00:04:11.390> these<00:04:11.600> are<00:04:11.780> going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.959> be

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
to the top four these are going to be

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.229 
to the top four these are going to be
better<00:04:12.200> quality<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.980> mean<00:04:13.640> they're<00:04:13.820> not<00:04:13.970> as

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
better quality I mean they're not as

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.719 
better quality I mean they're not as
pretty<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:15.290> me<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.039> as<00:04:16.160> pretty<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:16.579> the

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
pretty to me and not as pretty as the

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.380 
pretty to me and not as pretty as the
Tom<00:04:16.910> Ford

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
Tom Ford

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.569 
Tom Ford
but<00:04:17.780> their<00:04:18.109> functionality<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.100> quality

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
but their functionality and the quality

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.420 
but their functionality and the quality
is<00:04:19.609> better<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.930> me<00:04:21.109> so<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.859> one<00:04:22.039> I<00:04:22.070> would<00:04:22.190> use

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
is better to me so this one I would use

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.670 
is better to me so this one I would use
for<00:04:22.460> blush<00:04:22.880> it's<00:04:23.360> gonna<00:04:23.599> pack<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.110> blush<00:04:24.409> a

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
for blush it's gonna pack on blush a

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.350 
for blush it's gonna pack on blush a
little<00:04:24.740> bit<00:04:25.250> more<00:04:25.460> heavier<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.150> have<00:04:26.270> to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
little bit more heavier so you have to

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.980 
little bit more heavier so you have to
be<00:04:26.479> light<00:04:26.690> with

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
be light with

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.990 
be light with
because<00:04:27.259> it<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> dense<00:04:27.889> brush<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.550> would

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
because it is a dense brush I would

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.400 
because it is a dense brush I would
probably<00:04:29.180> just<00:04:29.389> only<00:04:29.690> use<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.900> with<00:04:30.080> liquid

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
probably just only use this with liquid

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.469 
probably just only use this with liquid
and<00:04:30.560> maybe<00:04:30.680> blending<00:04:31.099> out<00:04:31.250> cream<00:04:31.639> but<00:04:32.270> this

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
and maybe blending out cream but this

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.330 
and maybe blending out cream but this
one<00:04:32.660> right<00:04:32.780> here<00:04:33.020> this<00:04:33.289> one<00:04:33.349> shed<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.099> maybe

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
one right here this one shed it maybe

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.510 
one right here this one shed it maybe
one<00:04:34.669> or<00:04:34.789> two<00:04:34.990> hairs<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.530> was<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:37.009> and<00:04:37.250> I

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
one or two hairs and that was it and I

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.249 
one or two hairs and that was it and I
haven't<00:04:37.819> noticed<00:04:37.970> any<00:04:38.270> shedding<00:04:38.690> sense<00:04:38.960> but

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
haven't noticed any shedding sense but

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.839 
haven't noticed any shedding sense but
this<00:04:39.500> one<00:04:39.770> compared<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.430> one<00:04:40.610> she<00:04:40.729> has

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
this one compared to this one she has

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.320 
this one compared to this one she has
very<00:04:41.180> very<00:04:41.539> little<00:04:42.169> if<00:04:42.349> not<00:04:42.590> at<00:04:42.889> all<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:43.759> this

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
very very little if not at all so this

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.180 
very very little if not at all so this
would<00:04:44.509> definitely<00:04:44.720> be<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.289> repurchase<00:04:45.740> for<00:04:46.069> me

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
would definitely be a repurchase for me

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.820 
would definitely be a repurchase for me
I<00:04:46.220> do<00:04:46.340> plan<00:04:46.819> to<00:04:47.210> hopefully<00:04:48.729> get<00:04:50.590> another<00:04:51.590> one

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
I do plan to hopefully get another one

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.580 
I do plan to hopefully get another one
of<00:04:51.949> these<00:04:52.069> when<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.360> have<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> little<00:04:54.169> chunk<00:04:54.440> of

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
of these when I have a little chunk of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.920 
of these when I have a little chunk of
change<00:04:54.740> laying<00:04:55.400> around<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:56.030> I'm<00:04:56.120> going<00:04:56.630> brush

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
change laying around and I'm going brush

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.360 
change laying around and I'm going brush
crazy<00:04:57.259> again<00:04:57.590> I'll<00:04:57.770> get<00:04:57.889> another<00:04:58.009> one<00:04:58.250> of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
crazy again I'll get another one of

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.999 
crazy again I'll get another one of
these<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:59.449> one<00:04:59.659> right<00:04:59.840> here<00:05:00.199> I<00:05:00.229> will<00:05:00.650> not<00:05:00.680> be

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
these this one right here I will not be

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.680 
these this one right here I will not be
repurchasing<00:05:01.699> another<00:05:01.970> one<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.270> these<00:05:02.360> this

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
repurchasing another one of these this

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.899 
repurchasing another one of these this
one<00:05:02.900> also<00:05:03.110> stains<00:05:03.620> really<00:05:04.069> easy<00:05:04.310> as<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> little

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
one also stains really easy as a little

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.210 
one also stains really easy as a little
harder<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.330> get<00:05:05.479> clean<00:05:05.949> they're<00:05:06.949> both

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
harder to get clean they're both

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.309 
harder to get clean they're both
excellent<00:05:07.729> brushes<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.479> just<00:05:08.870> feel<00:05:09.020> like<00:05:09.139> this

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
excellent brushes I just feel like this

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.809 
excellent brushes I just feel like this
one<00:05:09.530> sheds<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:10.069> little<00:05:10.280> bit<00:05:10.400> more<00:05:10.580> which<00:05:10.789> is

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
one sheds a little bit more which is

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.760 
one sheds a little bit more which is
