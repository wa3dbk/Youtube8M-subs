00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
real quick they don't usually flick that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.410 
real quick they don't usually flick that
quick<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.480> sped<00:04:13.990> up<00:04:14.020> about<00:04:14.790> 50<00:04:15.790> times<00:04:16.000> to

the<00:04:16.540> normal<00:04:16.870> speed<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:18.120> then<00:04:19.120> at<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.359> end<00:04:19.390> of

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
the normal speed and then at the end of

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.770 
the normal speed and then at the end of
the<00:04:20.560> little<00:04:21.280> thing<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.060> okay<00:04:22.300> let's<00:04:22.510> start

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.050 
the little thing and okay let's start
and<00:04:23.140> then<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.470> brought<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.830> Windows<00:04:24.160> 8.1<00:04:24.400> as

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
and then you brought to Windows 8.1 as

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.290 
and then you brought to Windows 8.1 as
you<00:04:25.480> see<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.810> start<00:04:26.080> buttons<00:04:26.440> back<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.860> there

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
and it's all the same as Windows 8.1 so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.460 
and it's all the same as Windows 8.1 so
there<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.110> go

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
there you go

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.760
