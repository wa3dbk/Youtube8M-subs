00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
stubborn fog that's still the case we're

still<00:00:38.190> looking<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.850> warm<00:00:39.149> temperatures

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
still looking at well warm temperatures

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in fact actually a little cooler as we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
again more cooling on the way we'll have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
again more cooling on the way we'll have
the<00:00:51.840> details<00:00:51.960> coming<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> little

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the details coming up in just a little

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
the details coming up in just a little
bit<00:00:53.520> Silvia<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.739> familiar

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
bit Silvia back to you I'm very familiar

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
bit Silvia back to you I'm very familiar
with<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> Bay<00:00:56.579> Area<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> sure<00:00:57.539> sure<00:00:58.199> did

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
with the Bay Area and it sure sure did

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
with the Bay Area and it sure sure did
that<00:00:58.859> fog<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.520> June<00:00:59.940> gloom<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> full

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that fog that June gloom it's in full

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
that fog that June gloom it's in full
effect<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.559> yes<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.789> in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
effect and yes we see it here in

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
effect and yes we see it here in
Southern<00:01:03.329> California<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:04.229> well<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> onshore

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
Southern California as well that onshore

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
Southern California as well that onshore
flow<00:01:05.339> kicking<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.119> there's<00:01:06.390> still<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
flow kicking in and there's still that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
flow kicking in and there's still that
lag<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.320> between<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.890> cool<00:01:08.340> temperatures

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
lag time between the cool temperatures

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
lag time between the cool temperatures
sea<00:01:09.450> surface<00:01:09.630> temperatures<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.979> warmer

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
sea surface temperatures and the warmer

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920 
sea surface temperatures and the warmer
temperatures<00:01:11.790> over<00:01:12.090> land<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.630> why<00:01:12.780> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
temperatures over land so that's why we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
temperatures over land so that's why we
get<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.680> fog<00:01:14.010> especially

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
get a little bit of that fog especially

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
get a little bit of that fog especially
in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> May<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.570> June<00:01:16.110> months<00:01:16.439> because

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in the May and June months because

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
in the May and June months because
there's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> big<00:01:17.549> difference<00:01:17.850> between<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.689> two

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there's a big difference between the two

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
there's a big difference between the two
and<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.470> creates<00:01:19.830> instability<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.330> little

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and that creates instability so a little

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
and that creates instability so a little
more<00:01:22.170> than<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> bargained<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
more than you bargained for there but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
more than you bargained for there but
just<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> let<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.659> off

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just want to let you know all right off

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.999 
just want to let you know all right off
in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> distance<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> little<00:01:25.680> bit<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> haze

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
in the distance a little bit of haze
