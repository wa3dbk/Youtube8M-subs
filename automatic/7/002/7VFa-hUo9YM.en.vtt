00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.750
 huge engines weighing tons and tons 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 innovations on every corner from today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 starts the 64 international automobile 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.949
 exhibition short iaa in hannover around 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 1900 exhibitors from 46 countries 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 present here the latest from 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 latest all commercial vehicles all around the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.720
 the visitor rush is great 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 no miracle even for the lay there 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 to see and try a lot here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.859
 the visitor can participate in this simulation 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 For example, a new damping system 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 experience up close 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 the system can be activated by pressing a button 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980
 and turn off the difference 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 experience 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.629
 we want to attenuate the regulated area 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 Of course, what are the advantages 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.640
 just the safety aspect we are there 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.890
 but in the foreground 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.239
 of course also improved at the same time 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 comfort for the driver 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.949
 generally like to use simulation 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 worked on a new hybrid 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 system in which the visitor to the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.859
 platform is a small 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 City tour activated by 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 examples will then declare an hour 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 which stations save energy 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 or when the car completely on electro 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 surrounds this system that guarantees 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.150
 a 25 percent 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 Fuel savings therefore also one 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.310
 Co2 saving the advantage of the system 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.180
 is that we purely electric the engine 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.830
 can start 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.430
 we can do a very comfortable 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.260
 start stop system and implement this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.360
 strong engine generator helps us 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.000
 often who the cooperation performance that too 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.010
 use on the front axle and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 Dielectric big machine one 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.810
 permanent synchronous service as 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.520
 drive machine which ensures that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.110
 we can drive purely electric and 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.780
 high reparation services too 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.850
 can also be hybrid 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.649
 the buses of the future with the help of new 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.380
 developed engines would like that 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.790
 save 39 co2 emissions in the future 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.789
 we are mainly waiting in the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.800
 city area large exceptional popularity as we for 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.920
 in hybrid technology these are 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.110
 Issue buses and clear our message 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.570
 can get rid of that volvo on environment 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.989
 put environment changed and we with 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.670
 precede hybrid and from 2014 in 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.530
 city ​​bus area only hybrid buses 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.610
 that we have just seen 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.380
 have that one does not have only one 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.769
 tiny fraction of what the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.720
 Altogether she has to offer a fair 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.519
 260,000 square feet so still each 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.900
 lots to try for yourself and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.400
 but they still have experience 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400
 until next week thursday time
