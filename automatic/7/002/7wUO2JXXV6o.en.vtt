 of the 3 thousand 500 emergencies 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 1,500 are in the American union which has generated several problems in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.039
 family dynamics of the community 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.500
 and in the development of their youth and children 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.370
 reality that offers them few opportunities 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.820
