all over the country but I have to say

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.899 
all over the country but I have to say
that<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.710> far<00:01:52.950> outweighed<00:01:53.369> by<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.820> of

congratula Tory email as well so let me
get<00:01:56.340> back<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.790> case<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> sticker

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
get back to this case into the sticker

get back to this case into the sticker
in<00:01:57.990> particular<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.680> said<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.119> thicker

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
in particular I said I like this thicker

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
in particular I said I like this thicker
and<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> sense<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.399> doesn't<00:02:02.610> go

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and I do in a sense it just doesn't go

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
and I do in a sense it just doesn't go
far<00:02:03.090> enough<00:02:03.149> no<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.810> mean<00:02:03.990> by<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
far enough no what do I mean by that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.590 
far enough no what do I mean by that
well<00:02:04.950> yes<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> book<00:02:05.579> does<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.000> material<00:02:06.479> on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
well yes the book does have material on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
well yes the book does have material on
evolution<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> biology<00:02:08.280> book<00:02:08.429> has

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
evolution but a biology book has

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
evolution but a biology book has
material<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> lot<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> topics<00:02:09.690> why<00:02:09.989> single

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
material and a lot of topics why single

material and a lot of topics why single
out<00:02:10.530> evolution<00:02:11.129> evolution<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> theory<00:02:12.840> it's

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
out evolution evolution is a theory it's

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.570 
out evolution evolution is a theory it's
sir

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
sir

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.310 
sir
he<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:14.420> actually<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> chapter

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
he is we actually have a chapter

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.410 
he is we actually have a chapter
entitled<00:02:15.520> evolutionary<00:02:16.520> theory<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> agree

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
entitled evolutionary theory so I agree

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.120 
entitled evolutionary theory so I agree
it's<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.720> theory<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.500> when<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.680> say<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
it's a theory but when you say it's a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.400 
it's a theory but when you say it's a
theory<00:02:19.370> not<00:02:19.640> affect<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.690> makes<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.110> sounds

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
theory not affect it makes it sounds

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.290 
theory not affect it makes it sounds
like<00:02:21.530> theories<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.190> facts<00:02:22.460> are<00:02:22.700> opposite

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
like theories and facts are opposite

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960 
like theories and facts are opposite
things<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.050> if<00:02:24.890> we're<00:02:25.190> really<00:02:25.370> sure<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.670> facts

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
things as if we're really sure of facts

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.030 
things as if we're really sure of facts
and<00:02:26.210> we're<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.140> sure<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:27.500> theories<00:02:27.860> in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and we're not so sure or theories in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.340 
and we're not so sure or theories in
fact<00:02:28.670> theory<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.420> science<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:29.990> higher

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
fact theory and science is a higher

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.770 
fact theory and science is a higher
level<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.220> understanding<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:32.540> facts

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
level of understanding and then facts

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.290 
level of understanding and then facts
because<00:02:32.990> what<00:02:33.140> theories<00:02:33.590> do<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.070> they<00:02:34.580> explain

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
because what theories do is they explain

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.450 
because what theories do is they explain
facts<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:35.930> unite<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:37.010> pointed<00:02:37.400> out

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
facts they unite them and I pointed out

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.190 
facts they unite them and I pointed out
to<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.760> reporter<00:02:38.270> if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.810> went<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.110> the

University of Georgia and you studied

University of Georgia and you studied
atomic<00:02:41.120> physics<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:42.170> would<00:02:42.320> take<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> course

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
atomic physics you would take a course

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.550 
atomic physics you would take a course
in<00:02:42.920> atomic<00:02:43.250> theory<00:02:43.840> there's<00:02:44.840> no<00:02:45.020> time<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
in atomic theory there's no time in the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.200 
in atomic theory there's no time in the
future<00:02:45.740> when<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.520> professor<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.150> to

future when the professor is going to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.060 
future when the professor is going to
change<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.750> name<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.080> course<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.710> atomic

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
change the name of that course to atomic

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.370 
change the name of that course to atomic
fact<00:02:49.520> because<00:02:50.330> that's<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.750> what<00:02:50.810> atomic

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
fact because that's not what atomic

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.530 
fact because that's not what atomic
theory<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.800> about<00:02:52.070> atomic<00:02:52.910> theory<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
theory is about atomic theory is a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.720 
theory is about atomic theory is a
system<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.080> explanations<00:02:54.770> that<00:02:54.980> explains

system of explanations that explains

system of explanations that explains
thousands<00:02:56.330> tens<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.780> thousands<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.410> facts

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
thousands tens of thousands of facts

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.920 
thousands tens of thousands of facts
about<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.490> nature<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.880> matter<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.510> that's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
about the nature of matter and that's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.840 
about the nature of matter and that's
what<00:03:00.110> evolutionary<00:03:00.680> theory<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
what evolutionary theory is like to but

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.830 
what evolutionary theory is like to but
when<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.060> get<00:03:02.150> right<00:03:02.209> down<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
when you get right down to it the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.540 
when you get right down to it the
sentence<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.290> bothered<00:03:03.709> me<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.070> most<00:03:04.100> is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
sentence that bothered me the most is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.449 
sentence that bothered me the most is
actually<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.570> third<00:03:05.810> one<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:07.070> reporter

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
actually the third one and the reporter

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.530 
actually the third one and the reporter
said<00:03:07.640> what<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.910> mean<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.030> don't<00:03:08.270> like

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
said what do you mean you don't like

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.600 
said what do you mean you don't like
open-mindedness<00:03:09.410> or<00:03:09.680> critical<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.310> said<00:03:10.520> no

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
open-mindedness or critical I said no

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.949 
open-mindedness or critical I said no
that's<00:03:10.730> not<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.970> at<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.270> do<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.780> know<00:03:11.840> what
