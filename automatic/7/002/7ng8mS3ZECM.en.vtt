00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.780
 since you are over here you do not have that 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.029
 game consoles and so on and so on 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.889
 with the title of the video says third 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.350
 season of the walking dead confirmed 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.939
 is already confirmed so it's good I do not know if 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.250
 it's going to be more or less the title but 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.289
 quite similar the joke is that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.670
 the third season of 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.890
 this game that has caught many 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.050
 people to many followers who have 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.150
 been thus entertained in what is a 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.110
 computer game or in which is in 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.810
 the Xbox or in the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.150
 tablets and phones that is already being in 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.390
 several devices we do not exist anymore 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.430
 in what is xbox one or playstation 4 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.550
 I 'm really not sure I do not have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.530
 none of their consoles but good is what 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.540
 that we're going to leave it afterwards right now 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.890
 we are going to read to you what is more than 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.230
 nothing the news that is why they are 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.940
 here but good by the way if who the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 three same there with their own 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 words or yes well I the most unfair and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.250
 making this video with my own 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 words I'm reading it and then the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.610
 I did little things of mine 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.290
 because this is what I want as it is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.759
 written there is enough in the description the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.490
 full story if you want to spend 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.530
 to see but good they say for all 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 those followers of the pertinences 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.320
 forgiveness of the little clÃ©mentine ok ok 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.840
 law will be pleased to know that during the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 san diego comic-con it has been confirmed that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 there will be a third season this 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 according to the information given during a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 panel by Robert Kirkman the creator of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.560
 the walking dead 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.030
 that's how the developer is currently 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 find celebrating the excellent 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.130
 comments that the penultimate episode of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 your video game has so the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 final chapter is still pending 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 is who will be the face of the next 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.160
 series of episodes so it's good this is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 more than anything let's say the news is not 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.240
 so long the news but more than anything 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 it's like to warn the joke I do not know how 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 I do not know how it ended in the second 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.690
 season or I do not know how far 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.220
 stayed since I only played the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.710
 first season and I played the first 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.840
 three episodes and I do not keep playing 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.820
 because I had to buy this in the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.930
 other episodes the other chapters more 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.539
 well they are not driving I think by 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.060
 chapters but I do not have to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.739
 buy the chapters and that you can 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.230
 buy as well as season pass or something like that 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.570
 I do not know what gives you all the chapters like that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.400
 those who are to come and things 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.770
 well when just the chapter was not 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 just like it came out let's say it when 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.750
 I was just coming out that but I do not know 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.820
 I left him there half-heartedly not really not 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 I followed up but they will be sent 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.840
 quite interesting enough a game 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 quite interesting curious about the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280
 game method that I had really in 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.660
 a very particular game that you had 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.610
 to make decisions and it was going to happen and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.020
 affecting the story and that too 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.960
 chose let's say what you wanted to say 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 things of that style really 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.530
 I was quite curious what is the game 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 but well this is more than anything 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.190
 news in case they want to see it there is a 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
 tweet out there good the page is the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.650
 tweet there that in which they said yes 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.560
 it is totally confirmed that the room 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.050
 be that well let's say that they were already 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.120
 to take out soon when he does not say no 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.310
 says there is no date for this this third 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110
 season but wait for the and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.090
 soon it will be but good 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980
