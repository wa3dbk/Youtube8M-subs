00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
different color and finally it's CL 4

which<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.040> different<00:03:17.280> from<00:03:17.489> what<00:03:17.730> we're

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
which is different from what we're

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.130 
which is different from what we're
getting<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> high<00:03:18.420> grade<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.019> can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
getting in the high grade but you can

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.420 
getting in the high grade but you can
still<00:03:19.320> see<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.680> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.829> look<00:03:20.010> pretty<00:03:20.040> cool

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
still see it's going to look pretty cool

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.860 
still see it's going to look pretty cool
hopefully<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> make<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.480> black

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
hopefully it's going to make that black

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.270 
hopefully it's going to make that black
or<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.230> black<00:03:22.410> underneath<00:03:22.739> will<00:03:23.010> make<00:03:23.160> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
or the black underneath will make it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.069 
or the black underneath will make it
look<00:03:23.430> pretty<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.700> some<00:03:24.390> silver<00:03:24.720> paint<00:03:24.750> or

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
look pretty good some silver paint or

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.569 
look pretty good some silver paint or
seals<00:03:25.350> underneath<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:25.860> sure<00:03:26.070> would<00:03:26.250> bring<00:03:26.459> it

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
seals underneath I'm sure would bring it

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.130 
seals underneath I'm sure would bring it
to<00:03:26.730> live<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> little<00:03:27.450> bit<00:03:27.600> more<00:03:27.750> luster

more<00:05:49.849> aerodynamic<00:05:50.849> which<00:05:51.840> is<00:05:52.020> going<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.289> lead

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
more aerodynamic which is going to lead

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.750 
more aerodynamic which is going to lead
me<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.830> verdict<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.430> can<00:05:53.580> guess<00:05:53.729> that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
me to a verdict that you can guess that

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.820 
me to a verdict that you can guess that
this<00:05:54.030> one<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.270> probably<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.840> pass<00:05:55.229> for<00:05:55.650> most

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
this one is probably a pass for most

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.439 
this one is probably a pass for most
people<00:05:56.220> there's<00:05:56.430> not<00:05:56.610> really<00:05:56.970> too<00:05:57.300> many

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
people there's not really too many

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.120 
people there's not really too many
reasons<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:57.870> pick<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.199> up<00:05:58.289> if<00:05:58.590> you're<00:05:58.979> going<00:05:59.070> to

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
reasons to pick it up if you're going to

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.560 
reasons to pick it up if you're going to
be<00:05:59.250> buying<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.550> AG<00:05:59.849> guy<00:06:00.000> friends<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.419> can

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
be buying the AG guy friends you can

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.120 
be buying the AG guy friends you can
just<00:06:00.750> add<00:06:00.960> your<00:06:01.229> army<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.650> have<00:06:01.770> more<00:06:02.010> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
just add your army and have more and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.129 
just add your army and have more and
more<00:06:02.190> for<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.490> reasonable<00:06:02.970> price<00:06:03.090> even<00:06:04.050> this

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
more for a reasonable price even this

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.600 
more for a reasonable price even this
one<00:06:04.320> which<00:06:04.470> I<00:06:04.560> really<00:06:04.830> wasn't<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.250> big<00:06:05.370> fan<00:06:05.430> of

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
one which I really wasn't a big fan of

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.159 
one which I really wasn't a big fan of
because<00:06:05.970> it<00:06:06.090> is<00:06:06.210> just<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.570> one<00:06:06.720> color<00:06:06.930> is

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
because it is just the one color is

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.570 
because it is just the one color is
growing<00:06:07.620> on<00:06:07.770> me<00:06:07.919> because<00:06:08.099> all<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.370> sudden

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
growing on me because all the sudden

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.550 
growing on me because all the sudden
we've<00:06:08.760> got<00:06:08.909> mass-produced<00:06:09.510> ones<00:06:09.780> if<00:06:10.440> you

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
we've got mass-produced ones if you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.559 
we've got mass-produced ones if you
wanted<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.830> add<00:06:10.919> some<00:06:11.099> yellow

wanted to add some yellow
to<00:06:11.689> this<00:06:11.779> you<00:06:11.960> could<00:06:12.050> certainly<00:06:12.229> bring<00:06:12.529> this

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
to this you could certainly bring this

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.339 
to this you could certainly bring this
guy<00:06:12.919> alive<00:06:13.219> but<00:06:14.029> for<00:06:14.179> the<00:06:14.270> Sonora<00:06:14.599> at<00:06:14.929> least<00:06:15.169> in

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.559 
of the bad guys for 1,300 yen you're
just<00:06:19.219> going<00:06:19.369> to<00:06:19.429> get<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:19.849> much<00:06:19.909> more<00:06:20.300> in<00:06:20.419> terms

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
just going to get so much more in terms

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.029 
just going to get so much more in terms
of<00:06:20.779> pose<00:06:21.020> ability<00:06:21.439> colors<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:21.979> everything

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
else out of this high grade then unless

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
you want to be at the supermarket

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.980

playing<00:06:25.429> the<00:06:25.580> arcade<00:06:25.879> game<00:06:26.089> I<00:06:26.330> don't<00:06:26.839> really

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
playing the arcade game I don't really

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.449 
playing the arcade game I don't really
see<00:06:27.080> too<00:06:27.409> much<00:06:27.559> of<00:06:27.619> a<00:06:27.770> point<00:06:27.919> in<00:06:28.099> getting<00:06:28.249> this

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459 
see too much of a point in getting this

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.429 
see too much of a point in getting this
now<00:06:29.119> that<00:06:29.149> could<00:06:29.449> change<00:06:29.659> their<00:06:29.929> generation

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
now that could change their generation

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.480 
now that could change their generation
as<00:06:30.589> this<00:06:30.740> will<00:06:30.949> probably<00:06:31.129> become<00:06:31.369> a

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
as this will probably become a

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.010 
as this will probably become a
mass-produced<00:06:32.029> suit<00:06:32.300> similar<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:32.839> the<00:06:32.929> way

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
mass-produced suit similar to the way

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.959 
mass-produced suit similar to the way
the<00:06:33.169> Zetas<00:06:33.349> stood<00:06:33.679> and<00:06:33.889> at<00:06:34.309> that<00:06:34.429> point<00:06:34.639> it<00:06:34.879> may

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
the Zetas stood and at that point it may

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.790 
the Zetas stood and at that point it may
be<00:06:35.029> a<00:06:35.119> lot<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.360> fun<00:06:35.479> it<00:06:36.229> does<00:06:36.379> have<00:06:36.559> a<00:06:36.589> few

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
be a lot of fun it does have a few

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.079 
be a lot of fun it does have a few
positives<00:06:37.429> like<00:06:37.639> the<00:06:37.759> fact<00:06:37.909> that<00:06:37.999> it's

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.089 
positives like the fact that it's

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:39.939 
positives like the fact that it's
actually<00:06:38.479> got<00:06:38.629> three<00:06:38.869> colors<00:06:39.139> in<00:06:39.319> there<00:06:39.499> you

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
actually got three colors in there you

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.350 
actually got three colors in there you
could<00:06:40.069> even<00:06:40.189> do<00:06:40.399> some<00:06:40.639> things<00:06:40.819> like<00:06:40.999> chop<00:06:41.209> out

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
could even do some things like chop out

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.999 
could even do some things like chop out
some<00:06:41.599> silver<00:06:41.959> foil<00:06:42.229> and<00:06:42.469> put<00:06:42.619> that<00:06:42.770> under

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
some silver foil and put that under

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.829 
some silver foil and put that under
there<00:06:43.159> and<00:06:43.309> just<00:06:43.969> generally<00:06:44.479> add<00:06:44.599> it<00:06:44.719> up

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839 
there and just generally add it up

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.869 
there and just generally add it up
better<00:06:45.469> than<00:06:45.529> most<00:06:45.860> but<00:06:46.129> again<00:06:46.430> I<00:06:46.459> don't<00:06:46.759> know

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:46.879 
better than most but again I don't know

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.939 
better than most but again I don't know
if<00:06:46.999> it's<00:06:47.149> worth<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.509> shot<00:06:47.800> importing<00:06:48.800> and

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
if it's worth a shot importing and
