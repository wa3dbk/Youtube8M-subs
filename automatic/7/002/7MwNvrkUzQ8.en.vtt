00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Marc everything we have here in front of us 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.230
 are the same flowers of orchids this 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.950
 are all orchids may arts 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.150
 who as soon as they are still 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.429
 different 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
 the orchids makes the family the most 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.299
 rich and varied in the plant world 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.210
 his twenty-two thousand species in the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.580
 world so we see well here the famous 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 fallen oak cissÃ© we can see that there is 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.830
 a single growth center from where 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 spell all the leaves words no 1 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.769
 global one foot in the case of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.630
 dendrobium so these are saints 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 poggiale so we can see here a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.170
 multitude of boot feet at the base 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 foot and a common peculiarity of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 all orchids is the perfect 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.910
 symmetry of the flower they are 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.379
 hiding what are called plants 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 epiphytes ie they will get 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.910
 pose at the intersection of the branches of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 tall trees in the forest and orchid 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 who want to transport either by 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.699
 birds be by other animals will get 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.620
 develop and she will push so her 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 completely alain roots when one is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 in an apartment a house 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.879
 does that mean they 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.379
 ask a lot of light when one is 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.519
 in this tropical forest we are under 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.140
 tree cover 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 so they're still up 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.880
 so when they are neither shadow with when 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.020
 even periods of light that go 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.340
 to pass between the foliage but that's 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 not at all full sun so it's 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 behind a bay window and we avoid 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 always the full sun on the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.930
 orchids at the level of the diggers that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.119
 it looks so much more so then 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 this rate that the wii because 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 naturally m6 family has roots 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.939
 much stronger 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 but we see how on this plant there 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.030
 we actually see roots that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.280
 are in the mix and roots that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.100
 are aerial what would be called who 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 are above the pot so its roots 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.729
 we must not want to put them back 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 in the earth you have to leave them to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.630
 outside because they have a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.479
 quite exceptional ability what she 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.369
 worth being able to capture moisture 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 and the nutrients of the air 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 the small fish compared to the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.140
 size of the plant then actually 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.280
 there is a report to the plan that is very 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 lower in the hour that it is this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.140
 that we do not speak of soil but of a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.750
 mixture that is completely inert we have 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.240
 mixed pine bark from the sfen 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.710
 of the perlite of vermiculite he did 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.750
 no nutritional value 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.780
 it simply serves as the foundation for the incident 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.480
 at the watering level benefits 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 how often according to the months of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 the year the season if we want to do 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.040
 simple you have to give back the same 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.150
 conditions that these orchids have in the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.090
 rainforest in the rainforest 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.920
 it's raining at once that is to say that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.560
 when watering an orchid at home 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.390
 you really have to bathe several 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.340
 we'll put it back in 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.630
 do it two to three times and cons 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.610
 after we can wait three weeks to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.810
 a month before their ticket the most 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.130
 dangerous is to want to wet a 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.120
 little bit every day at the end of 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.640
 account we wet a little every day 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 we water leave especially we bring a 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.780
 moisture that will evaporate I would say 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 in the day however we will empty the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 saucer because otherwise it will cause 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.959
 a rot it would be a humidity 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.800
 constant that she does not claim a 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.209
 another example that's how it's there 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.860
 there is no support at all 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.750
 roots or roots let them 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.110
 go to read perfectly in the open air 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.019
 and the plant will live all his daughter's 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.780
 that way hooked and we got it 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 will bathe to moisten the breeds 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.739
 risk putting it back into the hooked position 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
 different supports of the house and the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.610
 small site to break and the goal 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.320
 of course on the roots but as on 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.480
 a little while orchids always very 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.170
 very good to give a dampness especially 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.170
 on the aerial roots
