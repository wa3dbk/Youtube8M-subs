it cost a couple of cents and it just

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
it cost a couple of cents and it just

really improves the looks of it and it
is<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.220> 4<00:02:50.489> pin<00:02:50.670> pwm<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.709> gonna<00:02:52.890> ramp<00:02:53.099> up

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
is a 4 pin pwm so it is gonna ramp up

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160 
is a 4 pin pwm so it is gonna ramp up

now<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.069> actual<00:02:56.370> fan<00:02:56.730> blades<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.599> are

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
now the actual fan blades on this are

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.259 
now the actual fan blades on this are
very<00:02:58.500> aggressive<00:02:58.860> they<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> very

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
very aggressive they have a very

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.670 
very aggressive they have a very
aggressive<00:03:00.420> angle<00:03:01.170> which<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.319> how<00:03:01.560> they're

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
aggressive angle which is how they're

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.410 
aggressive angle which is how they're
able<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.250> massive<00:03:02.760> static<00:03:03.180> pressure

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
able to get that massive static pressure

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.920 
able to get that massive static pressure
on<00:03:03.659> there<00:03:04.159> but<00:03:05.159> again<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.540> could<00:03:06.750> also

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
on there but again this could also

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.009 
on there but again this could also
create<00:03:07.260> quite<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:08.040> bit<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.489> blade<00:03:08.879> noise<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
create quite a bit of blade noise at you

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.020 
create quite a bit of blade noise at you
know<00:03:10.170> higher<00:03:10.409> rpm<00:03:10.950> speeds<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.819> we'll<00:03:11.909> be

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
know higher rpm speeds so we'll be

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.610 
know higher rpm speeds so we'll be
checking<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.540> when<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.959> our<00:03:13.110> review<00:03:13.500> of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
checking that when we do our review of

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.979 
checking that when we do our review of
this<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.489> moves<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.909> ton<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.150> air<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.659> spinning

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
this it moves a ton of air just spinning

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.930 
this it moves a ton of air just spinning
it<00:03:16.080> by<00:03:16.200> hand<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.680> feel<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.129> much<00:03:17.250> air<00:03:17.489> coming<00:03:17.760> off

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
it by hand I feel so much air coming off

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.699 
it by hand I feel so much air coming off
the<00:03:18.060> back<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.480> fan<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.959> can't<00:03:19.319> wait<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.530> see

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the back of this fan I can't wait to see

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.890 
the back of this fan I can't wait to see
how<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.890> actually<00:03:20.159> sounds<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:21.629> let's<00:03:21.810> go

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
how it actually sounds now let's go

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.780 
how it actually sounds now let's go
ahead<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.170> talk<00:03:22.319> about<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.220> meat<00:03:23.550> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
ahead and talk about the the meat of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.880 
ahead and talk about the the meat of
this<00:03:23.940> review<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.599> that<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.560> actual

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
this review and that is the actual

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.030 
this review and that is the actual
cooling<00:03:26.370> tower<00:03:26.610> itself<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.420> here<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
cooling tower itself and here it is the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.000 
cooling tower itself and here it is the
entire<00:03:29.400> tower<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.890> kind<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.920> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
entire tower is a kind of a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.009 
entire tower is a kind of a
nickel-plated<00:03:32.370> tower<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.569> gonna<00:03:33.690> look

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
nickel-plated tower so it's gonna look

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.710 
nickel-plated tower so it's gonna look
really<00:03:34.379> good<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:35.129> got<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:36.390> ton<00:03:36.659> of

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
really good it's got a ton of

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.470 
really good it's got a ton of
actual<00:03:37.440> cooling<00:03:37.890> blades<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.360> has

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
actual cooling blades on here and it has

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.660 
actual cooling blades on here and it has
four<00:03:39.870> copper<00:03:40.470> heat<00:03:40.680> pipes<00:03:40.920> nickel<00:03:41.370> plated

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
four copper heat pipes nickel plated

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.820 
four copper heat pipes nickel plated
copper<00:03:41.790> heat<00:03:42.150> pipes<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:43.019> are<00:03:43.290> sanded<00:03:43.799> down

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
copper heat pipes that are sanded down

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.649 
copper heat pipes that are sanded down
and<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.640> see<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:44.940> actual<00:03:45.239> copper<00:03:45.569> is

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
and you can see the actual copper is

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.440 
and you can see the actual copper is
exposed<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.739> comes<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.159> the<00:03:47.459> block

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
exposed when it comes to the block

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.960 
exposed when it comes to the block
itself<00:03:49.110> or<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.470> actual<00:03:49.709> heatsink<00:03:50.310> contact

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
itself or the actual heatsink contact

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.539 
itself or the actual heatsink contact
point<00:03:51.269> with<00:03:51.360> your<00:03:51.599> heat<00:03:51.750> spreader<00:03:52.080> now<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.189> not

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
point with your heat spreader now so not

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.830 
point with your heat spreader now so not
a<00:03:53.580> whole<00:03:53.760> lot<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:53.909> talk<00:03:54.030> about<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.689> I<00:03:54.810> mean

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
a whole lot to talk about on this I mean

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.869 
a whole lot to talk about on this I mean
the<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.409> blades<00:03:55.650> feel<00:03:55.920> solid<00:03:56.370> they<00:03:56.519> do<00:03:56.580> have

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
the the blades feel solid they do have

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.390 
the the blades feel solid they do have
their<00:03:57.750> nice<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.019> straight<00:03:58.530> they're<00:03:58.739> not<00:03:58.890> bent

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
their nice and straight they're not bent

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.940 
their nice and straight they're not bent
they<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.450> attract<00:04:00.900> fingerprints<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.769> want

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
they do attract fingerprints so you want

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.100 
they do attract fingerprints so you want
to<00:04:02.010> keep<00:04:02.099> that<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.280> mind<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.299> see<00:04:03.930> right

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
to keep that in mind you can see right

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.990 
to keep that in mind you can see right
through<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.500> thing<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.370> let's<00:04:05.549> go<00:04:05.670> ahead<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
through the thing so let's go ahead and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.460 
through the thing so let's go ahead and
get<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.480> test<00:04:06.659> bench<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.080> let's

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
get this in the test bench and let's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.259 
get this in the test bench and let's
compare<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.099> see<00:04:08.340> how<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.640> does<00:04:08.819> on<00:04:08.849> my

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
compare and see how it does on my

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.839 
compare and see how it does on my

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
overclocked 46 70 K and we'll go ahead

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.880 
overclocked 46 70 K and we'll go ahead
and<00:04:11.939> talk<00:04:12.060> about<00:04:12.090> whether<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.629> not<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.860> a

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
and talk about whether or not this is a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.229 
and talk about whether or not this is a
bi<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:14.489> something<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:14.939> should<00:04:15.120> consider

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
bi and something you should consider

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.449 
bi and something you should consider
taking<00:04:15.659> a<00:04:15.840> look<00:04:15.989> at<00:04:16.169> from<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:16.829> brand<00:04:17.310> new

taking a look at from this brand new

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.090 
taking a look at from this brand new

company ragin tech

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.380 
company ragin tech
I<00:04:19.130> think<00:04:19.310> that's<00:04:19.490> how<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.610> say<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> I'm

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
I think that's how you say it I'm

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.250 
I think that's how you say it I'm
honestly<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:21.020> sure<00:04:22.600> hey<00:04:23.600> guys<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:23.960> before<00:04:24.230> I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
honestly not sure hey guys so before I

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.300 
honestly not sure hey guys so before I
could<00:04:24.470> even<00:04:24.590> start<00:04:24.860> talking<00:04:25.190> about

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
could even start talking about

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.800 
could even start talking about
temperatures<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.120> I'd<00:04:26.330> ran<00:04:26.570> into<00:04:26.780> a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
temperatures on this I'd ran into a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.390 
temperatures on this I'd ran into a
problem<00:04:27.050> that's<00:04:27.410> actually<00:04:27.830> really<00:04:28.100> common

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
problem that's actually really common

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.590 
problem that's actually really common
and<00:04:28.790> many<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:29.450> probably

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
and many of you have probably

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.020 
and many of you have probably
experienced<00:04:30.440> yourself<00:04:30.800> where<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> fan<00:04:31.760> was

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
experienced yourself where the fan was

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.030 
experienced yourself where the fan was
actually<00:04:32.480> hitting<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.780> RAM<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.530> my<00:04:33.800> test

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
actually hitting the RAM on my test

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.740 
actually hitting the RAM on my test
bench<00:04:34.280> now<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:34.970> isn't<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.270> big<00:04:35.420> deal<00:04:35.600> if<00:04:35.720> you

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
bench now this isn't a big deal if you

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.570 
bench now this isn't a big deal if you
have<00:04:35.810> standard<00:04:36.380> height<00:04:36.560> RAM<00:04:36.830> or<00:04:37.100> Ranma

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
have standard height RAM or Ranma

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.190 
have standard height RAM or Ranma
doesn't<00:04:37.820> have<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:37.940> tall<00:04:38.210> heatsink<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.080> or

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
doesn't have a tall heatsink on it or

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.710 
doesn't have a tall heatsink on it or
heat<00:04:39.350> spreader<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.860> my<00:04:40.040> 82<00:04:40.490> Ram<00:04:40.670> does<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.630> it

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
heat spreader like my 82 Ram does so it

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.630 
heat spreader like my 82 Ram does so it
may<00:04:41.810> not<00:04:41.840> even<00:04:42.050> be<00:04:42.230> an<00:04:42.290> issue<00:04:42.410> for<00:04:42.560> you<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:43.520> in

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
may not even be an issue for you so in

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.820 
may not even be an issue for you so in
my<00:04:43.790> case<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.390> fan<00:04:44.660> was<00:04:44.840> striking<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> rim<00:04:45.620> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
my case the fan was striking the rim and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.520 
my case the fan was striking the rim and
what<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.430> had<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.670> do<00:04:46.940> was<00:04:47.390> I<00:04:47.420> had<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.900> instead<00:04:48.380> of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
what I had to do was I had to instead of

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.170 
what I had to do was I had to instead of
doing<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.830> push<00:04:49.070> configuration<00:04:49.850> which<00:04:50.030> would

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
doing a push configuration which would

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.450 
doing a push configuration which would
be<00:04:50.300> desired<00:04:50.750> on<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.320> heatsink<00:04:51.740> tower<00:04:52.010> like<00:04:52.250> this

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
be desired on a heatsink tower like this

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.850 
be desired on a heatsink tower like this
I<00:04:52.700> had<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.210> go<00:04:53.300> into<00:04:53.420> a<00:04:53.570> pull<00:04:53.900> configuration<00:04:54.710> by

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
I had to go into a pull configuration by

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.620 
I had to go into a pull configuration by
putting<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.220> fan<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.730> opposite<00:04:56.120> side<00:04:56.360> I

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
putting the fan on the opposite side I

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.780 
putting the fan on the opposite side I
don't<00:04:56.960> feel<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.040> most<00:04:58.220> optimal

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
don't feel that that is the most optimal

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.270 
don't feel that that is the most optimal
fan<00:04:59.030> setting<00:04:59.450> for<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> heatsink<00:05:00.110> tower<00:05:00.980> like

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
fan setting for a heatsink tower like

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.400 
fan setting for a heatsink tower like
this<00:05:01.520> where<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.270> air-cooled<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.260> I<00:05:03.290> just

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
this where it's air-cooled so I just

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.750 
this where it's air-cooled so I just
want<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.800> be<00:05:03.890> mindful<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.400> that<00:05:04.580> while

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
want you to be mindful of that while

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.830 
want you to be mindful of that while
we're<00:05:04.910> talking<00:05:05.150> about<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.390> temperatures

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
we're talking about the temperatures

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.780 
we're talking about the temperatures
here<00:05:05.960> moving<00:05:06.290> forward<00:05:06.680> okay<00:05:06.860> first<00:05:07.580> things

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
here moving forward okay first things

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.610 
here moving forward okay first things
first<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.210> installation<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:08.900> really<00:05:09.080> simple

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
first the installation is really simple

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.470 
first the installation is really simple
the<00:05:09.740> backplate<00:05:10.220> fits<00:05:10.520> all<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.940> your<00:05:11.060> sockets

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
the backplate fits all of your sockets

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.970 
the backplate fits all of your sockets
you<00:05:11.540> have<00:05:11.690> one<00:05:11.900> backplate<00:05:12.380> for<00:05:12.560> everything

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
you have one backplate for everything

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.950 
you have one backplate for everything
the<00:05:13.460> fan<00:05:13.730> mounts<00:05:14.120> with<00:05:14.240> these<00:05:14.390> little<00:05:14.840> rubber

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
the fan mounts with these little rubber

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.810 
the fan mounts with these little rubber
tabs<00:05:15.560> that<00:05:15.740> just<00:05:16.010> kind<00:05:16.160> of<00:05:16.220> hook<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.730> the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
tabs that just kind of hook on to the

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.390 
tabs that just kind of hook on to the
heatsink<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.420> it's<00:05:17.540> really<00:05:17.870> simple<00:05:18.380> now<00:05:19.280> when

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
heatsink so it's really simple now when

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.620 
heatsink so it's really simple now when
it<00:05:19.490> comes<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.850> temperatures<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.480> don't

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
it comes to the temperatures I don't

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.270 
it comes to the temperatures I don't
really<00:05:20.750> think<00:05:20.840> there's<00:05:21.200> anything<00:05:21.410> surprising

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
really think there's anything surprising

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.130 
really think there's anything surprising
here<00:05:22.610> when<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.090> comes<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.390> stock<00:05:23.660> voltage

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
here when it comes to stock voltage

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.170 
here when it comes to stock voltage
stock<00:05:24.500> clocks<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.340> kept<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.730> CPU

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
stock clocks this thing kept the CPU

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.410 
stock clocks this thing kept the CPU

and<00:05:29.780> had<00:05:30.650> absolutely<00:05:31.010> no<00:05:31.250> problem

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
and had absolutely no problem

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.860 
and had absolutely no problem
maintaining<00:05:31.760> that<00:05:32.060> temperature<00:05:32.240> with<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.630> low

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
maintaining that temperature with a low

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
fan speed no issues at all but as soon

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.240 
fan speed no issues at all but as soon
as<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.750> started<00:05:36.050> bumping<00:05:36.380> more<00:05:36.530> voltage<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:37.130> it

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
as I started bumping more voltage to it

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.450 
as I started bumping more voltage to it
and<00:05:37.430> started<00:05:37.820> reaching<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.390> 1.27<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.950> 1.3

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
and started reaching that 1.27 to 1.3

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.910 
and started reaching that 1.27 to 1.3
volt<00:05:40.940> range<00:05:41.180> for<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.480> CPU<00:05:41.840> which<00:05:42.560> is<00:05:42.710> what's

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
volt range for the CPU which is what's

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.770 
volt range for the CPU which is what's
required<00:05:43.190> for<00:05:43.640> my<00:05:43.790> chip<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.240> get<00:05:44.390> it's<00:05:44.510> four

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
required for my chip to get it's four

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.770 
required for my chip to get it's four
point<00:05:45.050> four<00:05:45.500> gigahertz<00:05:46.160> overclock<00:05:46.730> I<00:05:47.000> started

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
point four gigahertz overclock I started

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.300 
point four gigahertz overclock I started
seeing<00:05:48.020> temperatures<00:05:48.530> go<00:05:48.740> all<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.100> way<00:05:49.130> up

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
seeing temperatures go all the way up

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.430 
seeing temperatures go all the way up
into<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.670> 90s<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.270> this<00:05:50.990> cooler<00:05:51.320> is

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
into the 90s so this cooler is

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.140 
into the 90s so this cooler is
definitely<00:05:51.980> not<00:05:52.160> up<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.640> task

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
definitely not up to the task

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.360 
definitely not up to the task
when<00:05:53.570> it<00:05:53.660> comes<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:54.110> cooling<00:05:54.650> down<00:05:54.980> that<00:05:55.220> much

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
when it comes to cooling down that much

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.100 
when it comes to cooling down that much
voltage<00:05:55.670> and<00:05:56.330> there<00:05:56.450> could<00:05:56.570> be<00:05:56.600> a<00:05:56.720> couple<00:05:56.900> of

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
voltage and there could be a couple of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.840 
voltage and there could be a couple of
reasons<00:05:57.290> for<00:05:57.590> this<00:05:57.710> one<00:05:57.980> it<00:05:58.220> could<00:05:58.490> be<00:05:58.640> because

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
reasons for this one it could be because

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.350 
reasons for this one it could be because
the<00:05:59.750> actual<00:06:00.230> block<00:06:00.560> is<00:06:00.830> not<00:06:01.250> very<00:06:01.610> smooth<00:06:02.090> it's

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the actual block is not very smooth it's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.770 
the actual block is not very smooth it's
kind<00:06:02.720> of<00:06:02.780> rough<00:06:03.280> it's<00:06:04.280> just<00:06:04.520> usually<00:06:05.270> better

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
kind of rough it's just usually better

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.570 
kind of rough it's just usually better
temperatures<00:06:06.380> come<00:06:06.590> from<00:06:06.770> a<00:06:06.860> lapped<00:06:07.100> service

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
temperatures come from a lapped service

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.450 
temperatures come from a lapped service
which<00:06:07.730> is<00:06:07.880> polished<00:06:08.480> and<00:06:08.720> glassy<00:06:09.350> smooth<00:06:09.890> so

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
which is polished and glassy smooth so

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.950 
which is polished and glassy smooth so
that<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:10.700> don't<00:06:10.880> get<00:06:11.030> any<00:06:11.210> crevices<00:06:11.750> and

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
that you don't get any crevices and

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.660 
that you don't get any crevices and
things<00:06:12.140> for<00:06:12.320> there<00:06:12.410> to<00:06:12.560> be<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:13.160> know<00:06:13.280> micro

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
things for there to be you know micro

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.460 
things for there to be you know micro
gaps<00:06:13.940> which<00:06:14.180> really<00:06:14.540> do<00:06:14.750> affect<00:06:15.110> temperatures

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
gaps which really do affect temperatures

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.260 
gaps which really do affect temperatures
it<00:06:15.950> also<00:06:16.310> good<00:06:16.460> just<00:06:16.640> because<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.090> fact

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
it also good just because of the fact

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.820 
it also good just because of the fact
that<00:06:17.510> there's<00:06:17.660> only<00:06:17.780> four<00:06:18.140> heat<00:06:18.350> pipes<00:06:18.590> in

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
that there's only four heat pipes in

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.740 
that there's only four heat pipes in

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
this particular cooler now this cooler

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.140 
this particular cooler now this cooler
is<00:06:21.050> going<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.410> be<00:06:21.590> very<00:06:22.190> similar<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.820> like<00:06:23.000> the

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
is going to be very similar to like the

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.030 
is going to be very similar to like the
cooler<00:06:23.360> master<00:06:23.540> hyper<00:06:23.720> 212<00:06:24.200> so<00:06:24.950> the

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
cooler master hyper 212 so the

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.710 
cooler master hyper 212 so the
performance<00:06:25.520> here<00:06:25.730> is<00:06:25.910> pretty<00:06:26.300> much<00:06:26.480> on<00:06:26.690> par

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
performance here is pretty much on par

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.360 
performance here is pretty much on par
with<00:06:26.990> what<00:06:27.200> I've<00:06:27.440> experienced<00:06:28.040> with<00:06:28.130> that

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
with what I've experienced with that

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.070 
with what I've experienced with that
cooler<00:06:28.640> in<00:06:28.880> various<00:06:29.210> builds<00:06:29.570> that<00:06:29.750> I've<00:06:29.900> done

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
cooler in various builds that I've done

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.750 
cooler in various builds that I've done
now<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.650> don't<00:06:30.740> talk<00:06:30.950> about<00:06:31.070> costs<00:06:31.520> because<00:06:31.669> I

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
now I don't talk about costs because I

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.320 
now I don't talk about costs because I
have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
have

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.809 
have
no<00:06:32.629> idea<00:06:32.900> how<00:06:33.139> much<00:06:33.289> this<00:06:33.530> thing<00:06:33.770> costs<00:06:34.340> so<00:06:34.789> I

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
no idea how much this thing costs so I

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.670 
no idea how much this thing costs so I
can't<00:06:35.090> really<00:06:35.270> talk<00:06:35.419> about<00:06:35.479> that<00:06:35.750> but<00:06:36.379> tell<00:06:36.650> me

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
can't really talk about that but tell me

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.469 
can't really talk about that but tell me
