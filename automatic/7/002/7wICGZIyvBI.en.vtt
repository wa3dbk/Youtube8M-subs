00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
but I just got so frustrated navigating

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.050

what was going on what was cool was

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.940 
what was going on what was cool was
being<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.110> when<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.379> were<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.619> sub-zero

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
being that and when you were in sub-zero

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.859 
being that and when you were in sub-zero
temperatures<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:09.939> had<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.209> stay<00:02:10.420> warm<00:02:10.629> by

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
temperatures you had to stay warm by

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.660 
temperatures you had to stay warm by
heating<00:02:11.079> up<00:02:11.260> yourself<00:02:11.620> near<00:02:11.770> lights<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:12.520> time

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
heating up yourself near lights but time

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
heating up yourself near lights but time
after<00:02:12.819> time<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:13.360> gets<00:02:13.690> really<00:02:13.870> old<00:02:14.040> now<00:02:15.040> I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
after time it just gets really old now I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
after time it just gets really old now I
know<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.790> not<00:02:16.000> an<00:02:16.209> action

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
know it's not an action

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.780 
know it's not an action
person<00:02:17.349> shooter<00:02:17.680> but<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.130> feel<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.550> more

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
person shooter but I just feel with more

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
person shooter but I just feel with more
action<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.599> could<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.930> played<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.200> well

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
action it could have played that well

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
action it could have played that well
similar<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.160> fear<00:02:21.370> series<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:22.330> is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
similar to the fear series there is

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.089 
similar to the fear series there is
great<00:02:22.510> tension<00:02:23.080> added<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> game<00:02:23.950> with

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
great tension added to the game with

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.740 
great tension added to the game with
fighting<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.610> AI<00:02:24.760> progressing<00:02:25.510> through

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
fighting the AI progressing through

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.870 
fighting the AI progressing through
after<00:02:26.020> all<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.800> time<00:02:27.190> slips<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.640> all<00:02:27.700> that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
after all the time slips and all that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.360 
after all the time slips and all that
but<00:02:28.330> it's<00:02:29.080> really<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.530> an<00:02:29.709> adventure<00:02:30.160> and
