00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.049
 magazines in the gifts that brings in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.049
 the magazines of the month 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.910
 February 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.380
 and well I start to tell you 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 I only bought one in this 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.820
 occasion is the glamor 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.810
 here you have it because it brings all these 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 cosmetic products 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.650
 not all in the same magazine but in 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.710
 Each magazine brings a random one that can 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.739
 but for the mascara on 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.590
 blush this mosaic as the lipsticks 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.900
 Everything looks great but 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.440
 then 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.810
 here you see it we find 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.940
 certain surprises because because 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.360
 good in well enclosed labials not 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.460
 you see the tone that is the same as the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.590
 Rouge is worth the rouge comes like this 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.170
 So you can not see the tone that you 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.270
 you are going to take I wanted this one here 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.180
 good is also the palette that either 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.550
 I know if all the palettes will be the same I 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.040
 I wanted this blusher and good when 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.200
 I took out of its container is a pack with the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.710
 magazine I found that what came to me 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.710
 to this 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.680
 so good the truth is that it is very 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.680
 ok well here your little mirror comes with your 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.700
 go 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.329
 Cache wine from these that is not sponge 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 It is worth to be the chamois suede and 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.549
 the illuminator is this I show you this way 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.429
 because it comes with its protective plastic 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.899
 it's untouched I do not want to touch it because 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.549
 I'm not going to use it and I'm going to put it to 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.940
 the sale in my store by itself some 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.040
 three interested 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.580
 me of this kind of illuminators this 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.140
 illuminator wants to imitate a little the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.690
 Girl illuminator in the famous pearls 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.670
 illuminators of girl in the meteorites 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.799
 OK 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.689
 in tone 01 because you already know that 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.660
 they also have several shades is 0 1 is 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.240
 as well as this are several cold tones 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.670
 for light skin are indicated for 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.700
 fair skins and good is supposed to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.220
 what they do is that when you take it all together 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.320
 with the brush 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.930
 well, it distributes all over the skin 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.250
 the colors they bring integrated in the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.620
 will return in this case and the reflection of the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.020
 light with these colors in particular makes 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.750
 that dark areas are concealed 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.810
 counteract the spots and well then 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.459
 you know no 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.470
 that's what's advertised 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.739
 meteorites of berlin then good yo 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.620
 I think this kind of illuminator is what 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.860
 what you want to do a little is imitate is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.770
 take aim not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.500
 here you see them again 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.630
 Carlos has also press 2 in this 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.070
 format but good to me I like more the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.970
 meteorites but that's another story that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.310
 must be told on another occasion 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.690
 and the fact is that I 'm not going to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.200
 use because I have other 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.930
 similar to erc the quartet of which 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.580
 it also comes with these tones and now 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.470
 having the meteorites good then no longer 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.060
 he liked it either so this thing that is 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.380
 without touching I'll put it in the little shop 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.210
 for sale for the price that has 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.220
 cost the magazine is worth three 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.200
 euros bear in mind that the expenses of 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.300
 shipping are included then good if 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.370
 you are interested to know that what 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.230
 you're going to have in the little store or already 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.650
 you would have had in the little store if you did not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.110
 has sold since as can be 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.689
 then glamor is what I said 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.970
 my idea was to take this magazine because 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.180
 I wanted this rouge like it has not come 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.010
 the blusher because I can stand it and it's 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.409
 the lipsticks look pretty good 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.750
 rather and now I'm going to show you what 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.400
 it is the magazine itself 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.750
 good that it is so the small format 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.150
 that you already know that I like more 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.670
 as well 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.670
 does not bring any more samples of josep to 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.940
 this is the bad cover 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.370
 and so you know you have all those 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.290
 cosmetic products to choose from 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.850
 each magazine depending on the province 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.310
 because not all it also fails 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.049
 same so if you want to keep an eye on 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.210
 your kiosk to see what has already brought 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.760
 see if you are lucky and you touch something that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.160
 you like it although you can use 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.460
 the next magazine that I show you is the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.630
 woman magazine that brings a conditioner 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.340
 for hydrotec 9 hair from cyber land 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.460
 conditioner without rinsing and a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.850
 chocolate bar lindt I leave you with 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.850
 the photo 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.449
 the magazine that on the cover was 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.800
 Penelope Cross 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:02.759
 the 2014 lookbook brings us a supplement 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.439
 the new Pocket Pocket style and a 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.439
 elisabeth arden discount card 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.620
 the telva journal what it brings is a 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.620
 beauty supplement 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.060
 the cosmopolitan magazine brings depending 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.060
 also from the area 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.640
 of what has reached each locality 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.220
 You can choose between a product of 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.190
 beauty of ory flame or a bicrim the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.900
 bilingual web king or something like that was called 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.840
 they also put it on another occasion 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.790
 I have it and in my locality what 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.930
 there was precisely this bicrim well 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.930
 which of course I had not caught 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.800
 the vogue magazine that this time not 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.800
 bring neither gift nor supplement 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.400
 Marie Claire, who brings us an enamel from 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.340
 Fashion studio nails up to 9 colors 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.870
 to choose also depends on what 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.870
 that reaches each locality 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:38.019
 and finally instyle magazine that what 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.019
 what it brings is a bag like a canvas bag 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.340
 I have seen it and it has not called me 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.490
 especially the attention is not of 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.490
 Canvas is like as of this material so 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.740
 As a plasticizer I would not know how to tell you 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.870
 a bag like that, staying with handles very 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.580
 simple we left the photo better to see if 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.580
 you can see it a little clearer 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.300
 and good in principle, nothing more 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.310
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.770
 arrive on time so you can catch the 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.270
 magazine that is interested and see you in 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.270
 the next until then
