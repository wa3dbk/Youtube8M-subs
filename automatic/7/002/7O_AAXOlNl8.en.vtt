bought used this one's a 3500 the only

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.040 
bought used this one's a 3500 the only
difference<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> 3500<00:00:21.029> they<00:00:21.660> come<00:00:21.869> with

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
difference in the 3500 they come with

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.769 
difference in the 3500 they come with
the<00:00:22.199> overload<00:00:23.010> springs<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.210> use

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the overload springs I don't really use

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
the overload springs I don't really use
them<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.140> I've<00:00:26.099> pulled<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.519> little<00:00:26.699> bit

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
them that much I've pulled a little bit

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.460 
them that much I've pulled a little bit
with<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.369> I<00:00:29.369> really<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:31.260> it's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
with this thing and I really think it's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.850 
with this thing and I really think it's
great<00:00:31.759> again<00:00:32.759> 50,000<00:00:33.450> miles<00:00:33.600> they're<00:00:34.020> pretty

to run them through the winter and just

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
to run them through the winter and just
deal<00:00:46.350> anyways<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.450> 2013<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> GMS<00:00:50.239> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
deal anyways in the 2013 on the GMS with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.240 
deal anyways in the 2013 on the GMS with
the<00:00:51.329> Duramax<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.649> an

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the Duramax they actually put an

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.869 
the Duramax they actually put an
injector<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.270> front<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.860> DPF<00:00:58.879> converter

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
injector in front of the DPF converter

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
injector in front of the DPF converter
whatever<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> call<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.109> versus

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
whatever you want to call it versus

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.119 
whatever you want to call it versus
putting<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:03.229> near<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> manifold<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:04.979> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
putting it up near the manifold and what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.270 
putting it up near the manifold and what
that<00:01:05.339> helps<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> helps<00:01:06.450> burn<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.710> soot

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that helps do is it helps burn the soot

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000 
that helps do is it helps burn the soot
that's<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.530> away<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> engine

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's in there away from the engine

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
that's in there away from the engine
because<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.580> had<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.270> near<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
because when they had them up near the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
because when they had them up near the
engine<00:01:13.860> fuel<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> oil<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
engine fuel was going in the oil and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
engine fuel was going in the oil and
obviously<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.280> good<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> causing

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
obviously that's not good and causing

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.960 
obviously that's not good and causing
some<00:01:18.240> problems<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.900> believe<00:01:19.310> 2013<00:01:20.310> Jim<00:01:20.820> was

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
some problems and I believe 2013 Jim was

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990 
some problems and I believe 2013 Jim was
the<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.229> Dodge<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.009> Ford

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

like I said I've been averaging with

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.400 
like I said I've been averaging with
this<00:02:45.890> truck<00:02:46.300> in<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.510> particular<00:02:47.840> case<00:02:48.230> I

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
this truck in this particular case I

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
this truck in this particular case I
reset<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.010> odometer<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.540> average<00:02:50.720> fuel

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
reset the odometer the the average fuel

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.830 
reset the odometer the the average fuel
economy<00:02:51.680> measurement<00:02:52.610> part<00:02:53.240> on<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.420> computer

economy measurement part on the computer

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.040 
economy measurement part on the computer
there<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.140> reset<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.160> about<00:02:55.520> 250<00:02:56.480> miles<00:02:56.690> ago

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
there I reset that about 250 miles ago

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.440 
there I reset that about 250 miles ago
I'm<00:02:57.170> heading<00:02:57.550> actually<00:02:58.550> heading<00:02:58.790> from<00:02:58.940> came

to<00:03:01.160> home<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.230> reset<00:03:03.740> that<00:03:03.950> about<00:03:04.450> 250<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.630> so

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
to home and I reset that about 250 or so

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.080 
to home and I reset that about 250 or so
miles<00:03:06.110> ago<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.470> guess<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.070> about<00:03:07.190> 10

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
miles ago I guess it was about 10

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.360

o'clock as you can see there so that is

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.340
