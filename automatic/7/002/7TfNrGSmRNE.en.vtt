three-point oh this is the driver CD and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.510 
three-point oh this is the driver CD and
everything<00:02:04.840> also<00:02:05.770> condense<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.310> setpoint

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
everything also condense the setpoint

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.669 
everything also condense the setpoint
drivers<00:02:07.210> make<00:02:07.900> sure<00:02:08.049> you<00:02:08.140> install<00:02:08.530> these

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
drivers make sure you install these

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.199 
drivers make sure you install these
things<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.130> get<00:02:09.250> better<00:02:09.489> performance<00:02:09.700> out<00:02:10.149> of

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
things you get better performance out of

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.699 
things you get better performance out of
the<00:02:10.329> mouse<00:02:10.479> when<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.840> actually<00:02:11.049> use<00:02:11.470> them

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
otherwise it's pretty much plug-and-play

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
but you want to install this anyways get

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.229 
but you want to install this anyways get
a<00:02:15.760> picture<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.209> right<00:02:16.269> there<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:19.000> this

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239

the bag we have a little plug here now
what<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:30.940> does<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.329> not<00:02:31.480> only<00:02:31.600> charge<00:02:31.930> your

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the mouse why it's charging you can

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.479 
the mouse why it's charging you can
still<00:02:35.019> use<00:02:35.049> this<00:02:35.560> while<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.070> plugged<00:02:36.250> in

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489
