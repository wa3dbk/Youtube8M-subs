cartoony<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> same<00:02:21.989> time<00:02:22.230> funny<00:02:22.980> at

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
cartoony but at the same time funny at

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.800 
cartoony but at the same time funny at
the<00:02:23.220> same<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.879> thought<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.300> scene<00:02:24.510> where

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the same time I thought the scene where

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.800 
the same time I thought the scene where
they<00:02:25.739> all<00:02:26.010> emerge<00:02:26.489> from<00:02:26.849> different<00:02:27.180> bins<00:02:27.450> was

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
they all emerge from different bins was

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440

believe that ariana grande could fit one

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
believe that ariana grande could fit one
of<00:02:32.250> them<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.640> she's<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:32.970> petite<00:02:33.150> uh

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
thought was gonna happen I thought that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.960 
thought was gonna happen I thought that
ariana<00:02:40.739> grande<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.250> gonna<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:41.849> that

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
ariana grande was gonna be the one that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.309 
ariana grande was gonna be the one that
they<00:02:42.090> were<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.569> send<00:02:42.780> underneath<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
they were going to send underneath the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
laser and her character being so

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.789 
laser and her character being so
airheaded<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.840> thought<00:02:46.019> she<00:02:46.200> would<00:02:46.319> never<00:02:46.380> get

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
airheaded I thought she would never get

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.280 
airheaded I thought she would never get
to<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.579> control<00:02:47.970> panel<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.780> way<00:02:49.140> they

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
to the control panel but the way they

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
to the control panel but the way they
did<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.650> Matt<00:02:49.829> Bennett<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.790> as

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
did it with Matt Bennett was just as

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.110 
did it with Matt Bennett was just as
good<00:02:51.410> now<00:02:53.150> what<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> will<00:02:54.480> say<00:02:54.870> about<00:02:56.120> this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
good now what I will say about this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.089 
good now what I will say about this
episode<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.200> did<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:58.560> problem

episode is that it did have one problem
that<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.459> think<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.970> lot<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.349> Victoria's

that I think that a lot of Victoria's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.720 
that I think that a lot of Victoria's
episodes<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.160> that's<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> fact<00:03:02.579> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
episodes have and that's the fact that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.759 
episodes have and that's the fact that
the<00:03:03.269> show's<00:03:03.510> over<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.410> you're<00:03:04.530> getting

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
into it and part of that you can't blame

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
into it and part of that you can't blame
the<00:03:06.930> people<00:03:07.019> who<00:03:07.230> make<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.530> shows<00:03:07.709> for<00:03:08.040> that

you're really into it then all of a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.440 
you're really into it then all of a
sudden<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.340> oh<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.730> show's<00:03:23.880> over<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.389> the

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.309 
thought when we first came in and one of
them<00:06:21.360> at<00:06:21.419> fleshlight<00:06:21.839> I<00:06:21.900> honestly<00:06:22.169> thought

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
them at fleshlight I honestly thought

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.709 
them at fleshlight I honestly thought
they<00:06:22.439> were<00:06:22.500> security<00:06:23.039> guards<00:06:23.400> but<00:06:24.300> then<00:06:24.479> the

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
they were security guards but then the

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.240 
they were security guards but then the
way<00:06:24.810> they<00:06:24.930> were<00:06:24.990> talking<00:06:25.439> I<00:06:25.529> realized<00:06:25.949> oh<00:06:26.159> wait

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
way they were talking I realized oh wait

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.649 
way they were talking I realized oh wait
they're<00:06:26.430> not<00:06:26.460> in<00:06:26.610> uniform<00:06:26.729> there<00:06:27.240> and<00:06:27.389> kind<00:06:27.599> of

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
they're not in uniform there and kind of

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.510 
they're not in uniform there and kind of
dark<00:06:27.839> clothes<00:06:28.080> they<00:06:28.289> must<00:06:28.770> be<00:06:28.860> robbers<00:06:29.219> after

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
dark clothes they must be robbers after

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.579 
dark clothes they must be robbers after
all<00:06:29.669> but<00:06:30.180> I<00:06:30.210> thought<00:06:30.479> their<00:06:30.779> scene<00:06:30.990> with<00:06:31.289> Matt

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
all but I thought their scene with Matt

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.100 
all but I thought their scene with Matt
Bennett<00:06:31.830> was<00:06:32.039> very<00:06:32.250> funny<00:06:32.490> now<00:06:32.729> again<00:06:33.689> a<00:06:33.870> scene

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
Bennett was very funny now again a scene

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.899 
Bennett was very funny now again a scene
that<00:06:34.139> would<00:06:34.349> realistically<00:06:34.770> not<00:06:35.159> happen<00:06:35.669> but

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
that would realistically not happen but

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.990 
that would realistically not happen but
it's<00:06:36.569> a<00:06:36.690> Dan<00:06:36.899> Schneider<00:06:37.050> show<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:37.889> that's<00:06:38.789> the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
it's a Dan Schneider show and that's the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.330 
it's a Dan Schneider show and that's the
kind<00:06:39.180> of<00:06:39.240> humor<00:06:39.569> that<00:06:40.020> he<00:06:40.139> does

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
kind of humor that he does

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.190 
kind of humor that he does
but<00:06:41.640> anyway<00:06:41.910> so<00:06:41.940> that's<00:06:42.360> my<00:06:42.540> honest<00:06:42.840> opinion

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
but anyway so that's my honest opinion

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.840 
but anyway so that's my honest opinion
about<00:06:43.410> the<00:06:43.620> victorious<00:06:44.070> episode<00:06:44.460> entitled
