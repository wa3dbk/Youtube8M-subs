00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
kanji and nada and I think

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.330 
kanji and nada and I think
that<00:02:11.330> was<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> very<00:02:12.170> very<00:02:12.440> good<00:02:12.650> result<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.100> me

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.390 
that was a very very good result for me

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
but sometimes I lose against players who

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.480 
but sometimes I lose against players who
are<00:02:16.550> worse<00:02:17.300> than<00:02:17.330> me<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.890> I'm<00:02:19.040> pretty
