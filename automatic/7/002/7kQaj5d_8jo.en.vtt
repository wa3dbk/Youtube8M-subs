get ready to put the cloth on our crane
and<00:00:06.150> get<00:00:06.420> assuming<00:00:07.290> that's<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> be

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
and get assuming that's going to be

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.220 
and get assuming that's going to be
going<00:00:07.799> something<00:00:08.130> like<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.580> here<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
going something like this here and

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.110 
going something like this here and
there's<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.290> pulley<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:11.000> where's<00:00:12.000> your

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
there's a pulley here where's your

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.350 
there's a pulley here where's your
pulley<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.670> string<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.210> we're

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
pulley in here and the string that we're

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.820 
pulley in here and the string that we're
going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> pull<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> bit<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> go

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
going to pull out a bit is going to go

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
going to pull out a bit is going to go
wrapped<00:00:17.130> around<00:00:17.310> here<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.970> through<00:00:18.210> these

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
wrapped around here up through these

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.529 
wrapped around here up through these
pulleys<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:19.220> over<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> around<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
pulleys here over and around here and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
pulleys here over and around here and
back<00:00:21.720> around<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> that's<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> bring<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
back around and that's going to bring it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.880 
back around and that's going to bring it
up<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.570> down<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.650> claw

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
up and down up and down now the claw

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
up and down up and down now the claw
itself<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.880> controlled<00:00:27.240> by<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
itself is going to be controlled by a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.189 
itself is going to be controlled by a
servo<00:00:28.140> servo<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.640> okay<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.510> we're

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
servo servo is right here okay and we're

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.999 
servo servo is right here okay and we're
going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> we're<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:31.980> ahead

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.270 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:32.219> plug<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:34.010> servo<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.340> now

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
and plug in this servo right now

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
and plug in this servo right now
remember<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.430> wired<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> CM<00:00:39.360> 108<00:00:40.079> cable

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
remember we wired up to the CM 108 cable

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
remember we wired up to the CM 108 cable
that<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.340> left<00:00:41.550> dangling<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that was just left dangling well this is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
that was just left dangling well this is
what<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.390> leave

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
what it was for and we're going to leave

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.770 
what it was for and we're going to leave
it<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.559> connected<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
it like so so that's connected now and

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
it like so so that's connected now and
now<00:00:51.780> we're<00:00:51.960> ready<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.410> start<00:00:52.590> stringing<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> up

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now we're ready to start stringing it up

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.319 
now we're ready to start stringing it up
so<00:00:54.149> let's<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> our<00:00:55.530> kit<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.969> wanna

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so let's go back to our kit and wanna

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
so let's go back to our kit and wanna
pull<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> strings<00:01:02.780> okay<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.110> here's<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
pull out the strings okay so here's the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:25.789 
pull out the strings okay so here's the
string

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.899 

okay<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.609 

I'm<00:01:31.479> not<00:01:31.659> sure<00:01:31.869> we're<00:01:32.079> have<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.320> tie<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
I'm not sure we're have to tie the

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.289 
I'm not sure we're have to tie the
string<00:01:33.249> or<00:01:33.429> what<00:01:33.579> we're<00:01:33.700> going<00:01:33.789> to<00:01:33.880> have<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.090> do

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
string or what we're going to have to do

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.520 
string or what we're going to have to do
here

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.010 

I<00:01:39.619> do<00:01:40.580> know<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.390> going<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.600> have<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.869> go

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I do know this is going to have to go

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.840 
I do know this is going to have to go
through<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.880> here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:22.870 

somehow

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.940 

I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.680 

there's<00:02:29.580> no<00:02:29.670> real<00:02:29.819> instructions<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.540> how<00:02:30.569> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
there's no real instructions on how to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
there's no real instructions on how to
do<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.290> I'm<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.760> do<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
do this so I'm just going to do a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:43.809 
do this so I'm just going to do a
makeshift<00:02:33.300> tie<00:02:33.660> over<00:02:33.959> here

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.290 

ok

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
ok

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.390 
ok
for<00:02:46.900> now

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
for now

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.460 
for now
and<00:02:48.849> then<00:02:49.120> let's<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.510> how<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.079> actually

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
and then let's see how this is actually

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:19.540 
and then let's see how this is actually
going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> work

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:46.400 

so<00:03:20.120> we've<00:03:20.300> got<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.540> there

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.390 

looks<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.740> gonna<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.160> loop<00:03:48.370> back

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
looks like this gonna have to loop back

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:01.450 
looks like this gonna have to loop back
somehow

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.490 

right

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:05:50.399 

good<00:04:12.470> I'm<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.650> quickly<00:04:14.190> testing<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:14.970> year

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.439 

ah
