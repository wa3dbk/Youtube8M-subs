is<00:00:10.620> falling<00:00:11.160> off<00:00:11.309> because<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.509> just

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
is falling off because I just

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.259 
is falling off because I just
transformed<00:00:13.200> them<00:00:13.290> right<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.059> paint<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
transformed them right here and paint is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.550 
transformed them right here and paint is
chipping<00:00:15.719> away<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:17.630> really<00:00:18.630> know<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
chipping away like really know what a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.840 
chipping away like really know what a
comparison<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.070> should<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> chipping

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
comparison I should do about is chipping

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.189 
comparison I should do about is chipping
away<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.210> easily<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:23.090> he<00:00:24.090> looks<00:00:24.300> very<00:00:24.630> nice

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I think originally came from a custom

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.939 
I think originally came from a custom
son<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.570> custom<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.170> strong<00:00:31.410> animated

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
right so yeah he originally came from a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.059 
right so yeah he originally came from a
Sun<00:02:40.640> storm<00:02:40.910> mode<00:02:41.120> ain't<00:02:41.450> mold<00:02:41.870> bird<00:02:42.799> toy

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
Sun storm mode ain't mold bird toy

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.070 
Sun storm mode ain't mold bird toy
because<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.880> was<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.090> five<00:02:44.360> bucks<00:02:44.510> at<00:02:44.750> target

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:04.390 

and<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:57.250> very<00:02:58.250> nice<00:02:58.549> custom<00:02:59.180> done<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
and this is a very nice custom done and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.880 
and this is a very nice custom done and
