 characters from Monica's class 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.820
 they grew up and became teenagers and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.760

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 of adolescence 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.199
 even those who did not pass beyond childhood 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.570
 chip knows famous details of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 personality of each one of them 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 the greedy girl no one wants me like 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 outgoing 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.219
 the boy who has trouble speaking in 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.910
 exchange is an act is not she 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.059
 sick clothes 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.579
 the four are children for decades 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.670
 together in comic book adventures in the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.830
 the theater but as happened with 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 readers have come the time and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 characters have grown monica cascÃ£o 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 chives and magali is now 16 years old 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 subjects typical of adolescence to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 intention is to attract those who have already released comics 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 subjects are being sought 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 an interaction with the young 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.170
 even the internet and orkut pueira 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.009
 through permanent contacts with 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.240
 schools 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.479
 So we'll talk to the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.770
 young people to learn from them 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 we interact with him, we 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.130
 angels 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.770
 Mauricio de Sousa says that the idea came 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.979
 been worked for years and avenged for 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 kill curiosity him and the readers 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.909
 everybody second burton is that you 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.119
 take on the cross song and I have 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.360
 the difference is a denser edition each 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.850
 episode has almost 130 pages 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 another change was in the style of the drawings 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 that were similar to the stories 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 in Japanese comics 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.820
 hence the black and white print 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 traditionally called the manga 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.850
 the characters also changed 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 monica is no longer short and plump 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.580
 the chives that you now prefer to be 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.110
 called onion did treatment and did not 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.080
 change the letters 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.810
 magali cares about diet and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.370
 Now I'm going to take a shower and take a shower. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.990
 attention of the young also the super 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 interesting, I quite liked it 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.250
 I think it's cool so the public can 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.660
 to monitor their growth, right? 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.300
 Grow up, it's good to see them 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.640
 I also did not think it was very cool. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.709
 not to speak the truth he did 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.720
 little ones lost the charm because 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.970
 they were so cute little ones 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.340
 was different 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.260
 Filipe the proof partly speaks to the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.190
 authority of those who have learned to read 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.600
 four years with monica comics is 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.450
 comic book fan 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.430
 those of the maurice de souza of who keeps 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.200
 an autograph on the shirt 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.200
 two years ago he attended a meeting 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.739
 of fans with the cartoonist turned meeting 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.910
 an episode and filipe during appears in the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.530
 comic book cover and also full body 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.600
 with the onion I 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.760
 I recommend a friend when it's time to go 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.959
 although when history ends because 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.530
 fans arrive an hour they go away 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.660
 of the park and I claim it's over now 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.269
 says he liked the new magazine with 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.049
 crowded class but with reservations 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.500
 he looks naive it has attracted a 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:40.519
 of the public and displeased a 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.430
 another part as the proposal is to be manga 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.380
 then or at least based on manga and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.250
 anime manga is traditionally black and 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.280
 White 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 I liked it but what are details 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.989
 the passion of this voter and if it comes 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.660
 old monica 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.950
 if the grandchildren of monica come while the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.340
 stories were good 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.340
 I'm going to read
