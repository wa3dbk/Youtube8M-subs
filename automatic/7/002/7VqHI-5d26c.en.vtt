00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.510 
Lee but it's not I have about 20 15 FPS
and<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> pretty

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
and it's pretty

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.260 
and it's pretty
bat

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.830 

like<00:00:34.870> he<00:00:35.140> booked<00:00:35.320> now<00:00:35.470> had<00:00:35.710> luck<00:00:35.950> I<00:00:36.220> don't<00:00:36.490> know

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
2728 i'm using our texture packs which

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.730 
2728 i'm using our texture packs which
is<00:00:46.390> flow<00:00:46.780> HD<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.380> looks<00:00:47.680> amazing

and this is our set about it by the way
we<00:00:54.440> just<00:00:54.680> play<00:00:54.920> for<00:00:54.980> fun<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.700> not<00:00:55.940> like<00:00:56.180> we

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
we just play for fun it's not like we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.580 
we just play for fun it's not like we
are<00:00:56.510> doing<00:00:56.720> anything<00:00:57.140> special<00:00:57.430> just<00:00:58.430> for<00:00:59.000> fun

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.680 
are doing anything special just for fun
seeing<00:01:01.340> some<00:01:01.670> stuff<00:01:01.940> on<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.150> internet<00:01:02.270> and

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
seeing some stuff on the internet and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.400 
seeing some stuff on the internet and
try<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.230> like<00:01:03.560> this<00:01:04.129> house<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.699> example<00:01:05.180> I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
try to be like this house for example I

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.650 
try to be like this house for example I
saw<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.740> some<00:01:07.400> youtube<00:01:07.790> channel<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.390> I

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
saw it on some youtube channel and I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.950 
saw it on some youtube channel and I
liked<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.530> be<00:01:09.710> lit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 

and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.560 
and
let<00:01:15.090> me<00:01:15.300> just<00:01:15.540> tell<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.870> off

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
let me just tell you off

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.310 
let me just tell you off
thought<00:01:18.260> that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
thought that

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.030 
thought that
minecraft<00:01:21.320> doesn't<00:01:21.710> spend<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:22.250> much<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.490> CPU

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
minecraft doesn't spend so much of CPU

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.260 
minecraft doesn't spend so much of CPU
but<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> cool

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
but this is a cool

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.499 
but this is a cool
good<00:01:26.570> example<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.649> actually<00:01:28.399> it<00:01:28.520> does<00:01:28.820> in

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
good example that actually it does in

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.050 
good example that actually it does in
this<00:01:29.659> processor<00:01:30.380> does<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.250> handle<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.850> it's

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
this processor does it handle that it's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.130 
this processor does it handle that it's
not<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.270> graphic<00:01:32.750> card

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
not a graphic card

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
not a graphic card
I<00:01:34.200> play<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> graphic<00:01:35.490> cut<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> another

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I play with that graphic cut on another

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.360 
I play with that graphic cut on another
computer<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.260> no<00:01:37.620> laughs<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.220> i

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
computer there is no laughs at all i

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.480 
computer there is no laughs at all i
just<00:01:38.400> keep<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> reg<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.750> 50<00:01:40.229> 60<00:01:40.650> FPS<00:01:41.130> but

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
just keep the reg of like 50 60 FPS but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
just keep the reg of like 50 60 FPS but
here<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:43.220> best<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.700> 30<00:01:45.710> now

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
here is just in best case like 30 now

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.420 
here is just in best case like 30 now
maybe<00:01:47.430> 60<00:01:47.940> also<00:01:48.409> but<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.400> just

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
maybe 60 also but it's just they just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.200 
maybe 60 also but it's just they just
jump<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.390> much<00:01:52.040> one<00:01:53.040> moment<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.580> have<00:01:53.700> 60<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
jump so much one moment you have 60 and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
jump so much one moment you have 60 and
then<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> 50<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.040> by

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
then you go down to 50 it's just by

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.510 
then you go down to 50 it's just by
second

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.420 
is
it's<00:02:14.360> beautiful<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.460> did<00:02:16.730> try<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.030> play<00:02:17.540> on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it's beautiful and I did try to play on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.060 
it's beautiful and I did try to play on
the<00:02:19.430> normal<00:02:20.210> texture<00:02:20.780> pack<00:02:20.990> only<00:02:21.350> non<00:02:21.710> texture

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
the normal texture pack only non texture

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.400 
the normal texture pack only non texture
pack<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.910> was<00:02:23.090> about<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.600> same<00:02:23.780> then<00:02:24.170> was

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
pack and it was about the same then was

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
pack and it was about the same then was
no<00:02:24.650> different<00:02:25.070> at<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.730> FPS<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
no different at all on the FPS and I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.320 
no different at all on the FPS and I
also<00:02:28.430> think<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.890> exactly<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.090> same

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
also think that it's exactly the same

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.930 
also think that it's exactly the same
FPS<00:02:33.050> when<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.440> was<00:02:33.560> playing<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:34.220> integrated

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
FPS when I was playing on integrated

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.750 
FPS when I was playing on integrated
graphic<00:02:35.420> card<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.780> mean<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.110> don't<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:37.190> any

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
graphic card I mean I don't see any

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.450 
graphic card I mean I don't see any
different

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.140 

so<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.330> my<00:02:43.510> opinion<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:45.190> process<00:02:45.940> of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
so in my opinion is just this process of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.510 
so in my opinion is just this process of
which<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.630> not<00:02:47.140> handling<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.490> well<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.720> pain

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.130
