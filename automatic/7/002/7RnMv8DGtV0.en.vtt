00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.980
 very good to all my dear friends 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.169
 again a new tutorial today them 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 I come to bring the new dio in version 7 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.369
 this is the latest version that has 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.800
 gone for what is very good and also 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.750
 comes with more animations plus objects and 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.640
 many more things with which we 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 will serve to make our videos what 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.710
 give us a much more effective way I 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.449
 seen a script version 7 that is in the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.000
 page times and if I remember correctly 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.010
 but it's beta and it comes with some 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 bugs like for example we put a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.479
 animation to a character and without knowing by 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.699
 what the character starts to throw 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.269
 back and finally that bothers 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.129
 much 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.799
 I also complain about the scenes when you're 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.140
 recording good this god does not come with 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.629
 that bug this gave to the user 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.400
 Carlos de 900 which I will leave the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.670
 channel in the description so that what 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.670
 visit good without saying more let's go to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 tutorial we will first download the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.110
 file that I will leave in the description 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.600
 I will not waste time explaining how 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.630
 download a mediafire file because 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 is very easy well then we will this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 rar file what we will do is open the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.240
 folder of 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.730
 our gta san andreas I here have 3 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.950
 gta each with their respective bikes 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.110
 of each series I do this to not have 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.660
 all in the same gta since you can 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.280
 fuck with so many mods well then 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.130
 we enter the data folder and what 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.110
 we will stick there well now we will go to 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.660
 my documents and we will stick it on the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 folder user files of your gta a detail 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.740
 if they do not have this folder they should 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.560
 cla downloaded or 3 or 4 or cla 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.600
 well I do this procedure in case 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.340
 doubts because sometimes when you paste the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.740
 folder so that in the folder data to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.840
 Sometimes it does not work and it is better to stick it on 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.150
 the two sites if you want and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.820
 they are sure that it works like this only 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.640
 paste the in the data folder I do 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.820
 so to not have problems well now 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.220
 let's go to the gta once here we give to 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.670

 well now I will show you some 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 animations that this god brings 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.030
 As you can see, they are very useful for the series 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.030
 of action terror adventures and so on 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.740

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.010
 computer houses and many other things 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.960
 useful with which we can make a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.850
 good series of whatever is all that 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.190
