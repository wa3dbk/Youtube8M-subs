with some more snow videos so this time

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.480 
with some more snow videos so this time
I<00:00:16.209> brought<00:00:16.780> out<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.199> sand<00:00:17.560> king<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.010> I'm

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
I brought out the sand king and I'm

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.599 
I brought out the sand king and I'm
going<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:18.940> try<00:00:19.510> and<00:00:19.869> conquer<00:00:20.560> chiliad<00:00:21.250> without

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
going to try and conquer chiliad without

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.179 
going to try and conquer chiliad without
using<00:00:22.119> or<00:00:22.300> with<00:00:22.720> using<00:00:23.109> the<00:00:23.380> leaf<00:00:23.589> least

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
using or with using the leaf least

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.249 
using or with using the leaf least
amount<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.670> paths<00:00:24.939> possible<00:00:25.929> last<00:00:26.080> time

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
amount of paths possible last time

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.400 
amount of paths possible last time
that's<00:00:26.439> a<00:00:26.589> good<00:00:26.740> start<00:00:27.009> so<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.990> on<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.230> more

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
that's a good start so I'm on the more

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.900 
that's a good start so I'm on the more
difficult<00:00:29.439> side<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.400> map<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.609> actually

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
difficult side of the map to actually

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.410 
difficult side of the map to actually
use<00:00:31.330> no<00:00:31.539> paths<00:00:31.779> I<00:00:32.140> know<00:00:32.410> on<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.710> other<00:00:32.830> side<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
use no paths I know on the other side it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.480 
use no paths I know on the other side it
is<00:00:34.510> actually<00:00:34.900> much<00:00:35.500> much<00:00:35.650> easier<00:00:35.710> but<00:00:36.400> I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
is actually much much easier but I

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.440 
is actually much much easier but I
thought<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:36.760> side<00:00:36.940> would<00:00:37.030> be<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.150> little<00:00:37.330> bit

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
thought this side would be a little bit

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.010 
thought this side would be a little bit
more<00:00:37.540> interesting<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.530> let's<00:00:39.370> go<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:40.510> conquer

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
more interesting so let's go to conquer

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.530 
more interesting so let's go to conquer
chiliad<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.130> as<00:00:42.400> I<00:00:42.580> was<00:00:42.730> driving<00:00:42.910> up<00:00:43.180> here<00:00:43.360> or

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
chiliad so as I was driving up here or

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.590 
chiliad so as I was driving up here or
flying<00:00:44.200> up<00:00:44.350> here<00:00:44.440> cheese<00:00:44.680> week<00:00:44.830> it<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
flying up here cheese week it the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600 
flying up here cheese week it the
visibility<00:00:47.200> at<00:00:47.380> this<00:00:47.770> part<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.190> map<00:00:48.340> is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
visibility at this part of the map is

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.390 
visibility at this part of the map is
actually<00:00:49.540> crazy<00:00:49.990> it's<00:00:50.380> so<00:00:50.710> hard<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.190> see

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
actually crazy it's so hard to see

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.700 
actually crazy it's so hard to see
things<00:00:51.700> it<00:00:51.970> if<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.140> compare<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:54.430> my<00:00:55.710> my

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
things it if you compare this to my my

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.940 
things it if you compare this to my my
drifting<00:00:57.340> video<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.170> difference

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
drifting video the difference

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.270 
drifting video the difference
invisibility<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:04.059> actually<00:01:04.449> insane<00:01:05.280> with

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
invisibility is actually insane with

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240 
invisibility is actually insane with
with<00:01:06.610> overcast<00:01:07.119> it<00:01:07.509> is<00:01:08.110> even<00:01:08.800> worse<00:01:08.980> like

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
with overcast it is even worse like

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.570 
with overcast it is even worse like
right<00:01:09.910> now<00:01:10.060> it's<00:01:10.270> actually<00:01:11.020> not<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.320> bad<00:01:11.740> but

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
right now it's actually not that bad but

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.500 
right now it's actually not that bad but
it's<00:01:12.750> definitely<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.640> definitely<00:01:15.760> not<00:01:16.210> that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
it's definitely it's definitely not that

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.950 
it's definitely it's definitely not that
great<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.290> up<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.860> here<00:01:18.100> but<00:01:18.670> anyways<00:01:19.000> yeah<00:01:19.900> I

great and up up here but anyways yeah I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.990 
great and up up here but anyways yeah I
was<00:01:20.080> flying<00:01:20.290> up<00:01:20.530> here<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.550> just<00:01:21.640> it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
was flying up here and it's just it's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.140 
was flying up here and it's just it's
just<00:01:22.210> crazy<00:01:22.870> with<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.320> snow<00:01:23.620> it's<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
just crazy with this snow it's a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.610 
just crazy with this snow it's a
definitely<00:01:25.150> very<00:01:25.390> very<00:01:25.630> cool<00:01:25.870> I'm<00:01:26.080> loving

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
definitely very very cool I'm loving

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.250 
definitely very very cool I'm loving
this<00:01:26.710> stuff<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:28.060> believe<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.750> does<00:01:29.020> reduce

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
this stuff it I believe it does reduce

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.360 
this stuff it I believe it does reduce
your<00:01:29.620> grip<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.070> tiny<00:01:30.430> little<00:01:30.670> bit<00:01:30.940> which<00:01:32.190> we<00:01:33.190> do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
your grip a tiny little bit which we do

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.430 
your grip a tiny little bit which we do
need<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.550> be<00:01:34.150> wary<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.540> especially<00:01:35.050> climbing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
need to be wary of especially climbing

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.090 
need to be wary of especially climbing
mountains<00:01:35.770> with<00:01:36.340> no<00:01:37.030> paths<00:01:37.680> except<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:38.830> want

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
mountains with no paths except I do want

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.890 
mountains with no paths except I do want
to<00:01:39.130> jump<00:01:39.850> over<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.000> this<00:01:40.180> path<00:01:40.420> here<00:01:40.720> or<00:01:40.780> else

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
to jump over to this path here or else

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.709 
to jump over to this path here or else
I'm<00:01:41.080> not<00:01:41.530> gonna<00:01:41.830> make<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.310> make<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.760> up

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
I'm not gonna make it make it up

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.510 
I'm not gonna make it make it up
there<00:01:45.719> we<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.929> nice<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.500> job

wanted<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.659> sneak<00:01:52.109> up<00:01:52.640> Mount<00:01:53.640> Juliet<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.329> we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
wanted to sneak up Mount Juliet now we

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
wanted to sneak up Mount Juliet now we
can<00:01:54.569> we<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.990> go<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.259> easy<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.460> we

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
can we can go the easy way here or we

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
can we can go the easy way here or we
can<00:01:57.119> try<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.539> make<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.079> little<00:01:58.829> bit<00:01:59.069> more

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
can try and make it a little bit more

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.139 
can try and make it a little bit more
difficult

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
difficult

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
difficult
that's<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.959> more<00:02:01.560> difficult<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:04.490> maybe

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's so more difficult it is maybe

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.930 
that's so more difficult it is maybe
more<00:02:05.819> stupid<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:07.319> is

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
more stupid it is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.410 
more stupid it is
alright<00:02:08.940> let's<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.560> better

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
alright let's I think we can do better

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.809 
alright let's I think we can do better
we<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.510> definitely<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.459> come<00:02:14.459> on

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
we can definitely make that come on

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.240 
we can definitely make that come on
Oh<00:02:15.530> will<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.130> though<00:02:17.459> Oh<00:02:19.010> Arno<00:02:20.010> cut

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
Oh will we make that though Oh Arno cut

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.940 
Oh will we make that though Oh Arno cut
don't<00:02:20.640> cut<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.930> cut<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.349> oh<00:02:22.650> oh<00:02:23.579> no<00:02:24.150> no
