doesn't<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> flash<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:43.020> see

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.280 
doesn't have the flash so you can see
here<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> sensing<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:45.960> geared

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
here on the sensing that it was geared

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
here on the sensing that it was geared
without<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> flash<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> should<00:01:48.360> fit<00:01:48.540> in

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
without the flash but this should fit in

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.730 
without the flash but this should fit in
there<00:01:48.869> perfectly<00:01:50.000> as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.509> does

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
there perfectly as you can see it does

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.230 
there perfectly as you can see it does
so<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> guys<00:01:53.310> wanted<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> pick<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so if you guys wanted to pick up this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
so if you guys wanted to pick up this
with<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.930> extra<00:01:55.170> tab<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> Kali<00:01:56.909> not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
with a little extra tab this is Kali not

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.209 
with a little extra tab this is Kali not
that<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> leather<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> believe<00:01:59.009> this

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that this is leather so I believe this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.350 
that this is leather so I believe this
is<00:01:59.460> leather<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> inside<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:03.329> outside

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is leather on the inside the outside

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.249 
is leather on the inside the outside
feels<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> plastic

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
feels more like a plastic

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
doesn't look too bad even though it's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
got a little opening there for that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.240 
got a little opening there for that
flash<00:02:39.489> for<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.770> Galaxy<00:02:42.489> e7

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250

yeah that Galaxy Tabs seven and there

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.400 
yeah that Galaxy Tabs seven and there
you<00:02:49.239> got<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.690> fab<00:02:49.959> which<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.260> pretty

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you got this little fab which is pretty

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.160 
you got this little fab which is pretty
nice<00:02:50.590> too<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:50.950> close<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.630> believe<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.050> has

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
nice too so close and I believe this has

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.600 
nice too so close and I believe this has
got<00:02:53.350> some<00:02:53.560> kind<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.770> magnetic<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> does

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
got some kind of magnetic as it does

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.030 
got some kind of magnetic as it does
kind<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.000> stay<00:02:55.450> close<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.750> its<00:02:56.050> own<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
kind of stay close on its own but the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.370 
kind of stay close on its own but the
reason<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.400> got<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.989> when<00:02:59.260> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
reason they got this is this when you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.330 
reason they got this is this when you
open<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.940> you're<00:03:00.940> able<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.330> fold<00:03:01.660> this<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.470> this

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
open it you're able to fold this in this

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.449 
open it you're able to fold this in this
position<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.870> also<00:03:05.140> acts<00:03:05.500> as<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.950> little

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
position and this also acts as a little

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.180 
position and this also acts as a little
like<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> little<00:03:07.360> grip<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:08.590> when<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.830> put<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.100> on

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
like a little grip so when you put it on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.000 
like a little grip so when you put it on
the<00:03:09.400> table<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:11.110> supposed<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.769> kind<00:03:11.980> of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the table it's supposed to like kind of

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.880 
the table it's supposed to like kind of
give<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.549> little<00:03:13.140> slide<00:03:14.140> as<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.709> can

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
give you that little slide as you can

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.100 
give you that little slide as you can
see<00:03:15.130> it's<00:03:15.280> not<00:03:15.459> really<00:03:15.760> working<00:03:16.110> actually

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
see it's not really working actually

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.350 
see it's not really working actually
that<00:03:17.920> good<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:19.330> does<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:21.180> knob<00:03:22.180> over

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
that good this does have the knob over

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.180 
that good this does have the knob over
here<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.290> off<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.830> little<00:03:24.070> too

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
here but I think it's off a little too

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.050 
here but I think it's off a little too
much<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.150> see<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.660> see<00:03:26.290> how<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.709> this

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
much and you see just see how on this

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.759 
much and you see just see how on this
this<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> curved<00:03:29.440> part

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
this one is actually on the curved part

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.330 
this one is actually on the curved part
and<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:31.239> one<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.630> actually<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.980> further

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
and this one is actually back further

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.370 
and this one is actually back further
and<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.299> reason<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.720> back<00:03:34.930> further<00:03:35.200> is

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
and the reason is back further is

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.860 
and the reason is back further is
because<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.130> much<00:03:36.610> open<00:03:37.120> here<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
because this is much open here as you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.860 
because this is much open here as you
can<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.880> one<00:03:40.060> as<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.269> can<00:03:40.390> see<00:03:40.540> it's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
can see in this one as you can see it's

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.330 
can see in this one as you can see it's
only<00:03:41.049> has<00:03:41.350> opening<00:03:41.890> for<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.400> micro<00:03:43.890> SD<00:03:44.890> slot

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
only has opening for that micro SD slot

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.539 
only has opening for that micro SD slot
there<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.810> way<00:03:46.959> if<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.860> were<00:03:48.040> actually

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
this actually would be closed here all

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.150 
this actually would be closed here all
the<00:04:00.640> way<00:04:00.730> from<00:04:00.940> here<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:02.350> here<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.040> way

here further so this is not gonna help
if<00:04:09.220> you're<00:04:09.430> gonna<00:04:09.549> want<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.120> use<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.480> as<00:04:10.600> a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
if you're gonna want it to use it as a

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.800 
if you're gonna want it to use it as a
stand<00:04:11.049> or<00:04:11.200> actually<00:04:12.090> maybe<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.360> keep<00:04:13.570> that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
stand or actually maybe you keep that

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.590 
stand or actually maybe you keep that
flap<00:04:14.140> up<00:04:14.440> which<00:04:14.850> don't<00:04:15.850> like<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.480> way

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
flap up which don't like to get that way

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.390 
flap up which don't like to get that way
it<00:04:16.750> will<00:04:16.930> help<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.769> actually

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
it will help it to actually

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
it will help it to actually
stand<00:04:20.400> there<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.269> since<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:21.629> is<00:04:21.810> kind<00:04:21.870> of

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
stand there and since this is kind of

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.570 
stand there and since this is kind of
like<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.289> rubbery<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.889> guess<00:04:23.129> that's<00:04:23.370> what's

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
like a rubbery so I guess that's what's

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.689 
like a rubbery so I guess that's what's
gonna<00:04:24.449> help<00:04:24.719> it<00:04:24.900> stay<00:04:25.319> up<00:04:25.349> as<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.770> can<00:04:25.919> see<00:04:26.129> but

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
gonna help it stay up as you can see but

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.929 
gonna help it stay up as you can see but
if<00:04:26.819> you<00:04:26.909> fold<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.330> in<00:04:27.599> like<00:04:28.520> pretty<00:04:29.520> much<00:04:29.699> like

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:29.939 
if you fold it in like pretty much like

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.839 
if you fold it in like pretty much like
the<00:04:30.060> way<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.360> advertised<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.050> be<00:04:31.199> used<00:04:31.469> you

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
the way it's advertised to be used you

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.969 
the way it's advertised to be used you
can<00:04:32.849> see<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.270> um<00:04:33.449> it's<00:04:34.169> not<00:04:34.229> gonna<00:04:34.409> work<00:04:34.620> in

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
can see that um it's not gonna work in

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.399 
can see that um it's not gonna work in
that<00:04:35.219> situation<00:04:35.879> maybe<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.110> too

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
that situation maybe this is too

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.830 
that situation maybe this is too
slippery<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.849> other<00:04:39.139> this<00:04:40.139> also<00:04:41.840> this

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
slippery and the other this also this

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
this little slide in here that groove in

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.209 
this little slide in here that groove in
here<00:04:48.090> that's<00:04:48.990> what<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.620> meant<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.129> be

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
this and use it as a kind of like a

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.330 
this and use it as a kind of like a
little<00:04:56.310> tilt<00:04:57.080> up<00:04:58.080> display<00:04:58.560> which<00:04:58.919> is<00:04:58.949> pretty

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
little tilt up display which is pretty

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.939 
little tilt up display which is pretty
nice<00:04:59.520> because<00:04:59.759> you<00:04:59.969> can<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.860> can

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
nice because you can have it and you can

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:12.070 
nice because you can have it and you can
see<00:05:02.219> there<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.930> works<00:05:07.020> very<00:05:07.289> good<00:05:09.860> let's<00:05:10.860> go<00:05:11.009> to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
see there it works very good let's go to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.409 
see there it works very good let's go to
some<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.110> these<00:05:13.199> pre-loaded<00:05:13.979> ones<00:05:14.159> so<00:05:15.060> it's

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
some of these pre-loaded ones so it's

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.179 
some of these pre-loaded ones so it's
got<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:15.569> nice<00:05:15.750> angle<00:05:16.229> at<00:05:16.379> this<00:05:16.590> point<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:16.979> this

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:17.189 
got a nice angle at this point like this

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.820 
got a nice angle at this point like this
which<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.610> very<00:05:17.789> nice<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:19.139> this<00:05:19.379> is<00:05:19.500> actually

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
which is very nice so this is actually

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.129 
which is very nice so this is actually
more<00:05:20.129> if<00:05:20.789> I<00:05:20.909> was<00:05:21.029> actually<00:05:21.330> using<00:05:21.629> this<00:05:21.900> is

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
more if I was actually using this is

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.300 
more if I was actually using this is
very<00:05:22.620> nice<00:05:22.830> this<00:05:23.099> way<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> think<00:05:24.419> um<00:05:25.310> even

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
very nice this way so I think um even

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.519 
very nice this way so I think um even
though<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.460> won't<00:05:26.639> be<00:05:26.789> able<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.089> actually<00:05:27.349> if<00:05:28.349> I

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
though I won't be able to actually if I

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.050 
though I won't be able to actually if I
really<00:05:28.889> want<00:05:29.069> to<00:05:29.129> really<00:05:29.339> want<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:29.759> I<00:05:29.789> guess

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
really want to really want it to I guess

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.600 
really want to really want it to I guess
I<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.539> keep<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:31.080> flap<00:05:31.770> up<00:05:32.099> in<00:05:32.460> that

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
I can just keep that flap up in that

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.260 
I can just keep that flap up in that
direction

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
direction

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.490 
direction
it<00:05:33.449> was<00:05:33.569> pattern<00:05:34.440> that<00:05:35.930> it's<00:05:36.930> not<00:05:37.080> gonna<00:05:37.199> hold

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
it was pattern that it's not gonna hold

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.390 
it was pattern that it's not gonna hold
to<00:05:38.190> good<00:05:38.490> as<00:05:38.639> you<00:05:38.789> can<00:05:38.909> see<00:05:40.009> but<00:05:41.009> maybe<00:05:41.219> in

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
to good as you can see but maybe in

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.010 
to good as you can see but maybe in
another<00:05:41.639> desk<00:05:42.029> or<00:05:42.300> something<00:05:42.659> that<00:05:42.779> might<00:05:42.900> be

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
another desk or something that might be

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.079 
another desk or something that might be
able<00:05:43.139> to<00:05:43.289> hold<00:05:43.500> in<00:05:44.099> that<00:05:44.159> in<00:05:44.639> that<00:05:44.849> little

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
able to hold in that in that little

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.360 
able to hold in that in that little
position<00:05:45.539> so<00:05:46.080> anytime<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.500> could<00:05:46.560> use<00:05:46.919> this<00:05:47.099> is

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
position so anytime I could use this is

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.360 
position so anytime I could use this is
maybe<00:05:47.610> when<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.029> have<00:05:48.479> a<00:05:48.919> keyboard<00:05:49.919> with<00:05:50.129> tiny

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
maybe when I have a keyboard with tiny

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.700 
maybe when I have a keyboard with tiny
ends<00:05:50.520> off<00:05:50.729> okay<00:05:51.330> yeah<00:05:51.839> once<00:05:52.199> you<00:05:52.349> have<00:05:52.500> this

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
ends off okay yeah once you have this

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.089 
ends off okay yeah once you have this
opened<00:05:53.339> up<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:54.360> didn't<00:05:54.810> show<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:54.930> guys<00:05:55.199> you

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
opened up I didn't show you guys you

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.390 
opened up I didn't show you guys you
know<00:05:56.189> you<00:05:56.219> can<00:05:56.520> flip<00:05:57.000> this<00:05:57.150> back<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.810> this

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
know you can flip this back and this

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.399 
know you can flip this back and this
basically<00:05:59.400> pins<00:05:59.729> over<00:06:00.389> like<00:06:00.569> this<00:06:00.810> it

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
basically pins over like this it

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.850 
basically pins over like this it
actually<00:06:01.800> works<00:06:02.699> up<00:06:02.879> pretty<00:06:03.060> good<00:06:03.150> because<00:06:03.449> it

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
actually works up pretty good because it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.040 
actually works up pretty good because it
it<00:06:04.860> almost<00:06:05.099> gives<00:06:05.849> you<00:06:05.969> a<00:06:06.029> nice<00:06:06.360> grip<00:06:06.689> so<00:06:06.990> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
it almost gives you a nice grip so you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.499 
it almost gives you a nice grip so you
can<00:06:07.409> hold<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:10.110> Galaxy<00:06:10.560> Tab<00:06:10.770> in<00:06:11.509> anything

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
can hold the Galaxy Tab in anything

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.110 
can hold the Galaxy Tab in anything
quickly<00:06:13.169> look<00:06:13.409> at<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.669> Samsung<00:06:14.669> Galaxy<00:06:15.330> Tab

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
quickly look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab
