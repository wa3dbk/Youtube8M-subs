version on the website version to point

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.929 
version on the website version to point
out<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> Settings<00:01:05.369> panel<00:01:05.460> and

hit restore from version 2 point and to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.190 
hit restore from version 2 point and to
your<00:01:08.850> credentials<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.080> your

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
your credentials and move all your

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
your credentials and move all your
points<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.250> no<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.640> loses<00:01:11.820> anything<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
points over so no one loses anything and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
points over so no one loses anything and
then<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> course<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.430> main<00:01:14.610> sponsor

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
then of course we have the main sponsor

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
then of course we have the main sponsor
functionality<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.650> works<00:01:16.920> similar<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
functionality so this works similar to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
functionality so this works similar to
before<00:01:18.240> however<00:01:18.990> since<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.860> native<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
before however since it's all native it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.450 
before however since it's all native it
loads<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.119> faster<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> we've<00:01:22.799> also<00:01:22.979> added

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
loads a lot faster and we've also added

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
loads a lot faster and we've also added
some<00:01:23.640> ranking<00:01:24.180> algorithms<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.960> sure

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
some ranking algorithms to make sure

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
some ranking algorithms to make sure
that<00:01:25.770> bad<00:01:26.070> sponsors<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:27.420> pushed<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that bad sponsors get pushed to the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
that bad sponsors get pushed to the
bottom<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.380> working<00:01:28.619> ones<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.430> always<00:01:29.670> seen

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
bottom and working ones are always seen

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
bottom and working ones are always seen
near<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> top<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> try<00:01:31.740> doing<00:01:31.950> any

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
near the top so we can try doing any

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
near the top so we can try doing any
sponsor<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.390> instance<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.960> try<00:01:34.200> hotels<00:01:34.740> com
