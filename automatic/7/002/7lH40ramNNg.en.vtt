00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.190
 to the beautiful girls I hope that it 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.690
 find either migaloo let's go 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.639
 make this beautiful pen and that 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.760
 You may also have other options 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.030
 use and we will recycle products in this 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.949
 case is going to be a cardboard tube well yo 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.440
 I'm going to use a cardboard tube where 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.510
 it came entangled what is plastic but 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.700
 we can use like these little ones that 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.520
 come in the rolls of paper the case 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.890
 recycle and we can do many things and 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.460
 ideas with them we will use the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.110
 paper 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.230
 I'm going to use paper this time 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.290
 because I'm going to decorate it with ribbon but 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.510
 It can also be cardboard or cardboard 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.820
 we are going to use scissors and in the case of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.150
 children of preference that are scissors of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.980
 round tip so they do not get hurt 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.510
 I'm also going to use diurex from the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.790
 that are going out of style are very 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.970
 cheap to me this little package cost me 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.020
 only 10 pesos plus use 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.299
 resistol silicon or glue that is 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.610
 dry fast I'm going to use this to 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.380
 ease and good as my son also 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.870
 he does the things that I do for him 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 it is easier 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.740
 well let's mark with the tube 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.480
 cardboard on the sheet of paper the circle 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.750
 that will be the basis for not being 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.540
 come out our pencils there is like 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.940
 can see is already marked and what 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.660
 let's do is leave this a half 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.060
 centimeter to trim it so that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.200
 let's have space and not be so right to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 final we are going to this one to remove the excess 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.210
 let's cut it out and well, if they're 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 children that is with observation of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.320
 some adult so that there is no 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.510
 problem as you can see I'm not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
 cutting exactly what is the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.630
 line but a little bit above the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.810
 line so that it is well stuck on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 our tube 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 like a little eyelash 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 well I'm going to start hitting what is the 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.739
 of urex or colored adhesive tape 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 pink that is the one that I chose because I 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.930
 like this color there are some that come 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.540
 in little flowers of different stripes 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 they are fashionable right now so I'm going to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.300
 cover little by little everything that is the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.370
 tube 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.820
 they can make combinations too 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.860
 They can use their imagination and how can they 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.000
 see then look here I'm already moving forward 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.970
 a little more 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.890
 remember that you can choose what 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.580
 which are the adhesive tapes of your 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.700
 preference 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.740
 here I finished and good if you guys 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.330
 they decide already it is one hundred of each one I do not 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.450
 I will also fill in the part of 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.360
 inside so it looks nice 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.600
 now let's paste what is the cap 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 at the bottom of our tube applying 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.670
 resistol as you can see there if they reach 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.290
 use resistol which is drying 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 Quick be careful so that your fingers 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 do not stick or get hurt 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.410
 preference that it be this although it takes a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.490
 little bit more to dry but they do not have 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.490
 no problem 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.920
 Now we are going to stick it 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.490
 I resist to the edge of the circle and go 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.490
 to stick it 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
 I prefer you to recommend it 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.400
 after they have pasted the diurex 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.810
 so they can see how it looks and cut the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.849
 surplus 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.250
 besides that if you need a little bit of 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.160
 direct so you can not see what they can 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.430
 paste already at the end as you can see here 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.660
 we are cutting the surplus and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.660
 ready 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 there they are 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.610
 Now I'm going to use these 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.620
 diamond and all that have glue 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.960
 to decorate it you can put 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.270
 little stamps can put pieces of 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.300
 heart-shaped fabric is already the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.310
 imagination of each 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.350
 these are very useful to paste in 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.570
 any part by the glue that 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.300
 they bring and well I'm going to decorate it with my 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.720
 name so you know it's mine and from 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.720
 nobody else 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.790
 there is how you can see can 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.340
 cut them out and make the figures that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.080
 want hearts or whatever it is to me 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.019
 they like things a little simpler 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.790
 but it is to everyone's liking how they can 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.980
 see there is already I stuck the ibex for 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.980
 inside and on the bottom 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.770
 and in girls I hope you liked it 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.180
 it's very quick to subscribe they were sent 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.180
 many kisses and blessings 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.380
 do not
