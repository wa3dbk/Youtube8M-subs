00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.470
 nutritional management of calves has the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 objective of providing the greatest weight to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 weaning possible 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.710
 traditionally in Brazil children 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.860
 have been deforested with varying age 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.359
 between seven and eight months weighing about 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.060
 150 kg 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.160
 this weaning age does not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.980
 too much of a knife in terms of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 reproductive efficiency while the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.480
 calf is already consuming food 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 bulky and concentrated 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 as an adult but to observe 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 the highest weight at weaning will be 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.780
 I need to take care of your nutrition from the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.780
 birth 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.230
 during the first four weeks of life 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.590
 single food consumed by the calf or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.630
 milk as long as the matrix is ​​good 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 milk producer and whether the calf is 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.240
 in good sanitary conditions with health 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.100
 to accompany your mother is created and the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.910
 necessary condition for the animal to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 remain well nourished in the first 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.470
 weeks of calf life of your device 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.110
 digestive function works as if it were a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.830
 monogastric animals despite the presence of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.479
 of the reticulum and hamas rumen 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 these buildings to take goals are not 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.410
 functional 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.170
 the milk is ingested intercepted by a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.869
 called the esophageal portal, which 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.060
 is formed by diverting milk that goes directly 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.640
 for the amasio where the digestion occurs 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 dominance without going through the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.440
 me 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.680
 the initial intake of milk and the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.539
 form of management done by the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.580
 compensates for the fact that the management bodies 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.789
 of calf fibers are not 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.979
 working with the passing of days 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.000
 however the bad starts to get 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.220
 develop 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.530
 stimulated by the increasing consumption of 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.509
 particularly solid foods 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 until it is fully active 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.590
 around 30 days old 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.210
 the calves begin to pass even though 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.130
 in small quantity 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.660
 up to two months milk is still the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.090
 main food 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.790
 the consumption of milk varies according to the weight 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.170
 of the calf corresponding to about 10% 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 of their live weight only in the third month 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.940
 of calf life is that the consumption of 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.710
 forage passes propitiate weight gain 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.720
 significant 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.310
 besides grazing the calves also 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.380
 need water 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.390
 despite being on a diet 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.540
 liquid milk base for children 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.250
 consume water with a few days of life 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.010
 so drinkers must offer 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.320
 ease of access to calves for 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.990
 that have clean water and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.240
 fresh for consumption at will 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.730
 they can and should consume 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.980
 Good quality mineral mix which 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.320
 composition is different when compared to 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.959
 provided to the matrices 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.209
 the thigh should be low enough to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.380
 that calves can become accustomed to 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.380
 consume this supplement
