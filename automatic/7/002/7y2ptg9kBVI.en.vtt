it's<00:00:41.309> loading<00:00:41.910> properly<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.719> some

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it's loading properly but for some

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's loading properly but for some
reason<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.140> can't<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> DLC<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> function

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

so when I open a saved game under like

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.189 
so when I open a saved game under like

say the Sheik of Cadiz it will allow me
to<00:00:52.289> load<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.370> says<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.120> allowed<00:00:54.300> to

the<00:00:59.100> game<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.800> with<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> great

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the game is over and so with a great

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.680 
the game is over and so with a great
deal<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> effort<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> could<00:01:03.390> probably

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
deal of effort I think I could probably

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.210 
deal of effort I think I could probably
make<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.350> saves<00:01:04.710> function<00:01:05.430> again<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.600> for

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
make these saves function again but for

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
make these saves function again but for
for<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> reason<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> fact<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
for that reason and also the fact that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
for that reason and also the fact that
the<00:01:09.900> new<00:01:09.990> microphone<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> fact<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the new microphone and the fact that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
the new microphone and the fact that
version<00:01:12.140> 1.0<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.500> 1.1<00:01:13.920> 01<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.409> i<00:01:16.409> think

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
version 1.0 or 1.1 01 is out now i think

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
version 1.0 or 1.1 01 is out now i think
i'm<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> unfortunately<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
i'm going to unfortunately have to just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
i'm going to unfortunately have to just
end<00:01:19.200> those<00:01:19.590> series<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.759> been

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
end those series i know i have been

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.249 
end those series i know i have been
saying<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.570> were<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.049> hold

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
saying that they were just put on hold

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.609 
saying that they were just put on hold
but<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.340> doesn't<00:01:23.520> make<00:01:23.759> sense<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.619> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but it just doesn't make sense to to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
but it just doesn't make sense to to
really<00:01:25.979> try<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> put<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> effort<00:01:27.659> into

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
really try to put a lot of effort into

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
really try to put a lot of effort into
an<00:01:28.170> old<00:01:28.409> version<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> game<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:30.150> there's

those<00:02:00.479> situations<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.210> do

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
those situations so I don't like to do

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.380 
those situations so I don't like to do
this<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.899> hate<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.409> end<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.920> series<00:02:05.390> uncomplete

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this I hate to end a series uncomplete

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.510 
this I hate to end a series uncomplete
but<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.619> other<00:02:07.770> thought<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
but the other thought that I have is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.290 
but the other thought that I have is
that<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.420> game<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.649> endless<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.790> open

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that this game is so so endless so open

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.150 
that this game is so so endless so open
that<00:02:12.510> there

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
that there

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.920 
that there
really<00:02:13.400> isn't<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.850> true<00:02:14.090> end<00:02:14.330> unless<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.840> get

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
really isn't a true end unless you get

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930 
really isn't a true end unless you get
to<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> very<00:02:15.140> end<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.490> playable

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to the very end of the the playable

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.900 
to the very end of the the playable
timeline<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.490> well<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.580> prince<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.850> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
timeline and well the prince and the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.630 
timeline and well the prince and the
Thane<00:02:20.120> Northumbria<00:02:21.110> playthrough<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:21.650> 220

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
Thane Northumbria playthrough was 220

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.180 
Thane Northumbria playthrough was 220
episodes<00:02:23.060> long<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:24.590> wasn't<00:02:24.950> even<00:02:25.010> like

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
episodes long and it wasn't even like

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.950 
episodes long and it wasn't even like
halfway<00:02:25.580> into<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.000> game<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.900> was

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
halfway into the game and that was

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.870 
halfway into the game and that was
before<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.530> old<00:02:27.830> gods<00:02:28.010> came<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.430> extending

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
before the old gods came out extending

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.620 
before the old gods came out extending
the<00:02:29.000> game<00:02:29.180> time<00:02:29.420> by<00:02:29.630> 200<00:02:30.080> years<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.630> think

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
the game time by 200 years so I think

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.210 
the game time by 200 years so I think
it's<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.170> quite<00:02:33.320> feasible<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.920> play

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
it's just not quite feasible to play

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's just not quite feasible to play
each<00:02:34.430> playthrough<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.210> very<00:02:35.420> end<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.930> if

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
each playthrough to the very end and if

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
each playthrough to the very end and if
you're<00:02:37.070> looking<00:02:37.340> for<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.520> huge<00:02:38.150> completionist

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you're looking for a huge completionist

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.290 
you're looking for a huge completionist
style<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.490> prince<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.120> thing

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
style the prince and the thing

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960 
style the prince and the thing
Northumbria<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.050> best<00:02:42.230> bet<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:43.670> other

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
Northumbria is the best bet but other

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.420 
Northumbria is the best bet but other
than<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.840> recommend<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.710> consider<00:02:45.980> some

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
than that I recommend you consider some

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.510 
than that I recommend you consider some
of<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.610> new<00:02:46.760> series<00:02:47.030> they<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:48.250> better<00:02:49.250> I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
of the new series they are better I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.040 
of the new series they are better I
think<00:02:49.820> because<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.210> microphone<00:02:50.600> quality<00:02:50.720> is

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
think because the microphone quality is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.820 
think because the microphone quality is
much<00:02:51.230> higher<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.730> don't<00:02:53.390> know<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.870> anyway<00:02:54.800> I

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
much higher and I don't know so anyway I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.230 
much higher and I don't know so anyway I
just<00:02:54.950> wanted<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> give<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.610> some<00:02:56.000> sort<00:02:56.210> of

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
just wanted to give you some sort of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.420 
just wanted to give you some sort of
closure<00:02:56.480> on<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:57.320> you're<00:02:57.890> upset<00:02:58.010> about<00:02:58.160> it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
closure on this if you're upset about it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.310 
closure on this if you're upset about it
