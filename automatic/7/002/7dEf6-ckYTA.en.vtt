your<00:04:21.900> skin<00:04:22.320> will<00:04:22.440> get<00:04:22.560> used<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.219> then

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
your skin will get used to it and then

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.920

it<00:04:23.580> won't<00:04:23.880> actually<00:04:24.150> work<00:04:25.279> days<00:04:26.279> I

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
it won't actually work days I

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.810 
it won't actually work days I
not<00:04:27.259> using<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.680> same<00:04:27.889> foundation<00:04:28.430> every<00:04:28.669> day

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.340 
not using the same foundation every day
i<00:04:28.850> think<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.780> mean<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.080> use<00:04:30.320> a

i think is I mean you use a

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.170 
i think is I mean you use a
different<00:04:30.740> one<00:04:30.860> every<00:04:31.009> other<00:04:31.190> day<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.090> would

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
different one every other day so I would

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.930 
different one every other day so I would
use<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.479> for<00:04:32.720> special<00:04:33.110> occasions<00:04:33.199> like<00:04:34.100> to
