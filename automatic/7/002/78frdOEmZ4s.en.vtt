by my friend mr. seananners or adam and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.609 
by my friend mr. seananners or adam and
i'm<00:00:14.580> starting<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.030> take<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> class<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.929> editing

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
i'm starting to take a class in editing

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.490 
i'm starting to take a class in editing
so<00:00:16.980> i<00:00:17.010> thought<00:00:17.400> i'd<00:00:17.550> try<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:18.270> my<00:00:18.600> knowledge

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500

chest<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.830> not<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.730> fancy<00:00:20.939> as

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

seananners<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.020> i<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> most

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
seananners but i think the most

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.420 
seananners but i think the most
important<00:00:24.480> thing<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.010> video

head so the point is I have myself in in
this<00:00:41.070> box<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.480> gameplay<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.079> be

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this box here and the gameplay should be

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.010 
this box here and the gameplay should be
here<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.070> pointing<00:00:44.600> directing<00:00:45.600> correctly

just oblivious and I think I'm playing

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.870 
just oblivious and I think I'm playing
on<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.299> line<00:01:54.299> bar<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.549> not

on a line bar here so I'm really not

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that advantage to not have a great

talk<00:02:12.370> listen<00:02:12.579> to<00:02:12.760> me<00:02:12.879> instead<00:02:13.629> of<00:02:13.659> using

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
talk listen to me instead of using

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
talk listen to me instead of using
predator<00:02:14.499> harrier<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.249> payload<00:02:15.849> i<00:02:16.030> started

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
predator harrier and payload i started

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.660 
predator harrier and payload i started
using<00:02:16.569> harrier<00:02:17.200> pavelow<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:18.010> chopper<00:02:18.400> gunner

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
using harrier pavelow and chopper gunner

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.360 
using harrier pavelow and chopper gunner
as<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:18.969> can<00:02:19.090> see<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.359> my<00:02:19.389> other<00:02:19.659> free-for-alls

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
as you can see in my other free-for-alls

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.509 
as you can see in my other free-for-alls
and<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.670> reason<00:02:21.999> why<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.209> pretty<00:02:22.599> much<00:02:22.780> that

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and the reason why is pretty much that

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.890 
and the reason why is pretty much that
using<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.609> predator<00:02:25.060> pretty<00:02:25.480> much<00:02:25.629> means

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
using the predator pretty much means

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.929 
using the predator pretty much means
that<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.409> get<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:27.549> only<00:02:27.670> get<00:02:27.909> one

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
that you have to get you only get one

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.940 
that you have to get you only get one
kill<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.689> predator<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.379> free-for-all

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
kill with a predator a free-for-all

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.879 
kill with a predator a free-for-all
pretty<00:02:30.489> much<00:02:30.670> all<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.060> time<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.079> if<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.769> use

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
pretty much all the time so if you use

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.399 
pretty much all the time so if you use
and<00:02:33.609> then<00:02:33.969> you<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.299> get<00:02:34.480> your<00:02:34.870> another

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
and then you have to get your another

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.940 
and then you have to get your another
kill<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.519> get<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> hairier<00:02:37.569> but<00:02:37.829> if<00:02:38.829> you<00:02:38.919> use

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
kill to get that hairier but if you use

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.099 
kill to get that hairier but if you use
Harriers<00:02:39.549> instead<00:02:39.939> you<00:02:40.060> really<00:02:40.389> focus<00:02:40.659> more

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
Harriers instead you really focus more

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.899 
Harriers instead you really focus more
to<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.530> seven<00:02:41.950> kill<00:02:42.099> streak<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.519> when

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
to get the seven kill streak and when

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.869 
to get the seven kill streak and when
you<00:02:42.999> have<00:02:43.090> gotten<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:44.530> just<00:02:44.680> need<00:02:45.609> one

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
you have gotten that you just need one

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.119 
you have gotten that you just need one
more<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.750> doesn't<00:02:47.349> know<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.709> mean<00:02:47.859> your

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
more for and doesn't know I mean your

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.729 
more for and doesn't know I mean your
Harrier<00:02:48.489> pretty<00:02:48.700> much<00:02:48.819> does<00:02:49.090> all<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.480> work<00:02:49.510> so

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
Harrier pretty much does all the work so

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.140 
Harrier pretty much does all the work so
then<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.889> get<00:02:51.069> your<00:02:51.099> pay<00:02:51.430> blow<00:02:51.639> pretty<00:02:51.879> much

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
then you get your pay blow pretty much

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.610 
then you get your pay blow pretty much
instantly<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:54.419> here<00:02:55.419> i<00:02:55.449> got<00:02:56.079> killed<00:02:56.379> by<00:02:56.500> an

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
instantly and here i got killed by an

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.920 
instantly and here i got killed by an
MLG<00:02:56.919> pro<00:02:57.250> hanging<00:02:57.699> up<00:02:57.819> at<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> ceiling<00:02:58.569> there

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
MLG pro hanging up at the ceiling there

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.610 
MLG pro hanging up at the ceiling there
but<00:02:59.889> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.129> can't<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.549> do<00:03:01.620> nothing

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
but you know you can't really do nothing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.170 
but you know you can't really do nothing

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180

as possible before they actually get to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.159 
as possible before they actually get to

gets<00:03:27.280> me<00:03:27.459> every<00:03:27.849> time<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:28.299> know<00:03:28.419> when<00:03:28.599> they're

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
gets me every time you know when they're

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.599 
gets me every time you know when they're
going<00:03:29.169> down<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.919> they're<00:03:30.280> pretty<00:03:30.489> much

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
going down and they're pretty much

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.670 
going down and they're pretty much
invincible<00:03:31.209> two<00:03:31.750> bullets<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.259> everything

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
invincible two bullets and everything

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.770 
invincible two bullets and everything
which<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.669> doesn't<00:03:33.939> make<00:03:34.209> sense<00:03:34.449> if<00:03:34.689> you

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
which really doesn't make sense if you

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.199 
which really doesn't make sense if you
ask<00:03:34.870> me<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:35.949> pick<00:03:36.069> up<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.310> UMP<00:03:36.819> which<00:03:37.060> is

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
ask me and I pick up a UMP which is

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.659 
ask me and I pick up a UMP which is
really<00:03:37.989> rapidly<00:03:38.530> become<00:03:39.009> my<00:03:39.250> favorite<00:03:39.790> SMG

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
really rapidly become my favorite SMG

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.179 
really rapidly become my favorite SMG
since<00:03:42.669> I<00:03:42.790> upped<00:03:43.389> my<00:03:43.780> sensitivity<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:44.949> play

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
since I upped my sensitivity I now play
