it's<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.760> way<00:00:20.880> kado<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:22.140> their<00:00:23.150> layout

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
it's the the way kado has their layout

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.759 
it's the the way kado has their layout
track<00:00:25.590> deal<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.689> they<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> master<00:00:28.470> sets

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
track deal as they have the master sets

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.849 
track deal as they have the master sets
which<00:00:29.689> there's<00:00:30.689> two<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> them<00:00:31.260> there's<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.679> M

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
which there's two of them there's an M

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.880 
which there's two of them there's an M
one<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.430> M<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.559> M<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.809> basically<00:00:36.890> an

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
one and M two the M one is basically an

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.319 
one and M two the M one is basically an
OLE<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.410> M<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.610> oval<00:00:41.910> with

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
OLE and then the M two is an oval with

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.080 
OLE and then the M two is an oval with
this<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:44.160> M<00:00:44.370> 2<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.379> m1

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
this so an M 2 is basically is is an m1

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
this so an M 2 is basically is is an m1
with<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.809> sold<00:00:49.140> together<00:00:49.469> as

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
with this but it's sold together as

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
with this but it's sold together as
opposed<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> separately<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> how<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> got

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
opposed to separately which is how I got

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
opposed to separately which is how I got
it<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.199> look<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.210> see

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it so we will look at this you can see

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
it so we will look at this you can see
it's<00:00:57.510> gonna<00:00:57.600> turn<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.050> control<00:00:58.440> switch<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it's gonna turn out control switch a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.819 
it's gonna turn out control switch a
left<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.510> right

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
left and a right

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.049 
left and a right
electrical<00:01:01.829> turn<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
electrical turn out which is just a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
electrical turn out which is just a
switch<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:04.470> hundred<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.100> forty<00:01:05.339> eight

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
switch two hundred and forty eight

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
switch two hundred and forty eight
millimeter<00:01:05.850> straight<00:01:06.150> track<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:07.140> equates

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
millimeter straight track which equates

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
millimeter straight track which equates
to<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:07.950> nine<00:01:08.400> point<00:01:08.700> seven<00:01:09.090> inches<00:01:10.430> it's<00:01:11.430> 64

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to about nine point seven inches it's 64

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
to about nine point seven inches it's 64
millimeters<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.900> straight<00:01:13.200> track<00:01:13.320> which

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
millimeters of straight track which

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
millimeters of straight track which
equates<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> roughly<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> half<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
equates to roughly two and a half to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.550 
equates to roughly two and a half to
three<00:01:15.930> inches<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:21.170> take<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
three inches and we will take it out of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
three inches and we will take it out of
its<00:01:22.740> box<00:01:23.659> here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.810> hopefully<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
its box here and hopefully it's all in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
its box here and hopefully it's all in
frame<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:29.060> display<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.270> what

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
frame I do not have a display of what

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
frame I do not have a display of what
the<00:01:30.990> camera<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.520> moment<00:01:32.640> because

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the camera can see at the moment because

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.719 
the camera can see at the moment because
my<00:01:33.360> phone<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.900> being<00:01:34.229> slightly<00:01:34.740> ignorant

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.749 

these<00:01:38.729> guys<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.960> control<00:01:40.619> switches<00:01:40.920> they

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
these guys are the control switches they

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.730 
these guys are the control switches they
are<00:01:42.150> very<00:01:42.780> similar<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.530> construction<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.329> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
are very similar in construction to the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.870 
are very similar in construction to the
power<00:01:46.740> pack<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:51.119> box<00:01:52.340> they're<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.549> similar

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
power pack the box they're very similar

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.350 
power pack the box they're very similar
in<00:01:54.210> construction<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:57.149> here

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
in construction to this right here

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
in construction to this right here
they're<00:01:58.110> made<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> same<00:01:58.759> color<00:01:59.759> metal<00:02:01.130> we

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
they're made of the same color metal we

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.719 
they're made of the same color metal we
may<00:02:02.250> wonder<00:02:02.430> how<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:03.240> hook<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:04.729> good

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
may wonder how they hook up good

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.130 
may wonder how they hook up good
questions<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> side

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
questions if you look on the side

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.729 
questions if you look on the side
there's<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.129> electrical<00:02:08.940> contacts<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.739> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
there's two electrical contacts here and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.130 
there's two electrical contacts here and
there<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.790> buttons

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
there just like buttons

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.630 
there just like buttons
oh<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.530> don't<00:02:13.710> think<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.280> frame<00:02:14.460> this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
oh I don't think that was in frame this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000 
oh I don't think that was in frame this
-<00:02:14.850> electrical<00:02:15.450> contacts<00:02:15.990> here<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.890> work

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
- electrical contacts here and they work

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.790 
- electrical contacts here and they work
just<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.280> buttons<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.570> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> snap

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
just like buttons and they kind of snap

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.060 
just like buttons and they kind of snap
together<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:21.350> it's<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:22.680> pretty<00:02:22.710> good

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
together and it's on there pretty good

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.420 
together and it's on there pretty good
so<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.360> control<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.710> switches<00:02:26.130> like

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so you can control the switches like

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
so you can control the switches like
that<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.390> don't<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.780> plug<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.140> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that and you don't have to plug these in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.900 
that and you don't have to plug these in
or<00:02:28.500> wire<00:02:28.680> them<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.070> because<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.670> have

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
or wire them in because they just have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.070 
or wire them in because they just have
very<00:02:30.870> similar<00:02:33.200> switch<00:02:34.200> deal<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:36.570> you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
very similar switch deal and then you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.470 
very similar switch deal and then you
can<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.500> multiple<00:02:37.770> ones<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.640> look

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
can have multiple ones because look

fairly well you know occasionally I'll

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.960 
fairly well you know occasionally I'll
bump<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.140> they'll<00:02:55.350> come<00:02:55.560> unplugged<00:02:56.280> from

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
slightly curved track I'm not even gonna

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
slightly curved track I'm not even gonna
try<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.630> figure<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.900> an<00:03:34.080> angle<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.830> one

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
once again this is a unit track it's

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.420 
once again this is a unit track it's
very<00:03:39.480> very<00:03:39.840> well<00:03:40.049> put<00:03:40.230> together<00:03:40.350> I'm<00:03:41.280> not

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
gonna take it out of the foam because

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.039 
gonna take it out of the foam because
pretty<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.820> what<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.390> see<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.900> what

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
pretty much what you see here is what

pretty much what you see here is what
you<00:03:46.140> get<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:47.250> comes<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.760> six<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:49.049> these<00:03:49.890> nine

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
you get it comes with six of these nine

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.470 
you get it comes with six of these nine
inch<00:03:50.820> sections<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.870> track<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.760> there's<00:03:54.209> three

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
inch sections of track so there's three

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.050 
inch sections of track so there's three
there<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.110> there's<00:03:56.010> three<00:03:56.280> right<00:03:56.910> in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
there and then there's three right in

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.840 
there and then there's three right in
there<00:03:57.209> also<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:59.900> will<00:04:00.900> look<00:04:01.049> at<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.459> switches

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
there also I will look at the switches

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.289 
there also I will look at the switches
though<00:04:03.060> they<00:04:03.690> have<00:04:04.280> electrical<00:04:05.280> connections

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.940 

got<00:04:09.299> away<00:04:09.570> I've<00:04:09.840> lost<00:04:10.140> control<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.799> wire

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
got away I've lost control of the wire

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.539 
got away I've lost control of the wire
and<00:04:11.660> it's<00:04:12.660> got<00:04:12.900> these<00:04:12.989> little<00:04:13.320> clips<00:04:13.590> which

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
and it's got these little clips which

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.219 
and it's got these little clips which
again<00:04:15.350> plug<00:04:16.350> into<00:04:17.120> these<00:04:18.120> guys<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.660> they're

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
again plug into these guys and they're

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.110 
again plug into these guys and they're
very<00:04:19.380> tight<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.890> there<00:04:20.160> because<00:04:20.430> they<00:04:20.760> key<00:04:20.940> in

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
very tight in there because they key in

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.279 
very tight in there because they key in
and<00:04:21.680> it's<00:04:22.680> really<00:04:23.250> neat<00:04:23.780> another<00:04:24.780> thing<00:04:25.080> is

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
and it's really neat another thing is

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.420 
and it's really neat another thing is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
they have a group

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.200 
they have a group
so<00:04:26.790> when<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.120> place<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.870> track<00:04:28.710> down<00:04:29.210> firmly

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
so when you place the track down firmly

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.950 
so when you place the track down firmly
or<00:04:30.660> flat<00:04:31.350> on<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.620> ground<00:04:31.830> they<00:04:32.370> stay<00:04:32.960> flush

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
or flat on the ground they stay flush

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.090 
or flat on the ground they stay flush
with<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.850> surface<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:37.229> whatever's<00:04:37.800> on<00:04:37.919> there

with the surface of whatever's on there

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.390 
with the surface of whatever's on there
and<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.479> construction<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.380> switches

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
and to the construction of the switches

crazy that's how these feel they feel

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.950 
crazy that's how these feel they feel
very<00:05:03.180> very<00:05:04.050> well<00:05:04.770> made<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:06.000> believe<00:05:06.389> it's<00:05:06.810> got<00:05:06.930> a

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
very very well made I believe it's got a

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.120 
very very well made I believe it's got a
magnet<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:08.010> that<00:05:08.190> makes<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.610> kind<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.120> hop

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
magnet in it that makes it kind of hop

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.640 
magnet in it that makes it kind of hop
hop<00:05:11.130> back<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.370> forth<00:05:11.729> or<00:05:11.940> help<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.110> hop<00:05:13.440> back

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
hop back and forth or help it hop back

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.800 
hop back and forth or help it hop back
and<00:05:13.680> forth<00:05:14.010> especially<00:05:14.190> with<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.820> electronic

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.240 

action<00:05:18.810> because<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:19.680> can<00:05:19.830> actually<00:05:19.979> control

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
action because you can actually control

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.330 
action because you can actually control
this<00:05:20.610> both<00:05:21.180> manually<00:05:21.810> by<00:05:22.289> using<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:23.070> little

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
this both manually by using that little

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.560 
this both manually by using that little
tab<00:05:23.520> there<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:24.229> you<00:05:25.229> can<00:05:25.410> control<00:05:25.710> it

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
tab there and you can control it

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.430 
tab there and you can control it
electronically<00:05:27.570> from<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:29.400> switch<00:05:29.970> here<00:05:30.240> I

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
electronically from the switch here I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.370 
electronically from the switch here I
can<00:05:31.440> see<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:32.250> length<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:33.000> wire<00:05:33.240> being<00:05:34.229> an

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
can see the length of wire being an

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.589 
can see the length of wire being an
issue<00:05:35.150> because<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.389> is<00:05:37.760> if<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:39.240> were<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.360> guess

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
issue because this is if I were to guess

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.930 
issue because this is if I were to guess
I'd<00:05:39.780> say<00:05:39.960> maybe<00:05:40.199> two<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.160> half<00:05:41.370> foot<00:05:41.669> long

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
I'd say maybe two and a half foot long

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.820 
I'd say maybe two and a half foot long
so<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:43.110> not<00:05:43.320> that<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.960> not<00:05:46.139> that<00:05:46.169> long<00:05:46.500> so

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
so it's not that it's not that long so

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.070 
so it's not that it's not that long so
if<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.099> have<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> longer<00:05:47.820> layout<00:05:48.630> or<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.840> bigger

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
if you have a longer layout or a bigger

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.740 
if you have a longer layout or a bigger
layout<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:50.550> you<00:05:50.849> have<00:05:51.030> multiple<00:05:51.449> switches

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
layout and you have multiple switches

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.250 
layout and you have multiple switches
you<00:05:52.620> may<00:05:52.770> have<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.130> end<00:05:53.280> up<00:05:53.460> cutting<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:55.050> wire

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
you may have to end up cutting the wire

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.010 
you may have to end up cutting the wire
somewhere<00:05:55.919> along<00:05:56.099> the<00:05:56.280> middle<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:57.020> splicing

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
somewhere along the middle and splicing

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.020 
somewhere along the middle and splicing
in<00:05:58.169> more<00:05:58.620> wire<00:05:59.039> to<00:05:59.460> make<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:01.550> make<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.699> the

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
in more wire to make the make the the

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.600 
in more wire to make the make the the
length<00:06:03.210> work<00:06:03.510> so<00:06:03.900> that<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.080> still<00:06:04.289> have

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
length work so that you still have

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.350 
length work so that you still have
electronic<00:06:05.610> control<00:06:05.940> over<00:06:06.810> your<00:06:06.900> switches

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
electronic control over your switches

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.909 
electronic control over your switches
other<00:06:09.360> than<00:06:09.630> that<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:09.990> think<00:06:10.050> this<00:06:10.380> is<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.590> really

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
other than that I think this is a really

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.870 
other than that I think this is a really
good<00:06:11.039> set<00:06:11.630> its<00:06:12.949> retails<00:06:13.949> for<00:06:14.099> you<00:06:14.760> know

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
good set its retails for you know

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.980 
good set its retails for you know
roughly<00:06:15.180> 65<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.800> 80<00:06:17.639> dollars<00:06:18.150> was<00:06:18.630> what<00:06:18.840> I've

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
roughly 65 to 80 dollars was what I've

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.830 
roughly 65 to 80 dollars was what I've
seen<00:06:19.199> on<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:20.190> internet<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.760> was<00:06:21.300> able<00:06:21.630> to<00:06:21.659> pick

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
seen on the internet I was able to pick

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.770 
seen on the internet I was able to pick
it<00:06:21.960> up<00:06:22.050> for<00:06:22.289> about<00:06:22.590> sixty<00:06:23.370> dollars<00:06:26.360> other<00:06:27.360> than

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
it up for about sixty dollars other than

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.689 
it up for about sixty dollars other than
that<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:28.229> mean<00:06:28.470> that<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:29.010> construction<00:06:29.490> of

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
that I mean that the construction of

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.080 
that I mean that the construction of
everything<00:06:30.090> is<00:06:30.210> very<00:06:30.479> very<00:06:30.659> well<00:06:31.139> I<00:06:32.090> don't

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
everything is very very well I don't

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.000 
everything is very very well I don't
really<00:06:33.210> uh<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.810> don't<00:06:34.500> really<00:06:34.620> have<00:06:34.800> anything

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
really uh I don't really have anything

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.390 
really uh I don't really have anything
else<00:06:35.250> to<00:06:35.430> say<00:06:35.460> it's<00:06:36.060> just<00:06:36.229> really<00:06:37.229> good

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
else to say it's just really good

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.129 
else to say it's just really good
let<00:06:38.850> me<00:06:38.940> see<00:06:39.090> if<00:06:39.180> I<00:06:39.240> can<00:06:39.360> find<00:06:39.479> a<00:06:39.630> picture<00:06:39.960> of

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
let me see if I can find a picture of

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.370 
let me see if I can find a picture of
what<00:06:40.470> it<00:06:40.560> makes<00:06:40.770> uh<00:06:41.729> yeah<00:06:42.120> here<00:06:42.389> we<00:06:42.479> go<00:06:42.600> if<00:06:43.139> you

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
what it makes uh yeah here we go if you

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.140 
what it makes uh yeah here we go if you
can<00:06:43.650> see<00:06:43.860> this<00:06:45.800> this<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:47.010> what<00:06:47.160> it<00:06:47.280> does<00:06:47.460> you

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
can see this this is what it does you

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150 
can see this this is what it does you
have<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.449> main<00:06:48.630> line<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.169> then<00:06:49.590> it<00:06:49.889> does<00:06:50.130> a

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
have the main line and then it does a

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.969 
have the main line and then it does a
little<00:06:50.550> siding<00:06:51.150> so<00:06:51.900> you<00:06:51.960> can<00:06:52.169> park<00:06:52.440> a<00:06:52.530> train<00:06:52.770> on

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
little siding so you can park a train on

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.120 
little siding so you can park a train on
there<00:06:53.250> or<00:06:53.490> you<00:06:54.090> know<00:06:54.240> just<00:06:54.570> using<00:06:54.720> for<00:06:55.130> car
