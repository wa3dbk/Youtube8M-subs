 hello to all and welcome to a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.929
 show you how to do a little 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.970
 tripod for iphone or ipod for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:20.960
 portable with only a trombone 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.119
 so to start you open 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.119
 fully your trombone 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.499
 do not hesitate to force 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.380
 or so then published by the middle 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 here 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.760
 so it's a bit like a clamp 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:10.440
 then you fold the two points to 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.440
 pretty much in the middle 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.320
 that's how it is and you fall back again 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.910
 once the tip and only the taste 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.910
 spikes upwards 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.630
 So here you go then 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.270
 your iphone your cellphone like that it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 need a movie and in that direction 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.519
 but also if you unfold a bit like 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.129
 that and you and that the past you have to 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.129
 a smoke down and in the direction 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.540
 up so that's it's very 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.790
 simple a very simple trick for 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.690
 make a tripod for your 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.209
 cellphone 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.510
