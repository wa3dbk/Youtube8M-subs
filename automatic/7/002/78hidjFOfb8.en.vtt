00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.042
 Welcome 

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:05.417
 I noticed in your comments that the most you want is to identify 

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.500
 I also want to teach you about myself 

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.667
 I hope that I have answered your questions 

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:12.292
 I was born in Istanbul 

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:16.250
 After finishing my high school directly I decided to start life early 

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.000
 She started working as a fashion consultant at FICO, 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
 After work about a year and a half in (FICO) 

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.458
 She continued to work as a fashion consultant at Bronovias, 

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.833
 Spain for brides 

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:33.458
 During my work in Bronovias, I received a very nice offer from (Schnell) 

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:37.500
 And there she worked for a year and a half in the Deputy Director's Center 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.042
 And at that time, my mother Khalili was at that time and my husband was now 

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:45.458
 I had already mentioned to my husband that I wanted to go back to school 

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.750
 He also supported me a lot on this subject 

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.750
 Then I left my profession aside and went back to school life 

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.042
 At university she studied at the Faculty of Communications 

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.958
 During my studies I was working in advertising agencies from another side 

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.083
 After graduation my first work experience was in 

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.958
 Advertising agency as a customer service representative 

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:05.875
 My next job was in an international magazine as an online shopping manager 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.125
 That period was the turning point for me 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.292
 I started working since I was 19 

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:15.208
 I will not create my personal work or complete my career as a specialist 

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:20.750
 And at the moment I found myself having created a site for new technologies and initiatives 

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.458
 This site contains personal clips 

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.750
 In fact there is a Mero you know 

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.625
 She likes the music and shopping 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.208
 Besides my love and great interest in technology 

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.583
 But I'm still very new in this area 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.667
 In the coming days, I hope to succeed in this field, God willing 

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.417
 After marriage she moved to the continent of Europe 

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.167
 My family is still in the Asian continent 

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:45.250
 My only complaint is that I do not see them very often 

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.792
 I have two sisters I am middle sister 

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.167
 My older sister has a beautiful child as much as the beauty of the world 

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.833
 And on the one hand I try to learn how to become an aunt 

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:57.875
 I love very much to be active and to discover the world with whom I love 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.292
 And on the occasion my husband crazy Panjazj aircraft 

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:04.833
 It is his hobby, though, that he takes long hours, but I am happy to see him happy 

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.292
 This is a brief summary of my life 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 If you have any questions I will answer them happily 

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:12.375
 Thanks for watching me 

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.292
 In the hope of meeting with safety
