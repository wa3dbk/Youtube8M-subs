00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.009
 library or Nazarbayev schools of Kazakhstan 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.509
 Karaganda gathered to discuss 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.910
 problems of further development 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.280
 library science is the age of innovation and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 digital technology sergey visoko saw 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.500
 visited one of the training courses 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
 advanced training 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 Nazarbayev schools became guides 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 advanced ideas in the educational field 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 countries libraries of these schools by 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.240
 equipment is not inferior to European 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 countries 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 these are libraries of a new formation and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.960
 focused on electronic technology 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 even work built on traditional 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 principles do not stand still and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 developing in Karaganda Nazarbayev in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.050
 school is not the first year there 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 bookcrossing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.680
 or some public book exchange 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.660
 foundation this form of work with a book 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.660
 developing all over the world 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.060
 I am very pleased that this bookcrossing 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.310
 standing here because we can at any 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.080
 time to come take the book you need 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.570
 on which book gum we can 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.000
 share the views of other students 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.730
 who read books during 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 classical and territories asya nagano and 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.500
 that the books on physics 7 from home 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.540
 the main wealth of any library and and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.910
 information potential but in the century 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.820
 digital technology book as physical 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.790
 the object may disappear what is the future 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.920
 the library business was talking about it 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.710
 at the library Nazarbayev school seminar and 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 whether there will be a library at all 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.720
 as it exists for 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.240
 Today, digital technologies are actively 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.190
 being introduced and library do today 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.080
 computer and global network can 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.420
 enjoy everywhere even in the forest with 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.340
 holographic keyboard holography 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.170
 already allows you to communicate with the other person in 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.550
 three-dimensional space you need and 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.649
 computer accessories 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.899
 for example a computer on the nose in the form of glasses 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.060
 please any manipulations with him about 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.580
 performed by voice soon 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.229
 tailors will dress customers in 15 minutes 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.270
 are preparing a scanner that will 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.369
 produce fabric computers medicine 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.420
 can already make not just 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.910
 bone tissue 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.069
 but let's say vertebra or jaw physical 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.060
 things cease to dominate 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.880
 a place in our book life is also expensive 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.530
 typography on paper will become digital 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.319
 every day there are changes in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 the technical world and the library how would 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.360
 goes by the wayside and so that it does not 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.020
 happened we have to and thats leg 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 by time 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.220
 paradox with the development of new technologies 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 must rise and cognitive 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 student level but the opposite happens 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 level of knowledge decreases on the exam and 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.400
 even cribs stop cooking why 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.380
 There are dozens of hundreds of e-carriers 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 information through which you can find out 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.670
 all without unnecessary stress only 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.069
 authenticity and and sometimes causes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.720
 doubt but do not pay attention 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.760
 from of such information 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.240
 educational situation accounts 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.530
 today work libraries come here 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.510
 our viewers 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.690
 it feels me it is absolutely everything 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.980
 changing changes 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.870
 for the library it changes absolutely 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 all because they leave 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.210
 for example print and close as 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.190
 this is strange before the book was strong 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.270
 libraries now the book is getting smaller and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.650
 smaller mouse matters for 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.480
 cove libraries oddly enough all 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.400
 more and more importance is gained 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.920
 digital object needs to search for new 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 forms of work using the latest 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.989
 technology and oddly enough 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.940
 return love and books as a carrier 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 not only knowledge but also culture let it 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.860
 will be digitally but still 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.160
 will remain a book servers orders first 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.160
